[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "In this course, students will examine Western \"art music,\" also referred to as \"classical music.\" During the quarter, by exploring the history of the Western canon from the \"medieval\" period to the present, and defining and discussing musical form and compositional techniques, students will acquire basic musical literacy and skills for critical listening. Furthermore, we will situate and dissect musical genres in their respective historical, political, and philosophical contexts in order to gather an understanding of history through music. Students should expect to prepare readings and listening assignments for discussion and to turn in two concert reports; there will also be listening quizzes and comprehensive midterm and final exams.", "name": "Introduction to Music", "section": "20", "location": "RCMA 1-160", "topic": "", "course": "170-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 1:00PM - 3:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/MUSIC/GEN_MUS/170-0/40292", "instructor": [""], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "40292", "subject": "GEN_MUS"}]
