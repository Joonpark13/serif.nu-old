Furthermore, we will situate and dissect musical genres in their respective historical, political, and philosophical contexts in order to gather an understanding of history through music. Students should expect to prepare readings and listening assignments for discussion and to turn in two concert reports; there will also be listening quizzes and comprehensive midterm and final exams.", "name": "Introduction to Music", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "170-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 1:00PM - 3:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/MUSIC/GEN_MUS/170-0/40292", "instructor": [""], "id": "40292", "subject": "GEN_MUS"}]
