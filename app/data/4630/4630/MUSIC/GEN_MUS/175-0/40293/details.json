Why is it there at all? Are we meant to pay attention to it? Why this music and not some other? What does the music mean? How do we know? Are political or ethical implications attached to certain ways of using music? Does music construct our interpretation of images, or vice versa? What is its relationship to other elements of film sound? What range of functions can it serve? How and why has film-music practice changed, and what continuities have persisted? Our primary texts will consist of a wide variety of films, centered on the classical Hollywood cinema (of the 1930s-50s) but extending back to silent film (and its live musical accompaniment) and forward to today's audio technologies and globalized entertainment industries. Orchestral scores and soundtracks based on popular music will both be considered; American movies will be juxtaposed to international cinema; and the conventions of Hollywood will be contrasted with critiques and challenges to its norms. No musical background is required as prerequisite."}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:30 PM (CT)", "subject": "GEN_MUS"}]
