[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "AFST 276-0-20 \"African Literature in Translation \" , Summer 2016, Richard Lepine <br/><br/>The course is primarily a survey of African oral verbal arts traditions, with an additional focus on the links between these traditions and African films. The original works of art, the objects of study in the course, are not literature in the strict sense of the term-written verbal art-but rather take form in oral performance or electronic media like film, TV, radio, recorded disks, and web-based digital media. However, in print and in English translation, the course examples from various genres of African oral verbal arts performances (riddles, poetry, proverbs, panegyric, folktales, trickster tales, hero tales, epics) are all experienced as literature for purposes of analysis and interpretation. Four African films will also serve as primary course \"texts\": Wend Kuuni (1982; Gaston Kabor\u00e9, dir.; Burkina Faso), Keita: Heritage of the Griot (1995; Dani Kouyat\u00e9, dir.; Burkina Faso); La vie est belle/Life Is Rosy (1987; Ngangura Mweze and Bernard Lamy, dirs.; Za\u00efre [Democratic Republic of Congo]), and Yeelen (Souleymane Ciss\u00e9, Mali, 1987, 105 min.). A major goal of the course is to explore the analytic approaches employed by scholars Harold Scheub and Robert Cancel, specialists in African oral traditions and their relationships with other arts media.", "name": "African Literature in Translation", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 318", "topic": "", "course": "276-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 10:00AM - 12:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/WCAS/AFST/276-0/40053", "instructor": ["Richard Marshall   Lepine"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "40053", "subject": "AFST"}]
