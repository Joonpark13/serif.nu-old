[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will survey the history of the British Empire from its modest beginnings under Queen Elizabeth I to its long twentieth-century decline. It will ask how a small island in northern Europe came to possess territory on six continents, with unquestioned dominance of the world's oceans. The course will grapple with narratives of colonization, resistance, collaboration and exchange, moving between the metropole and the colonies to examine those groups who gained from the empire and those who did not. It will ask how a liberal society justified the often brutal expansion of the empire abroad, and how all parties, Briton and non-Briton alike, understood and negotiated their place within it.", "name": "New Lectures in History", "section": "26", "location": "Harris Hall L06", "topic": "", "course": "300-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 6:00PM - 8:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/WCAS/HISTORY/300-0/40325", "instructor": ["Ryan Christopher Burns"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "40325", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
