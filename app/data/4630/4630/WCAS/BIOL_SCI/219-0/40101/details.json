Explain the importance of membrane function as well as the role of membrane lipids, protein components and membrane organization in eukaryotic cells.<br/>2. Explain how cellular components are targeted and distributed to different regions and compartments of a cell.<br/>3. Explain how cellular components of the cytoskeleton support a variety of cell functions, such as cell shape, division, movement, sensing the environment, and cell-cell communication.<br/>4. Explain how cell send, receive, and respond to signals from their environment, including other cells.<br/>5. Explain how cells coordinate and regulate cell division. <br/>6. Explain how an imbalance or mutation in normal cell processes can lead to cancer and other disease states."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Class participation, Active learning exercises, Lecture, online work"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Multiple quizzes, 2 exams, class participation, short homework questions"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Essential Cell Biology by Alberts et al., 4th edition, 2013 edition, Garland publishers, ISBN - 9780815344544"}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:30 PM (CT)", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
