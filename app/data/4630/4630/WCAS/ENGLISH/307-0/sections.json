[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "How might a long story or novella differ in structure and ambition from a shorter work? What is the nature of material that requires the relative expansiveness of a longer form, but not the breadth of a novel? In this class, students will plan and draft a long story or short novella of about 35-50 pages. Throughout the six weeks, students will read and discuss published models as points of departure for developing the form and substance of their own long work in installments. Portions of student work in progress will be workshopped. Novella proposals, readings, and drafting will be due in the first class. Be prepared to do a lot of writing, and to turn in work in every class.", "name": "Advanced Creative Writing", "section": "26", "location": "University Hall 318", "topic": "Writing the Novella", "course": "307-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 6:30PM - 9:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/WCAS/ENGLISH/307-0/40265", "instructor": ["Sheila Patricia Donohue"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "40265", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
