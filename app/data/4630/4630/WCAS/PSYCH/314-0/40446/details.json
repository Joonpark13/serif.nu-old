This seminar will instead focus upon the questions asked within the growing science of positive psychology. What is happiness? Can happiness be learned, or is our happiness &quot;setpoint&quot; mostly determined by genetics? Do we know ourselves well enough to know what makes us happy, and if not, why not? Does money make us happy? Relationships? Religion? How do people create a sense of meaning in their lives? What types of situations encourage cognitive mastery and creativity? How do we, as a society, encourage generosity and altruism? In this seminar, students will read a mix of recent scientific journal articles and books, will write opinion papers about the scientific findings, and will journal about their own experiences in trying to apply these findings to their own lives, using weekly well-being exercises. Students can expect to wrestle with some of the &quot;big questions&quot; about what makes a good life and a strong society in discussions with their classmates."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "No textbook - readings will be distributed via Canvas."}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
