[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Existentialism in film<br/> <br/>Through engagement with films by directors ranging from Robert Bresson, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, and Ingmar Bergman, to Woody Allen and Harold Ramis, we will study mid-to-late 20th century films whose common theme is the quest to understand the meaning of life, either actively, through taking up religious practice, or because the protagonists consider themselves inhabiting a godless and meaningless universe. Class lectures and discussions will treat existentialism, atheism, and the quest for philosophical truth to be found in these filmic portrayals of everyday life. Weekly written film critiques, class discussion, and an in-class presentation will form the basis of your grade.
