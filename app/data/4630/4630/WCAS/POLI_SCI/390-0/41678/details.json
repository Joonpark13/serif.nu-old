Despite renewed optimism in the recent years, the continent's overall economic performance is less than impressive and a source of animated debate both in academia and policy circles. After remarkable performance in the 1960s and the first half of 1970s, the continent suffered negative growth throughout the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s. Only a few countries managed to recover and return to the level of 1970 GDP per capita at the turn of the century. The first part of the course will analyze classical and alternative explanations to Africa's economic stagnation and underdevelopment. The second part will cover a range of responses and prescriptions, both orthodox and heterodox, to tackling growth stagnation and accelerating economic transformation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Books for Purchase<br/>Tim Kelsall, Business, Politics, and the State in Africa: Challenging the Orthodoxies on Growth and Transformation (London: Zed Books, 2013) <br/>Nicolas van de Walle, African Economies and the Politics of Permanent Crisis, 1979-1999 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001)<br/><br/>Other readings will be scanned and posted on canvas, and web links to journal articles will be included on the course syllabus."}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
