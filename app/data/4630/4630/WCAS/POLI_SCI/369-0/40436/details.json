This course analyzes the political, economic, and foreign policy revolutions that shook Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Through the lens of the Russian experience, we will examine key concepts in comparative politics, such as revolution, regime change, market formation, nationalism, and state building.<br/><br/>Whether you plan to professionally engage in politics, conduct international business, or simply be a well-educated global citizen, you need to know about Russia. It is the world's largest country by geographic size and the ninth largest country by population. It remains one of the world's only two nuclear superpowers. It is the world's largest oil producer and exporter. And it widely is considered - along with China, India, and Brazil - to be one of the world's most important emerging economies."}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
