[{"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "This class is based on the fundamental theories of human behavior and media consumption as a means to help understand new technologies, content opportunities, and relationship building with audiences. While the goal is to provide a framework that will be applicable throughout a person's career regardless of the state of innovation in the field, the class will be framed around the practice of interactive design. Students will present content-innovation strategies based on evidence from the course and in a team-based environment continually edit those ideas based on the accruing wisdom from the readings and discussions. Introductory principles of audience understanding, multicultural understanding, and 21st century media issues will permeate the course so that they gain a sophisticated analytical framework for the rapidly changing industry in which they are entering as well as the intellectual tools to adjust to and lead as that industry changes the future.", "name": "Frameworks for Modern Journalism", "section": "20", "location": "Meets in Non-General PurposeRm", "topic": "", "course": "402-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 9:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/JOUR/JOUR/402-0/40741", "instructor": ["Rachel Davis Mersey"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "40741", "subject": "JOUR"}]
