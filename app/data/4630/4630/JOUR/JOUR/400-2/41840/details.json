One goal of the class is for students to begin developing their own sense of an editor's role in shaping journalistic product, their own set of standards, and a way of thinking about these issues. Cases will come from a range of media. They will include a blend of classic and current-news situations. Most will include practical, ethical, best practices and market-based considerations. Cases will be developed in consultation with practicing professionals, and often will include a how-we-decided element, revealed after robust class discussion. Weekly assignments will be a concise written recommendation and justification, to be graded for quality of thought and integration of principles, not for the recommendation itself. A final &quot;exam&quot; paper will be a written articulation of the student's evolved editing/publishing ethos, which takes account of industry standards, but allows for individual reasoning and goals."}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:30 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
