Sports are a social institution no less than education, religion, or the military, and no less important. Sports are also oldest form of 'reality television' and the most expensive, highest-earning media product. This course is intended to help students interested in sports and sports journalism to improve their craft by identifying and explaining social meanings in the world of sports. In short, it's a sports class that looks at society through the lens of sports. Many are quick to see sports as a metaphorical training ground for 'life'. Life is this case includes commerce and industry, domestic and international politics (including war), gender identity and sexuality, race and ethnic relations, religion and spirituality, and popular culture from fashion to video games. This course considers sports in some of these various contexts. We do it through weekly monitoring of sports media, documentary films, and research and writing assignments.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to freshmen and above</li> <br/><li>Cross-listed as JOUR 390-0</li><br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:30 PM (CT)", "subject": "MIT"}]
