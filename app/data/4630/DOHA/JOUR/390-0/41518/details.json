Students will be charged with exploring the current migrant crisis from multiple angles, as well as looking into the motives behind the growing Islamophobia and Xenophobia in Germany, which is the birthplace of the PEGIDA (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the Occident) movement - a German anti-Islam political organization that today has many sympathizers across Western Europe. At the same time, students will explore the history of immigration to Germany, which started at the end of World War II and reached a new high in 2015 with over 1.1 million people expected to claim asylum.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to sophomores and above</li> <br/><li>Instructor permission is required</li><br/><li>Travel to Berlin is required for this course</li><br/><li>Class begins Sunday May 15 and ends June 9th.
