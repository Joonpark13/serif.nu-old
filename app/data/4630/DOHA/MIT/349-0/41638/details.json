Students will meet weekly with the instructor and other students to discuss the weekly readings and their relationship to events on the job sites, to share progress reports, and to address questions and concerns about the work they are completing in various media-related jobs. Since internships are linked to the academic progress of students in their department, critical reflection on work experiences is a necessity. Students are encouraged to explore the links and gaps between what they have learned in the classroom and what they are learning in the workplace.>/p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li> <br/><li>Open to MIT majors only, juniors and above</li> <br/><li>Students may register for 1-4 units with the instructor's permission</li> <br/><li>Consent of instructor required</li> <br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:30 PM (CT)", "subject": "MIT"}]
