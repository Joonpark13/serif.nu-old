As a minority religious community, American Muslims have responded and hoped to shape their own media narrative, but face enduring challenges relating to Islamophobia, race, neo-liberalism, and international events. This course examines the crafting of media narratives both about Islam and by Muslims in America. It also compares these narratives with the actual religious identities of Muslims in America over two centuries or more.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to freshmen and above</li> <br/><li>Open for Cross-Registration</li><br/><li>Cross-listed as JOUR 390-0</li><br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:30 PM (CT)", "subject": "MIT"}]
