[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "<p>This course will analyze how images of Islam are fashioned in the U.S. media in dialogue with (and/or ignorance of) the long history of Islam in America. As a minority religious community, American Muslims have responded and hoped to shape their own media narrative, but face enduring challenges relating to Islamophobia, race, neo-liberalism, and international events. This course examines the crafting of media narratives both about Islam and by Muslims in America. It also compares these narratives with the actual religious identities of Muslims in America over two centuries or more.</p>", "name": "Undergraduate Seminar", "section": "70", "topic": "Islam, America &amp; Media", "course": "398-0", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeSu 02:30PM - 05:30PM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/DOHA/MIT/398-0/41513", "instructor": ["Abraham Naseem Abusharif", "Zachary Valentine Wright"], "id": "41513", "subject": "MIT"}, {"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "<p>This is a survey course dedicated to the pretty simple proposition that sports are more than entertainment, more than popular culture. Sports are a social institution no less than education, religion, or the military, and no less important. Sports are also oldest form of 'reality television' and the most expensive, highest-earning media product. This course is intended to help students interested in sports and sports journalism to improve their craft by identifying and explaining social meanings in the world of sports. In short, it's a sports class that looks at society through the lens of sports. Many are quick to see sports as a metaphorical training ground for 'life'. Life is this case includes commerce and industry, domestic and international politics (including war), gender identity and sexuality, race and ethnic relations, religion and spirituality, and popular culture from fashion to video games. This course considers sports in some of these various contexts. We do it through weekly monitoring of sports media, documentary films, and research and writing assignments.</p>", "name": "Undergraduate Seminar", "section": "71", "topic": "Sports, Media &amp; Society", "course": "398-0", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeSu 09:00AM - 12:00PM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/DOHA/MIT/398-0/41514", "instructor": ["Amy Kristin Sanders"], "id": "41514", "subject": "MIT"}]
