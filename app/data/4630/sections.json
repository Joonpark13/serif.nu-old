While Hamlet intends the speech to be private, Shakespeare stages it for a public audience composed of people from all walks of English society. What appears to be an expression of individuality, then, is also shaped by and for the social networks in which the character and playwright lived. Would Hamlet have spoken differently had he known his words would go viral? Twenty-first century social networks such as Facebook have changed the way we present ourselves to the world, how we interpret and judge the experiences of others, how we define friendship, and how we receive and share information.
