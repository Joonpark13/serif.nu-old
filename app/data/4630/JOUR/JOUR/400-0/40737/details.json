Maybe Dorothea Lange's photos of the Great Depression are an inspiration. Or perhaps it's something more current such as the videos of Vice that make you take notice. Even if you have no interest in pursuing multimedia reporting to that extent, a basic knowledge of multimedia is imperative in Journalism today and this class is where it starts. This course will give students exposure to audio storytelling, photojournalism and video storytelling. Students will learn the software, hardware and production skills in each medium to transcend amateurish mistakes and report with sound, still pictures and video."}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:30 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
