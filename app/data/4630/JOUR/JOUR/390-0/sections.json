[{"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "\"Holding the Press Accountable: Laws, Norms, Markets & Architecture\"<br/><br/>This course has a practical goal and an intellectual one. The practical one is directed at your inner publisher (we all have one): to make you your own best risk counselor and to prepare you to talk knowledgeably with legal counsel about your work or the work of others. The latter is to situate those liability risks in the normative, economic and architectural features of the U.S. and international media systems. The course is rooted in the constitutional, common law, statutory and regulatory systems of media accountability used in the United States as they have developed in the 20th century, and especially since 1964. Wherever possible or useful we consult comparative law examples, mostly from the European Union. We begin the course normatively, by putting all this in the context of First Amendment theory and doctrine. After that it's communications law and policy, and each week we'll consider problems practical and principled.", "name": "Special Topics", "section": "20", "location": "Meets in Non-General PurposeRm", "topic": "Holding the Press Accountable: Laws Norms Markets", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 9:30AM - 12:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/JOUR/JOUR/390-0/41894", "instructor": ["Craig Llewellyn   Lamay"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "41894", "subject": "JOUR"}]
