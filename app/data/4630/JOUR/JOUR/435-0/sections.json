After researching the needs of audiences/users, examining the competitive landscape and identifying business and revenue possibilities, students build prototypes along with marketing strategies and business plans. We offer two different versions of the course: a two-quarter version (winter and spring quarters) in which Medill MSJ's are on teams that include students from other Northwestern schools, and a one-quarter version (summer quarter) for Medill MSJ's only. In both versions, faculty and outside advisors (including entrepreneurs and venture capitalists) advise students on how to give their ideas and prototypes the best chance of being successful. The course gives students real-world experience in what it takes to develop a successful media product and provides them with skills and techniques they can use to lead media innovation inside a company or in a startup environment.", "qtr": "Summer 2016", "name": "NUVention Innovation Project", "title": "JOUR JOUR 435-0-20 NUVention Innovation Project", "lmod": "5/1/16 6:30 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "William R Handy", "instructor_addr": ""}, {"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Andrew S Hullinger", "instructor_addr": ""}, {"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "James Vincent Distasio", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "435-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "In this class, small teams of students develop prototypes of media businesses or publications, either as new product concepts for existing publishers or as entrepreneurial ventures.
