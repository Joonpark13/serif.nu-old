[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is the third part of our year-long elementary course which constitutes an introduction to Arabic. The main focus of the class is Modern Standard Arabic, used for reading and writing. Considerable exposure to spoken Arabic varieties is included to help prepare students for spoken interactions in Arabic speaking countries. The main emphasis will continue to be on learning the basic structures of the language, reading &amp; writing simple texts and developing oral communication skills. Although students will begin to develop a useful knowledge of Arabic over the first year, the second year of Arabic is strongly recommended to those students desiring to acquire effective use of the language, and to students who need to fulfill the WCAS foreign language requirement.", "name": "Arabic I", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "111-3", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeThFr 9:00AM - 12:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/WCAS/ARABIC/111-3/40353", "instructor": ["Fadia M Antabli"], "id": "40353", "subject": "ARABIC"}]
