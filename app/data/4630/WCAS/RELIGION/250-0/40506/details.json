Students will learn how to approach major Islamic texts and understand the diverse legal, theological, philosophical, and literary contexts in which Muslims have interpreted and used them. We will focus heavily on primary sources?such as the Quran, sayings of the Prophet, fatwas, and theological debates?in order to provide students with an authoritative grasp of the discourses and practices that have shaped Islam into a diverse and globalized religion. We will emphasize these early formative moments and debates with an eye toward understanding contemporary issues of colonialism, Islamism, diaspora, as well as debates around gender, race, and pluralism. This course will provide an excellent introduction for students seeking a general overview of Islam as a religious tradition or more detailed future study in subjects such as Islamic law, Sufism, or the modern Muslim state."}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
