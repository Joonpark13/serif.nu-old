[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will be an introduction, suitable for beginners and others, to Buddhism, the philosophy and religion that began in India some 2500 years ago and now exists in almost all parts of the world. Buddhism has shaped the thought and culture of Asia and has also influenced Western thought and culture in significant ways. In this class we will examine some of the forms of this diverse tradition. One emphasis will be on investigating the philosophical and religious teachings of Gautama the Buddha in India as well as the history and thought of later Buddhists in other parts of Asia. We will explore Buddhism's system of values, its interpretation of existence, and its several systems of meditation and practices that the Buddhists have employed to find meaning in life.", "name": "Introduction to Buddhism", "section": "26", "location": "Harris Hall L28", "topic": "", "course": "210-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 6:30PM - 8:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/WCAS/RELIGION/210-0/40505", "instructor": ["George D Bond"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "40505", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
