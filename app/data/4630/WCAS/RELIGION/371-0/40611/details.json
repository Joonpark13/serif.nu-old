Class lectures and discussions will treat existentialism, atheism, and the quest for philosophical truth to be found in these filmic portrayals of everyday life. Weekly written film critiques, class discussion, and an in-class presentation will form the basis of your grade. No final paper/exam."}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
