[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Course Description:<br/><br/>What does it mean to be alone? How does our being together in the world shape us? In this course students will explore the ways in which our intuitive manner of perceiving, feeling, occupying, and understanding our world is determined in advance by the presence of others. We will reexamine the concepts of the self and of community through a consideration of the telling, retellings and adaptations of Robinson Crusoe from countries including Mexico, France, Korea, and South Africa. The isolation of Robinson Crusoe has repeatedly served as a lens through which to consider the nature and functions of human sociality. We will consider these questions from different cultural and historical perspectives, taking up issues of race, violence, gender, economics, and temporality.<br/><br/>This course will challenge students to intelligently and creatively analyze works of art, ground their arguments in relevant theoretical contexts, and to become effective writers capable of structuring and supporting compelling interpretations of artistic texts.", "name": "Studies in Theme", "section": "26", "topic": "A World Without Others: The Telling, Retellings an", "course": "304-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 1:00PM - 3:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/WCAS/COMP_LIT/304-0/40251", "instructor": [""], "id": "40251", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
