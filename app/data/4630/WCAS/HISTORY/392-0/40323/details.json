How can their works help us understand the African past? This course will explore how the most iconic works of modern African literature are informed by history. The novels we will read are all written by African authors, and in many cases are about a historical experience to which they were or are connected. These novels are a form of historical imagination about ?how it was' living in particular cities and regions of Africa and experiencing particular events in African history (such as the Rwandan genocide, apartheid in South Africa, or European colonial conquest). Although literature shares with history an attention to narrative and imagination, it departs from history in not being bound by evidence or fidelity to sources. We will explore how this is both the strengths and weakness of using literature to understand the past. How do fictional treatments of historical events differ as well as overlap with how historians understand the past?<br/><br/>No background in African history is required for the course."}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
