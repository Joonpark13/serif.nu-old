Today there are 2.3 million. This six-week seminar investigates how Americans have defined criminal behavior and shaped punishment practices. How did America begin the twentieth century as a nation with a small penal population and become a global outlier in mass incarceration one hundred years later? The class is organized chronologically, and draws on scholarly literature, court cases, investigative journalism, and prison memoirs. We will analyze how race, gender, and class operated in the criminal justice system and interacted with political objectives (e.g. order, authority, justice, freedom). By the end of the quarter, students will have a sophisticated understanding of how politics and culture influenced crime and punishment in America."}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
