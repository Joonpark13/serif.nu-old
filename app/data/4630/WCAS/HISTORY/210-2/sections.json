[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course probes major questions and themes in American history since the end of the Civil War. In particular, we will examine the ways in which the United States sought to define itself as a democratic society despite persistent conflicts around race and gender as well conflicting visions of national identity and citizenship. By focusing on the intersection between politics and culture through primary sources and secondary readings, students will learn to critically engage the forces of historical change that continue to shape our society and collective values today.", "name": "History of the United States, Reconstruction to the Present", "section": "26", "topic": "", "course": "210-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 10:00AM - 12:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/WCAS/HISTORY/210-2/40320", "instructor": ["Mariah Layne Hepworth"], "id": "40320", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
