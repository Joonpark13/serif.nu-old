In particular, we will examine the ways in which the United States sought to define itself as a democratic society despite persistent conflicts around race and gender as well conflicting visions of national identity and citizenship. By focusing on the intersection between politics and culture through primary sources and secondary readings, students will learn to critically engage the forces of historical change that continue to shape our society and collective values today."}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
