It will ask how a small island in northern Europe came to possess territory on six continents, with unquestioned dominance of the world's oceans. The course will grapple with narratives of colonization, resistance, collaboration and exchange, moving between the metropole and the colonies to examine those groups who gained from the empire and those who did not. It will ask how a liberal society justified the often brutal expansion of the empire abroad, and how all parties, Briton and non-Briton alike, understood and negotiated their place within it."}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
