[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course introduces students to the outlines of modern European history, from the French Revolution through the European Union Maastricht Treaty. Focusing on the multiple political organizations and reorganizations of Europe, this course traces the concept of the modern nation state, the widespread acceptance of this particular form of political organization, and the emergence of the European Union as a possible challenge to the nation state model. Students will also explore major social, cultural, economic, and technological changes of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, using both primary and secondary source material. This course will argue that the nation state is not an obvious or natural form of political organization, but was constructed during the 19th century and then challenged from opposing perspectives by fascism and communism in the 20th century, resulting in the emergence of the European Union as an attempt to ensure security through national integration.", "name": "European Civilization: Mid-18th C to Present", "section": "26", "topic": "", "course": "201-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 4:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/WCAS/HISTORY/201-2/40319", "instructor": ["Beth Anne Healey"], "id": "40319", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
