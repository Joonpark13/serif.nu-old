We will use this information to discuss various ways scholars have questioned the characterization of these changes as a cohesive &quot;revolution&quot; and the argument that science is best understood as a collection of conventions that are historically situated and contingent on other aspects of society, such as religion, politics, economics, and art."}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
