[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Scholars typically present the scientific developments of early modern Europe as the foundation of modern approaches to gathering knowledge about the world, hence the widespread use of the term &quot;Scientific Revolution.&quot; This course will examine the changes that took place in science and medicine during this period, including the use of experiments, the new role of images and art, studies of the new world, and the heavily-debated relationship between science and religion. We will use this information to discuss various ways scholars have questioned the characterization of these changes as a cohesive &quot;revolution&quot; and the argument that science is best understood as a collection of conventions that are historically situated and contingent on other aspects of society, such as religion, politics, economics, and art.", "name": "History of Western Science and Medicine: Origins in Early Mod Europe", "section": "26", "topic": "", "course": "275-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 10:00AM - 12:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/WCAS/HISTORY/275-1/40321", "instructor": ["Charlotte Elizabeth Cover Moy"], "id": "40321", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
