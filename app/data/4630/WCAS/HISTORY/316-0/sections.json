[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "\"Years of hope, days of rage.\" The Sixties remain one of the most studied and controversial time periods in United States history. Characterized by many as a time of Civil Rights, Free Speech, and the Sexual Revolution, this period also brought us the Vietnam War, the New Right, and the waning power of industrial unions. Moreover, historians continue to debate when the period known as \"the Sixties\" actually began and ended. Born out of a postwar period of expanding national expectation, the Sixties gave birth to our modern \"culture wars\" and continue to mean different things to all those who experienced or examine them. Through political, social, and cultural history, this course will explore the causes, content, and consequences of the period's many paradoxes. It will demonstrate how unresolved tensions in what scholars have called the \"liberal consensus\" in turn set the stage for the \"rise of the Right\" and \"Age of Reagan.\" Finally, we will evaluate why the history of this period remains so influential.", "name": "The Sixties", "section": "26", "location": "Harris Hall L28", "topic": "", "course": "316-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 10:00AM - 12:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/WCAS/HISTORY/316-0/40326", "instructor": ["Matthew Ross June"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "40326", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
