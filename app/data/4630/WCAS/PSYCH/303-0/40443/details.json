Despite a long history of studying psychological disorders, there is no clear consensus when it comes to answering these questions: Our understandings of what constitute psychological disorders and how to best treat them vary considerably across different time periods and cultures. It is fascinating to learn about the complexity in even defining psychological disorders. At the same time, it is also frustrating, especially in the face of real psychological distress that many experience: If we cannot agree on what psychological disorders are, then how are we to study them and treat them? In this course, we will begin exploring these questions through an introduction to the major categories of psychological disorders as we currently (and historically) understand them and through the integration of related research findings. In addition to focusing on the symptoms and causes of these disorders, we will learn about some major approaches to diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. Finally, special attention will be paid to current and/or controversial issues in abnormal psychology."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prereq: Psych 110."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Evaluation Method: 2 exams, 1 short paper."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Class Materials (Required): Butcher, J.
