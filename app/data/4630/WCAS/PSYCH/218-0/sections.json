[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "There are infinite ways in which a living system could represent and interact with its surroundings. Humans have converged upon a very specific set of representations and behaviors. In this course, students will learn how and why we conceptualize objects, events, and people in the ways we do. Moreover, they will discover how our capacities to represent, understand, and interact with various aspects of our world change over time as a function of intricate interactions between nature and nurture. Topics include biology and behavior, infancy, cognitive and social development, language and conceptual development, emotional and self development, the role of family and peers, and adolescence. While the course will cover human development from the moment of conception to old age, there will be an emphasis on early childhood. In addition to learning the methodologies and theoretical frameworks that developmental scientists use to understand the mind, students will be able to contextualize contemporary developmental psychology within millennia-old philosophical questions.", "name": "Developmental Psychology", "section": "26", "topic": "", "course": "218-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 1:00PM - 3:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/WCAS/PSYCH/218-0/40441", "instructor": ["Danielle Renae Perszyk"], "id": "40441", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
