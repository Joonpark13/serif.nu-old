[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What is the appeal of horrifying literature? From today's horror fiction exploring the limits of insanity and the paranormal back to its origins in Gothic tales featuring Indian captivity, frontier violence, and the terrors of slavery in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, American literature encodes a long history of fascination with the macabre. We will consider the aesthetic experience of terror along with the social and political function of works of dark fiction such as Charles Brockden Brown's Edgar Huntly, Edgar Allan Poe's &quot;The Murders of the Rue Morgue,&quot; Charles Chesnutt's The Conjure Woman, Henry James' The Turn of the Screw, and Tony Morrison's Beloved. We will examine the rise of the Gothic and the related genre of horror in relation to Enlightenment philosophical, scientific, and political thought along with the history of racialization and nationalism in the United States. Our readings will be supplemented by contemporary horror movies such as Alfred Hithcock's Psycho, Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.", "name": "Studies in Literature and Film", "section": "26", "topic": "American Horror", "course": "386-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 12:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/WCAS/ENGLISH/386-0/40268", "instructor": ["Eric Michael Hengstebeck"], "id": "40268", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
