[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Urbanologist Yi Fu Tuan writes, &quot;What begins as undifferentiated space becomes place when we get to know it better and endow it with values.&quot; In The Untouchables, Sean Connery tells Kevin Costner, &quot;You want to get Capone? Here's how you get Capone. He pulls a knife, you pull a gun. He puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one of his in the morgue. That's the Chicago way.&quot; In this class, we will examine &quot;the Chicago way&quot; from many different angles in order to interrogate the values with which various artists have endowed Chicago. We will read in a broad range of media: journalism, poetry, song, fiction, film, and sequential art to see how a sense of Chicago as a place works over time. We will pay close attention to depictions of the construction of American identity, and to the role of the artist and intellectual in the city.<br/><br/>Texts Include: Nelson Algren's Chicago: City on the Make and The Neon Wilderness; Richard Wright's Native Son; Stuart Dybek's The Coast of Chicago; journalism by Ben Hecht, Mike Royko and others; short fiction by Sandra Cisneros, James T.
