Somewhere in between is where most political protest occurs with demonstrations, grass root organizations, lobbying etc. But somewhere in this spectrum resides what I call &quot;Spectacular Protest&quot; by which I mean activities that use theatricality to ?capture' a moment leaving people to identify with the gesture of anti-establishment behavior. Examples may come from music (The Sex Pistols or Bob Dylan or Chance the Rapper), from art (Marcel Duchamp), from theater (Bertolt Brecht) or from new variations on political protest (the Yippies' nomination of a pig,?Pigasus' for President in 1968.)<br/>This class will be a discussion of these rather public and theatrical moments of protest and how they galvanize public space, even if for a brief moment of time. The more ambitious aspect of this class is to determine whether these moments of protest can rise above juvenilia or immature spectacle and result in social change. In other words, should we even call them &quot;political&quot;?<br/>The examples we will cover in the brief time we have are (briefly) the Dada movement after World War One, the Situationist Movement in the 1960s (with their reinvention of Marx to explain the commodity in advanced capitalism), 1968 both in Paris (&quot;Be Realistic, Demand the Impossible&quot;) and Chicago (&quot;Stop the War in Vietnam) and lastly, &quot;The Sex Pistols&quot; and Punk."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "There will be a take-home midterm (25%), a short paper on one of the books (25%), and a take home final (50%)."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Readings:<br/><br/>Greil Marcus: &quot;Lipstick Traces&quot; (to be purchased)<br/>Guy Debord: &quot;Society of the Spectacle&quot; (on line)<br/>David Farber: &quot;Chicago'68&quot; to be purchased<br/><br/>Articles on line or in a course pack."}], "lmod": "5/1/16 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
