The teaching method consists of the presentation of the artistic and scholarly texts; guidance through the multimedia learning resources connected to the material; classroom question and discussion; ongoing assessment and feedback on individual contributions to collaborative LMS-based projects; and a revisable draft process for the midterm and final compositions. Since a major goal of the course is the development of practical analytic strategies, part of that process involves composing a number of brief writing assignments: graded and ungraded short essays, some done in class, some submitted as homework. Three longer (roughly 5 to 10 page) interpretive studies are required: a wiki contribution posted to to the course's Canvas site as a collaborative project, and two traditional-style research and presentation compositions, one due at midterm and the other in the last week of classes. There is no final examination."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Wiki Project: In examining the oral performance genre of &quot;lyric&quot; (for course purposes, a generic term for all types of spoken and sung poetry) each participant will choose one of the 210 verses which make up the Yoruba divination system known as Sixteen Cowries.
