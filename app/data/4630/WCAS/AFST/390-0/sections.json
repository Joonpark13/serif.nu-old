[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "AFST 390-0 Special Topics: Anthropology of African Civil Wars (Combined with ANTHRO 390-0-20)<br/><br/>Understanding civil war is a central intellectual (and political) challenge of the contemporary global world, involving insistent questions about terrorism, genocide, child soldiers, sexual violence, etc. This course examines a variety of cases of contemporary African civil wars but is framed by general questions about the logic of violence in any social context. The course focuses on: (a) the micro-practices of violence in the daily organization of civil war, especially the language and ideology of violence invoked in those social practices, and (b) the relationship between everyday social practices of violence and macro-level structural forces of politics and economics. Readings are mainly from anthropology but other social sciences that use ethnographic methods to study civil war will be discussed.", "name": "Topics in African Studies", "section": "20", "topic": "Anthropology of African Civil Wars", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 6:30PM - 9:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4630/WCAS/AFST/390-0/40052", "instructor": ["William P Murphy"], "id": "40052", "subject": "AFST"}]
