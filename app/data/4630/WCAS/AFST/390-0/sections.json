The course focuses on: (a) the micro-practices of violence in the daily organization of civil war, especially the language and ideology of violence invoked in those social practices, and (b) the relationship between everyday social practices of violence and macro-level structural forces of politics and economics.

Students will present and discuss their problem sets in class. The final is a take-home term paper of 8 - 10 double-spaced pages. The final paper will allow students to relate key analytical themes of the course to the documentation of civil war and child soldiers in the novel and film called &quot;Beasts on No Nation.&quot; The four short papers are each worth 10 points of the grade, and the final paper is worth 50 points.
