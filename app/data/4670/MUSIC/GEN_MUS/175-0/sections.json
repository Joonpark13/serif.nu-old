Beginning with historical festivals, such as Woodstock, Altamont, and the Newport Jazz/Folk Festivals, we will build on these events with a look toward the Chicago music festival scene - ranging from large paid festivals (e.g., Lollapolooza) to free neighborhood festivals (e.g., Grant Park Music Festival, Jazz Fest, or even Evanston's Summer Dance). How do we participate in the festival as a temporal music experience? How have increased costs and capital ventures changed the dialogue surrounding music festivals in the last 50 years? How do musicians and audiences experience festivals differently? The class will comprise lectures, readings, and discussion, as well as actual attendance, observation, and participation at local music festvals during the class term.", "qtr": "Summer 2017", "name": "Selected Topics in Music Literature for Non-Majors", "title": "MUSIC GEN_MUS 175-0-20 Selected Topics in Music Literature for Non-Majors", "lmod": "4/20/17 6:30 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Rachel Joy Tollett", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "Music Festivals from Woodstock to Lollapalooza", "course": "175-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Examining the social and musical place of historical and contemporary music festivals, this course asks questions about cultural place and musical performance.
