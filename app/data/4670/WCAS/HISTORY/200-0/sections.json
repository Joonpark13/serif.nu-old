The main goals of this course are to introduce students to the history of Latina/o's civic and political activism and to trace the development of immigrant rights activism in the twentieth century. This course analyzes Latina/o stories ranging from immigrant workers to the experiences of temporary guest workers, such as Braceros; it evaluates various Latino interest and civil groups, as well as new forms of activism like the Dreamers' campaigns. It also places immigrant rights activism in the context of other social and civil rights movements in the United States. To this purpose, it considers, Latinas/os' struggles for inclusion, such as bilingual education, fair labor practices for immigrant workers, equal opportunities, and immigration reform. While focused on the migration stories, these often overlap with legal and political history in the United States. By exploring this interplay between the law and migration we can relate local and regional stories to national policies and federal immigration legislation, which have shaped Latino migration politics.
