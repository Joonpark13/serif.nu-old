From the rise of factories in the early 19th century to the space program in the 1960s to today's world of handheld devices and social media, generation after generation has witnessed innovations that seem to shake the world. But has technology driven change in American society, or have the characteristics, politics, laws, and beliefs of American society driven technological change? In this course, we will explore these questions by examining key technologies through the ages, from the steam engine to the smartphone, and we will explore where these objects came from and how society has absorbed and debated them. We will analyze, through lectures and discussions, what technology has brought to bear on questions of progress, nationalism, capitalism, environmentalism, and feminism, and will learn how these ideas have taken different forms through time ? including our own. We will explore how the society we live in today has been shaped by the technological debates of the past, and, in light of today's globalized and interconnected world, pose a fundamental question: can technologies truly be \"national\" in character?", "qtr": "Summer 2017", "name": "History of American Technology", "title": "WCAS HISTORY 325-0-26 History of American Technology", "lmod": "4/20/17 6:32 PM (CT)", "section": "26", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Michael Alan Falcone", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "325-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Since the early days of the republic, Americans have marveled at the rapid pace of technological change around them, and have grappled with how to understand and define themselves in the face of a seemingly unending array of life-altering technological developments.
