The course is organized around two central theoretical problems: (1) the relationship between the micro-level patterns of violence in a civil war and the macro-level causes of the war, and (2) the patron-client networks that shape the institutions and organizations of civil war in Africa. Readings will emphasize ethnographic methods for addressing these theoretical issues. No prerequisites required.
