Ethnographies are long-term, intimate studies of a community or a group - at their best, they are as gripping as a good novel or a movie, but based in fact, not fiction. This methodology was developed by cultural anthropologists and is used widely today in consumer research, education, sociology, and medicine. In this course, we will read some good ethnographies, watch classic documentaries and even listen to music on a wide variety of interesting topics including race, sex, and gender; food, family, illness and wellness; and whatever else ethnographers are looking at these days. The case studies will include examples from the U.S. as well as Latin America and the world. Grading will be based on class participation and two essay exams.", "qtr": "Summer 2017", "name": "Culture & Society", "title": "WCAS ANTHRO 211-0-26 Culture &amp; Society", "lmod": "4/20/17 6:30 PM (CT)", "section": "26", "topic": "", "course": "211-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course is a basic introduction to cultural anthropology, and especially to ethnography: the core research tool of the qualitative social sciences.
