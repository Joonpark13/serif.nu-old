The study of human origins, or paleoanthropology, is a subfield of physical anthropology that focuses on the biological history of the human species including their evolution, emergence and radiation. We will explore the scientific method and how theories like evolution have come about and expanded over time. We will learn about our closest living relatives - primates - and how an appreciation of their life history and behavior reflect the modern human condition. Many of the principles and concepts that comprise our understanding of how humans have evolved and adapted over time involve an appreciation of ecology, genetics, physiology, adaptation and cultural development that will also be explored. Lastly we will look at modern human diversity and discuss how we are continuing to evolve today.", "qtr": "Summer 2017", "name": "Human Origins", "title": "WCAS ANTHRO 213-0-26 Human Origins", "lmod": "4/20/17 6:31 PM (CT)", "section": "26", "topic": "", "course": "213-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Anthropology is a holistic analysis of the human condition.
