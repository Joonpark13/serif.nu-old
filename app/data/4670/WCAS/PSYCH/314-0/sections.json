This seminar will instead focus upon the questions asked within the growing science of positive psychology. What is happiness? Can happiness be learned, or is our happiness \"setpoint\" mostly determined by genetics? Do we know ourselves well enough to know what makes us happy, and if not, why not? Does money make us happy? Relationships? Religion? How do people create a sense of meaning in their lives? What types of situations encourage cognitive mastery and creativity? How do we, as a society, encourage generosity and altruism? In this seminar, students will read a mix of recent scientific journal articles and books, will write opinion papers about the scientific findigns, and will journal about their own experiences in trying to apply these findings to their own lives, using weekly well-being exercises. Students can expect to wrestle with some of the \"big questions\" about what makes a good life and a strong scoiety in discussions with their classmates.", "qtr": "Summer 2017", "name": "Special Topics in Psychology", "title": "WCAS PSYCH 314-0-35 Special Topics in Psychology", "lmod": "4/20/17 6:33 PM (CT)", "section": "35", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-4972", "instructor_name": "Wendi L Gardner", "instructor_addr": "Swift Hall 203"}], "topic": "Positive Psychology- The Science of Well-Being", "course": "314-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Psychology has traditionally focused on understanding mental illness, ra rather than factor that lead to optimal mental well-being.

Furthermore, how confident are we that our treatments are helping? In some cases, is treatment even necessary? For many years, these kinds of questions have captivated the field of clinical psychology, which is dedicated to the study of mental disorders and their treatment. In this seminar, we will explore several important controversies throughout the history of clinical psychology that have sparked intense debate about what constitutes a mental disorder and what, if anything, should be considered for treatment. We will examine, for example, the controversies related to the effectiveness of psychiatric medication, the origins of dissociative identity disorder (formerly multiple personality disorder), the outcomes of child sexual abuse, and the classification of gender dysphoria and transsexualism. Some of these controversies continue to divide the field today. In our discussion and critical analysis of these scientific controversies, we will integrate both the theoretical and empirical psychological literature. By reading, discussing, and writing about scientific controversies in clinical psychology, you will develop the ability to critically evaluate the validity of psychological claims and effectively articulate and support your own claims. Additionally, we will undertake some parts of scientific research ourselves: formulating hypotheses, designing and running studies to test them, and working with and interpreting data.
