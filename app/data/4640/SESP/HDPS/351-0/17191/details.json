But what is an emotion? What happens in our bodies and our brains when an emotion is triggered? How can emotions help us live productive, connected, healthy, and long lives? And can we ever truly understand what somebody else is feeling? These are some of the mysteries that we will seek to unravel in this course. We will read literature from Darwin to the latest scientific studies, combine lectures and small-group discussions, conduct research experiments, and engage in peer review and online collaboration."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:52 PM (CT)", "subject": "HDPS"}]
