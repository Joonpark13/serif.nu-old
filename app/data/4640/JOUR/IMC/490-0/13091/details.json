Each student may aspire to a different position, but all will develop leadership skills. Some students may want to lead marketing departments and others may want to lead companies, non-profits or government agencies. Some will work in global enterprises and others will have local customers. A few may become entrepreneurs. Many of the attributes of leadership and good management are applicable across industry and sector. First, the course looks at how students inspire others, a central aspect of leadership. How does each student communicate verbally and effectively to others? Then the course looks at organizational development, the skills students need to run organizations, and how to manage innovation. Students use readings, role-playing, and discussion to improve their experience with managing and overseeing talent, organization, economics and finance, accountability and business planning. So, the course begins with a student view of the organization and finishes with thought leadership and business planning for growth. Students will be expected to participate in class and make oral presentations. Students should view this course as an opportunity to grow as communicators within an organization. Students who complete this course will communicate ideas orally in presentations; become self-aware of areas of development; participate effectively in organizations as an employee, manager, team member, leader; explore and engage in economics, finance and management literacy; and create and evaluate growth plans for businesses."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "IMC"}]
