The course focuses on understanding how individuals, families, and groups acquire, consume, and dispose of goods, services, ideas, brands, and experiences. The goal is to deeply understand people's goals, what people actually do, the meanings behind their activities, and the experiences they seek in order to better understand them as consumers. To do this, we will examine psychological, economic, communications, anthropological and sociological perspectives on human action that will allow us to generate consumer insights. Knowledge of consumer behavior is essential for key strategic tasks including environmental analyses, product positioning, branding, segmentation, and the implementation of integrated and effective communications strategies. The purpose of this course is to introduce, discuss, understand, and analyze consumers' lives to provide students the building blocks for developing consumer centric and value oriented products, experiences, and brand communications as part of an effective IMC program. Specifically, this course will focus on the following conceptual building blocks: Background on Consumer Insights Psychological Aspects of Consumer Behavior Social Aspects of Consumer Behavior Aspects of Consumer Behavior in Action Methodological Tools for Consumer Understanding."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "IMC"}]
