Just as politics represents the inner workings of democracy, the best political reporting exposes and explains those workings and, on a good day, rescues the republic from folly. Journalists must be professionally skeptical, rigorous, and fair. Their audience? Voters. The stakes? The direction of the country. To make sense of Campaign 2016's rolling carnival of fact, fiction and shifting narrative, the class will study campaign speeches and film documentaries; opinion polls and advertising; political commentary and candidate profiles. An essential part of our effort will be focused on understanding not just how journalists see the political world, but how candidates and campaign operatives see and use the media, and how voters respond. We will devote an October weekend to a reporting trip, taking a close look at campaign operations and listening to voters."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
