The goal is for students to get the kinds of hands-on experience that help them develop new skills, do deep research, build confidence in their capabilities and learn how innovative companies and products become successful. Our goal will be to match graduate students with sites that offer the kinds of opportunities they need to enhance their skills, versatility and marketability. Students will be expected to fill out a weekly log, receive at least one visit from Medill faculty during the quarter and share their experiences and lessons learned with other students participating in practicums."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
