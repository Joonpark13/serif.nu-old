We visit laboratories at local universities, talk to climate researchers and read journalism and specialized publications about science.<br/><br/>Course requirements include writing a book review of a science/technology/environment/medicine work, analyzing media coverage of a particular scientific issue and completing a practicum - fieldwork in a lab, clinic or other scientific setting. Students have traveled to marine biology labs from Maine to Hawaii, observed stars and planets at an observatory in Texas, and shadowed surgeons and veterinarians in the Chicago area. Because science is vast, and you all have different interests, assignments may be satisfied with work in areas of your choice, including medicine, the environment, technology, physics, nano-science.<br/><br/>From time to time, we have been able to contribute to online publications popsci.com, popularmechanics.com and outsideonline.com."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "MSJ Program Only; prerequisites: Journalism Methods."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
