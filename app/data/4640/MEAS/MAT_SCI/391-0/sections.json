[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "As a materials scientist/engineer, you may be asked to design or improve a material to address a specific need. How are you going to produce it, achieve the expected properties, and do so economically and safely? Which processing variables are going to be the most important in affecting properties and therefore must be controlled carefully, and which are less important and require less stringent (and less costly) control? These questions are the subjects to be considered in this course. We will discuss efficient design of experiments, including full and fractional factorials, to determine the most important processing variables, and methods to reach optimum properties with least sensitivity to such variables. Multiple property optimization to find the best trade-offs of properties, cost, etc will be discussed. Several lectures in statistics will be given at the beginning of the course to equip everyone with sufficient statistics background to benefit from this course.<br/><br/>Relationship to Department Objectives<br/>Supports 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16Laboratory project<br/>Teams of 2-3 students<br/>Emphasis on design and analysis of experiments", "name": "Process Design", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute L251", "topic": "", "course": "391-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 3:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MEAS/MAT_SCI/391-0/13252", "instructor": ["Yip-Wah   Chung"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "13252", "subject": "MAT_SCI"}]
