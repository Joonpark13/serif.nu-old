[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "MAT SCI 332 This course will provide the students with an in-depth study of plastic deformation and fracture of materials, with emphasis on structure/properties relations. The role of imperfections, state of stress, temperature and strain rate upon mechanical behavior, is examined.<br/><br/>Teams consisting of about 4 students will carry out a project designed to simulate an industrial or university R&amp;D investigation. Materials will be subjected to microstructural and mechanical tests from which an application will be evaluated. Each team will present an oral and a written report at the end of the quarter.<br/><br/>Relationship to Department Objectives<br/>Supports 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 15, 16", "name": "Mechanical Behavior of Solids", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "332-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MEAS/MAT_SCI/332-0/13249", "instructor": ["Kenneth R.
