[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "This course provides an overview of quantum mechanics from a materials science perspective. Exact solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation will be derived including one-dimensional potential energy wells and barriers, three-dimensional spherically symmetric potentials, and periodic potentials. In addition, approximation methods will be implemented such as the variational principle and perturbation theory.", "name": "Advanced Physics of Materials", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "451-0", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MEAS/MAT_SCI/451-0/13328", "instructor": ["Mark   Hersam"], "id": "13328", "subject": "MAT_SCI"}]
