Resistors and dashpots dissipate energy. Springs, masses, capacitors, and inductors store energy but do not generate it or dissipate it. Still other components such as gears, levers and motors convert energy from one form to another. In this course you will learn how complex engineering systems can be described in terms of small number of basic energetic components. ME 390 considers especially the dynamic behavior of engineering systems, including descriptors such as time constants, natural frequency and damping ratio, and frequency response.</p><br/><br/>Minisyllabus:<br/><br/>Models, dynamics, simulation<br/><br/>Bond graphing<br/><br/>Energy storages, Energy sources<br/><br/>Laplace Transforms<br/><br/>First and Second order response<br/><br/>Bode plots"}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MEAS/MECH_ENG/390-0/13587", "instructor": ["James Edward   Colgate"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "13587", "subject": "MECH_ENG"}]
