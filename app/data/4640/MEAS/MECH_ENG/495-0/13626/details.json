This new course focuses on the mechanics of representative processes in the three fundamental processing categories: sheet metal forming in deformation-based processes, cutting in subtractive processes, and laser-engineered net shaping (LENS) in additive processes. The course discusses current theoretical and experimental advances in both fundamental process mechanics and technology advances and future developments.<br/><br/>The theoretical topics will revolve around:<br/><br/> (1) Material constitutive models under large plastic deformation<br/> (2) Material characterization methods<br/> (3) Process modeling<br/> (4) Static and dynamic instability analysis<br/> (5) Damage models<br/> (6) Material microstructure evolution <br/><br/>On the pragmatic side, in addition to an overview of current practices, issues related to emerging technologies will be discussed with a particular focus on:<br/><br/> (1) Flexible forming<br/> (2) Precision machining<br/> (3) Rapid prototyping"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "CEE 417: Mechanics of Continua I or equivalent."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "MECH_ENG"}]
