These deficiencies are the result of two factors, difficulties in algorithmic control of these swarms, and limitations in hardware capabilities of the individuals. This class surveys the state of the art research that addresses these deficiencies. Coursework includes reading research papers, student presentations and discussion of select papers, and a final project implementing studied topics in a real or simulated robot swarm."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites: Proficiency in programming (C language preferred), experience with robotics."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "MECH_ENG"}]
