Focus will be on both hardware (sensors and actuators) and software (sensor processing and behavior development). Topics will include: the basics in kinematics, dynamics, control, and motion planning; and an introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Formerly EECS 295.<br/><br/>Open-loop control, with different types of hardware/motion (mobility, manipulation); Closed-loop control and sensor processing, with different types of sensors; Reactive control, behavior-based robotics, reasoning about uncertainty; Basics in AI and ML, with simple learning techniques.<br/><br/>Coursework will consist primarily of laboratory assignments, that include (some) hardware construction and (more) software development. Laboratory work will be done in groups of 2-3 students. Each lab assignment will be demoed and written up as a report (individually).", "name": "Special Topics in Mechanical Engineering", "section": "2", "location": "Tech Institute CG50 - EECS T-L", "topic": "Introduction to Robotics Laboratory", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 6:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MEAS/MECH_ENG/395-0/17387", "instructor": ["Brenna Dee Argall"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "17387", "subject": "MECH_ENG"}]
