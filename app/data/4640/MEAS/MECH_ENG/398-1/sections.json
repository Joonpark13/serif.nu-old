[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "Product or system design projects carried out by small student groups. Project definition, conceptual and detailed design, evaluation, and documentation.<br/><br/>WHO TAKES IT<br/>Nobel Prize winner Herbert Simon said, \"Science is the study of what is. Engineering is the creation of what is to be.\" The essence of engineering is design. Most engineers work on some sort of product development, whether it be creating new products or making better products, all based on a fairly well-defined design process. In ME 398, student teams create a new product for an outside client using this design process. Undergraduates take this course in their fourth year, after having mastered many of the engineering tools that they will use in their careers. Mechanical engineering students are required to take either this course or ME 340-2 to fulfill their design requirement. Two former students in this course went on to win the iF Product Design Award in an international design competition based in Germany for their design of the Swingline Worx Mini Stapler in 2000.", "name": "Engineering Design - Senior Capstone, Quarter 1", "section": "1", "location": "Ford Eng Design Cntr ITW 1350", "topic": "", "course": "398-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MEAS/MECH_ENG/398-1/13704", "instructor": ["David W Gatchell", "Michael Joseph Beltran"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "13704", "subject": "MECH_ENG"}]
