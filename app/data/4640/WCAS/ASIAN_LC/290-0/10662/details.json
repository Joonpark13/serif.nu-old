In addition to providing a survey of major works of modern Korean literature, this course will examine the significance and role of literature in Korean society. We will explore questions such as: How have the social and historical contexts of this period - from Japanese colonialism to Korean War and national division to rule by Cold War era authoritarian governments - shaped Korean literature? Why have so many Korean writers asked, &quot;What is literature?&quot; How have they attempted to answer this question? The readings for the course will include works of literary fiction and criticism, as well as historical and/or critical readings, which will be used to supplement and contextualize the literary texts. All readings will be in English. No previous knowledge of Korea or Korean language is required."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "This course is designed to introduce students to the history and major works of modern Korean literature through literary texts in English translations.
