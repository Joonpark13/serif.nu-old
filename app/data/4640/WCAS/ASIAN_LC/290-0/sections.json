In addition to providing a survey of major works of modern Korean literature, this course will examine the significance and role of literature in Korean society. We will explore questions such as: How have the social and historical contexts of this period - from Japanese colonialism to Korean War and national division to rule by Cold War era authoritarian governments - shaped Korean literature? Why have so many Korean writers asked, &quot;What is literature?&quot; How have they attempted to answer this question? The readings for the course will include works of literary fiction and criticism, as well as historical and/or critical readings, which will be used to supplement and contextualize the literary texts. All readings will be in English.

In the millennium that followed, the Western Wing story was reincarnated as musical performance, Yuan zaju drama, Ming chuanqi theater, and an oft-repeated motif of painting, illustration, and material culture. In this discussion-based seminar, we will look in depth at its most famous version, the Yuan zaju by Wang Shifu, as well as one of its precursors, the zhugongdiao (all-keys-and-modes) by Dong Jieyuan. We will also examine secondary literature on other reproductions of the Western Wing story, including its depictions in art, in order to consider issues such as representations of femininity, feminine desire, and the cult of qing; cultures of reading; intertextual practices; dramatic codes; and visual regimes in drama and in art. Throughout, we will be guided by questions of how the worlds of the Western Wing are constructed, deconstructed and reconstructed for the pleasures of the different ages.", "name": "Introductory Topics in Asian Languages and Cultures", "section": "23", "topic": "Romance, Reproduced, Reinvented", "course": "290-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ASIAN_LC/290-0/10665", "instructor": ["Anne Elizabeth Rebull"], "id": "10665", "subject": "ASIAN_LC"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course focuses on the profound impact of 19th-Century Russian literature on early 20th-Century Chinese writers. It explores the ways Russian literature informed and inspired the social opinions, cultural arguments and artistic practices of major Chinese writers within the social-historical context of early 20th-Century China. Through a comparative study of texts in different genres - short story, novel, drama, etc. - we shall consider such questions as: How did Russian literature become the dominant source of influence and enlightenment for Chinese intelligentsia? What did the Chinese writers, driven by the need to practice a new literature that would serve as a &quot;cure for society&quot;, strive to find in their dialogue with the Russian writers? How did Chinese writers incorporate the themes and styles of their Russian predecessors into a different cultural tradition? These questions will allow us to fully understand the history and mechanism of this dialogue across cultures and centuries, and see how literature plays its pivotal role in the life of two nations.", "name": "Introductory Topics in Asian Languages and Cultures", "section": "24", "topic": "Influence of Russian Lit. on Chinese Writers", "course": "290-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ASIAN_LC/290-0/17667", "instructor": ["Hui   Zhang"], "id": "17667", "subject": "ASIAN_LC"}]
