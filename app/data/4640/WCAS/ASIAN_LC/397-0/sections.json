This course offers intensive training in research methods in Asian languages, where students will strengthen the skills necessary to develop and complete a ten-week paper, which can then serve as the basis for a longer a project. Each week, we will focus on a specific component of the research process: how to convert an area of interest into a specific topic, how to write an abstract, how to apply for funding, how to compile a bibliography, etc. These exercises will culminate in a research paper that draws on sources in the original language. Students will work closely with an advisor outside of the course to locate resources relevant to their paper topics and in their specified field and language of study. In addition to the research-specific assignments, we will examine throughout the quarter how we can critique or change existing methods for producing knowledge about Asia. We will consider how approaches to Asia can produce the \"Orient\" as an object of knowledge and how power relations are exercised in that production of knowledge and place; how different media are used to distribute \"hard\" and \"soft\" power; how the production of knowledge and culture supports colonialism and imperialism; and how knowledge and culture can be decolonized or democratized.", "qtr": "Fall 2016", "name": "Senior Seminar", "title": "WCAS ASIAN_LC 397-0-20 Senior Seminar", "lmod": "10/30/16 6:58 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/467-0283", "instructor_name": "Patrick James Noonan", "instructor_addr": "1880 Campus Drive, Kresge Hall, Office 4-550"}], "topic": "Approaches to Asia", "course": "397-0", "enrl_requirement": "<br/>Add Consent: Instructor Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Topic: Approaches to Asia.
