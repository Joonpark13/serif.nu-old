[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Topic: Reading and Writing Desire: Love, Courtship, and Gender in Premodern Japanese Literature. Early Japanese literature is often associated with the themes of love and amorous longing, but what do we talk about when we talk about love? What kinds of desires?emotional, sexual, social, political?are set into play by narratives of courtship, and how are these marked by gender? And what roles can literature play in mediating and articulating those desires? With these questions in mind, this course offers a topical survey of the major works, genres, and authors of premodern Japanese literature, from the earliest times through the medieval period: early mythohistory, classical poetry, poetic diaries and poem tales, narrative tales of the Heian court (including the classic Tale of Genji), Buddhist folklore, the n? theater, and more. Topics addressed include: court politics and the politics of courtship; tensions between public obligation and private feeling; gendered gazes and the optics of desire; the social functions of poetic exchange in courtship practices; the role of nature imagery in lyrical expression; the gendering of genre and language, and the performative use of both to invert those constructions; Buddhist conceptions of desire, gender, and love as both damnation and salvation; social status, class, mobility, and the erotics of inter-class romance. All readings are in English; no knowledge of Japanese is required or expected.", "name": "Advanced Topics in Asian Languages and Cultures", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-425", "topic": "Reading and Writing Desire: Love, Courtship, and G", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ASIAN_LC/390-0/10666", "instructor": ["Thomas Martin Gaubatz"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "10666", "subject": "ASIAN_LC"}]
