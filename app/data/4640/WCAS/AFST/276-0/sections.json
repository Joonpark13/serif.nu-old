[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "AFST 276-0-20 &quot;African Literature in Translation &quot; , Fall 2016, Richard Lepine <br/><br/>The course is primarily a survey of African oral verbal arts traditions, with an additional focus on the links between these traditions and African films. The original works of art, the objects of study in the course, are not literature in the strict sense of the term-verbal art in the medium of writing-but rather take form in oral performance or electronic media like film, TV, radio, recorded disks, and web-based digital media. However, as printed texts in English translation, the course examples from various genres of African oral verbal arts performances (riddles, lyric poetry, proverbs, praise poetry, folktales, trickster tales, hero tales, epics) are all experienced as literature for purposes of analysis and interpretation. A primary focus of the course is exploring the analytic approaches employed by scholars Harold Scheub and Robert Cancel, specialists in African oral traditions and their relationships with other arts media. In addition to printed materials, course members will have in common the experience of viewing four African films: &quot;Wend Kuuni&quot; (1982; Gaston Kabor\u00e9, dir.; Burkina Faso), &quot;Keita: Heritage of the Griot&quot; (1995; Dani Kouyat\u00e9, dir.; Burkina Faso); &quot;La vie est belle/Life Is Rosy&quot; (1987; Ngangura Mweze and Bernard Lamy, dirs.; Za\u00efre [Democratic Republic of Congo]), and &quot;Yeelen&quot; (Souleymane Ciss\u00e9, Mali, 1987, 105 min.).", "name": "African Literature in Translation", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "276-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/AFST/276-0/17370", "instructor": ["Richard Marshall   Lepine"], "id": "17370", "subject": "AFST"}]
