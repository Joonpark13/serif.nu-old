Become adept at reading and critically evaluating primary literature and reviews.<br/>3). Develop an ability to generalize neurobiological principles and mechanisms across systems.<br/>4). Develop novel hypotheses on topics in the area of neurobiology of animal behavior and learn to align them with experimental approaches that can be used to test the proposed ideas."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Hybrid of lecture and in-class discussion.
