In this course, we will explore the ideological content of various strains of American conservatisms as a way of exploring what ideology itself is and how it operates in communities of color. To do this, we will read texts in the \"conservative tradition,\" compare them to texts and events produced by minority conservatives, and discuss their relationship with the racial justice tradition of ethnic studies, especially (but not limited to) Asian American studies. In the first part of the course, we will read Allan Bloom's Closing of the American Mind in relation to student activist movements since the 1960s, the communities that they created, and the minority conservatives who challenged them. In the second half, we will read Edmund Burke's Reflections on the French Revolution to compare \"the conservative tradition\" with contemporary articulations of minority conservatism. We will also spend some time on the stereotype of the \"model minority,\" which is why this course will be of special interest to those in Asian American studies.
