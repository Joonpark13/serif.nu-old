[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What is Asian American advertising, how can we understand cultural production and consumption practices among Asian Americans? This course will examine ethnographic approaches to advertising, fashion, food, and expressive culture among Asian communities in the United States. The first portion of the class will examine the creative and production processes involved in creating ads for specific Asian ethnic groups, as well as other cultural production in Asian American industries, including fashion. The second will look in depth at various studies of consumption that document the ways in which Asian Americans engage with popular culture and commodities, including food and art. The course will also draw relevant connections between advertising and consumption in the US with China, India, Japan, and other Asian nation-states. The course will be grounded in anthropological perspectives of advertising and cultural production as well as theories of consumption, and consider the effects of these on meanings of ethnicity, race, gender, class, nation, and diaspora.", "name": "Advanced Topics in Social and Cultural Analysis", "section": "1", "topic": "Asian Persuasion: Advertising &amp; Consumption", "course": "303-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ASIAN_AM/303-0/10626", "instructor": ["Shalini   Shankar"], "id": "10626", "subject": "ASIAN_AM"}]
