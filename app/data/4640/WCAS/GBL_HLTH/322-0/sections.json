[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This upper-level seminar in medical anthropology examines the role of social markers of difference including race, class, nationality, gender, sexuality, age and religion in current debates and challenges in the theory and practice of global health. We will explore contemporary illness experiences and therapeutic interventions in sociocultural and historical context through case studies from the US, Brazil, and South Africa. Students will be introduced to key concepts such as embodiment, medicalization, structural violence, the social determinants of health, and biopolitics. Central questions of the seminar include: How do social categories of difference determine disease and health in individuals and collectivities? How is medical science influenced by economic and political institutions and by patient mobilization? How does social and economic inclusion/exclusion govern access to treatment as well as care of the self and others? The course will provide advanced instruction in anthropological and related social scientific research methods as they apply to questions of social inequality and public health policy in both the United States and in emerging economic powers. The course draws from historical accounts, contemporary ethnographies, public health literature, media reports, and films.", "name": "The Social Determinants of Health", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "322-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 1:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/GBL_HLTH/322-0/17553", "instructor": ["Peter Andrew Locke"], "id": "17553", "subject": "GBL_HLTH"}]
