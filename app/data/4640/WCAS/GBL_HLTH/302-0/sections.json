[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Global health is a popular field of work and study for Americans, with an increasing number of medical trainees and practitioners, as well as people without medical training, going abroad to volunteer in areas where there are few health care practitioners. In addition, college undergraduates, as well as medical trainees and practitioners, are going abroad in increasing numbers to conduct research in areas with few health care resources. But all of these endeavors, though entered into with the best of intentions, are beset with ethical questions, concerns, and dilemmas. In this course, students will assess these ethical challenges, and be provided with some tools in order to ethically analyze global health practices. In so doing, students will examine core ethical codes, guidelines, and principals - such as solidarity and social justice - so they will be able to ethically assess global health practices in a way that places an emphasis on the core goal of global health: reducing health inequity.", "name": "Global Bioethics", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "302-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/GBL_HLTH/302-0/12284", "instructor": ["Sarah B Rodriguez"], "id": "12284", "subject": "GBL_HLTH"}]
