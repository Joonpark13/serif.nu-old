More than a simple background for the narrative to unfold, cities such as Napoli, Roma, and Milano have played a crucial role as active sites of love, labor, crime, and revolt. We will focus on films and novels that shed light on crucial periods of postwar Italian history (the economic miracle, the years of lead, the 1980s backlash, up to the contemporary period) and ask questions about architecture, urban planning, life rhythms, consumerism, and spectacle. Films will include: Roberto Rossellini's Voyage to Italy (1954), Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1960), Pier Paolo Pasolini's Mamma Roma (1962), Nanni Moretti's Caro Diario (1993), Matteo Garrone's Gomorra (2008), and Paolo Sorrentino's La grande bellezza (2013). We will also read texts by Elena Ferrante, Erri De Luca, Giovanni Testori, and Roberto Saviano, among others."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:07 PM (CT)", "subject": "ITALIAN"}]
