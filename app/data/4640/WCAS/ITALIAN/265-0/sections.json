[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The idea that each of us has a body and a soul, and that the two are somehow separate entities, goes back to the origins of Western culture and history. This course studies the comprehension of the human body and soul in Italy from Augustan Rome to the early Renaissance. We will examine the body and soul in Rome by focusing on Ovid's Metamorphoses, then turn to Christianity's radical reconfiguration of the body and soul in the letters of Saint Paul and Gnostic writings, and finally arrive at the threshold of the modern world, exploring medieval saints and Boccaccio's Decameron.
