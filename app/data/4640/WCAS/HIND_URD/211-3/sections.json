[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Too often students complain that they do not get enough practice speaking the language that they are learning. This course will focus mainly on sustaining conversations in Hindi on various topics ranging from gossip to politics. There will be some reading, but very little writing done. Each topic will be introduced either through a short written passage, or through a video or audio clip. After introducing the basic vocabulary, phrases and expressions necessary for talking about that topic, the students will be given a situation in which they find themselves, and create an impromptu conversation that fits the situation (and the topic).<br/><br/>Topics covered in class:<br/><br/>a. Extended small talk (talking to strangers as well as acquaintances about daily life, problems, weather, etc). <br/>b. Health and Medicine (asking about health, the ability to tell one's health problems/symptoms to a doctor, discussing a disease and how it is contracted and the possible forms of treatment, and the side-effects that these may cause)<br/>c. Politics (vocabulary related to politics; elections; passing laws; issues like social security; healthcare system; taxation; etc).<br/>d. Social issues in South Asia such as female infanticide; plight of the elderly; untouchability, etc.<br/><br/>Bibliography:<br/><br/>Handouts made by the instructor, video and audio clips from Bollywood movies or TV shows such as \"Satyamev Jayate\" (http://www.satyamevjayate.in/), as well as Meena UNICEF (Hindi and Urdu)", "name": "Hindi-Urdu III: Topics in Intermediate Hindi-Urdu", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-319", "topic": "Society on Screen", "course": "211-3", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HIND_URD/211-3/10716", "instructor": ["Rami   Nair", "David Sol Boyk"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "10716", "subject": "HIND_URD"}]
