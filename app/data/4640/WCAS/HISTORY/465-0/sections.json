[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What counts as evidence in African history? Why has the answer to that question changed over time? In what ways have changes in the archive of African history changed the scope of the questions historians of Africa ask and historians ask of Africa? This course will introduce you to the history and politics of constituting archives for writing African history. Through critical reading of monographs, older and newer, we will learn about the mutual interplay between methodology, theory, and themes that have shaped the contents of African history since the middle of the 20th century. And, you will be introduced to non-traditional methods for writing history without documents.", "name": "Sources in African History", "section": "20", "topic": "History Without Documents", "course": "465-0", "meeting_time": ["We 10:00AM - 1:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HISTORY/465-0/12406", "instructor": ["David Lee   Schoenbrun"], "id": "12406", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
