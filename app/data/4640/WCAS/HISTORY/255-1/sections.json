[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The Anthropocene defines a period of time when human activities began very broadly to affect Earth's ecosystems. When did this begin in Africa? And how did Africans respond? Are there valuable parallels we might draw on to think about current dimensions of ecological change? From the Sahara southwards, Africans combined complex agricultures, industrial quality metallurgy, and rich cultural knowledge of ecological process 3000 years ago, changing their environments, creating cities, global trade networks, and new political systems along the way. This course introduces you to these stories and helps you distinguish cause from consequence in the African Anthropocene. No prior knowledge of Africa or Environmental History needed.", "name": "Background to African Civilization and Culture: Origins to 17th C.", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "255-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HISTORY/255-1/17855", "instructor": ["David Lee   Schoenbrun"], "id": "17855", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
