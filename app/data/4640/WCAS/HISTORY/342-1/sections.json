[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The course covers the social, political, and cultural history of France in the period from the reign of Louis XIV (d. 1715) through the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Empire. The central question of the course is that posed nearly two centuries ago by Alexis de Tocqueville: why did the French get rid of their king and end up with an emperor? What profound changes did the French Revolution bring about and what remained the same? In search of the answer to these questions we will explore the political, social, and cultural history of this period including living conditions for the poor and the rich, the meaning and impact of the French Enlightenment, the personalities and shortcomings of rulers like Louis XIV, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and Napoleon, as well as the politics and culture of the Revolution itself. The history of this period is rich in historical drama, which will be covered in the lectures, but because it inspired thinkers like Marx, Tocqueville and others it also serves as a way of learning about theories of history: why do revolutions break out, why and how do they end?", "name": "History of Modern France: Ancien Regime and the French Revolution", "section": "1", "location": "Locy Hall 301", "topic": "", "course": "342-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HISTORY/342-1/12349", "instructor": ["Sarah C Maza"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "12349", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
