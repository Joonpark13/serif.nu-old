[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This field seminar examines classic and new scholarship on the growth of the CCP and the history of the PRC, from its founding to recent times. We will pay particular attention to the flurry of new work that reconsiders the 1950s and Cultural Revolution, as well as emerging scholarship on the post-Mao reform era, which has now irrevocably passed into &quot;history.&quot; Major themes will include modulations in the conception and structure of the Chinese state and its relationship with society, the transformation of the gender system, the growth of scientism in state and society, and China's shifting role in world affairs. Since the English-language scholarship in 20th c. China has expanded exponentially in the past decade, we will only be able to sample a few key works. Nonetheless, the seminar aims to make students aware of the wider literature.", "name": "Western Literature of Chinese History", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "481-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 4:00PM - 6:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HISTORY/481-0/12407", "instructor": ["Peter J Carroll"], "id": "12407", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
