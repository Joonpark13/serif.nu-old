[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In 1348 perhaps a third to one half of all Europeans died from a mysterious illness called the Black Death, which was only one of a number of calamities that disrupted normal life. In the wake of these disasters thinkers, artists, and a surprising number of common people began to search for explanations for what had gone wrong by asking questions about their own personal identities, about the obligations of a moral life, about the virtues of civic service, and about the their personal relationship with God. This course explores that search, which is what we now call the Renaissance. It began among the independent city-states of Italy, particularly Florence and Venice, and spread from them to the rest of Europe. The course will compare developments in Italy with those in northern Europe, especially on the political and family structures of the city-states, the culture of the princely courts, the ambitions of the Roman popes, the social and intellectual basis for artistic creativity, the origins of modern political thought and the scientific method, and the constraints and opportunities available to women.", "name": "The Age of the Renaissance", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "333-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HISTORY/333-0/12345", "instructor": ["Edward Wallace   Muir Jr"], "id": "12345", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
