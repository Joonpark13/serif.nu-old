[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course covers the period of U.S. history that most courses don't have time to discuss: 1968 to 2008. It examines the recent past through three defining features?globalization, neoliberalism, and inequality?to grasp their interconnections and influence over the past half century. It focuses on politics and political economy to better understand the forces that reshaped the United States and its relationship to the world in this era. Along the way it considers the risks and rewards of studying the recent past: what is the difference between history and journalism, what sources are available to assess recent events and what sources remain closed, and where is the line (and what is the difference) between historical analysis and political commentary? Prior background in History 210-2, History 315-2, History 316, or History 321 will be helpful to your success in this course.", "name": "The United States Since 1900: Late 20th C. to Present", "section": "1", "topic": "The United States Since 1968", "course": "315-3", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HISTORY/315-3/12325", "instructor": ["Michael J.
