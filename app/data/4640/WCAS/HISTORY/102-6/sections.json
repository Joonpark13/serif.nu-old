[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar will explore the topics of commemoration and remembrance as objects of historical analysis. It will include readings on memorials and other official commemorative forms, museums and controversies over museum exhibits, clashes over what should or should not be included in &quot;official&quot; histories of various sorts, oral histories, and materials that walk the thin line between personal testimony and public commentary. As such, it will be concerned directly with the construction of history in various forms, examinations of the strategies by which various constituencies claim something is or is not legitimate history, as well as with the historical content of the issues being commemorated. Special attention will be paid to the history of WWII and the Vietnam War.", "name": "First-Year Seminar-American History", "section": "20", "topic": "Museums, War Memorials &amp; Other Commemoration", "course": "102-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HISTORY/102-6/12305", "instructor": ["Laura E Hein"], "id": "12305", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "First-Year Seminar-American History", "section": "21", "topic": "Capitalism &amp; Its Opponents", "course": "102-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HISTORY/102-6/12306", "instructor": ["Daniel Sepinuck Immerwahr"], "id": "12306", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
