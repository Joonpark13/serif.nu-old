Something we do almost every day, shopping has a history that is tied up with the development of capitalism, empire and globalization, new roles for women and ideas about the family, changes in political culture, and new ideas about the self. In this research seminar, we will ask how such a mundane activity came to be laden with such varied and often negative meanings. How have people's relationships to the goods they purchase changed from the industrial revolution to the present? How have writers, philosophers, physicians, and critics conceived of the act of shopping? How have people thought about class, gender, race, nation, and politics through consumption? Can consumption be a political act? Drawing on primary sources (historical and literary texts), feminist scholarship, and historical monographs, this class with grapple with the historical relationships between consumption, sexuality, gender, race, and politics on a global scale."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Europe, Asia/Middle East, Americas"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "EVALUATION METHOD: Discussion 20%, site analysis 20%, primary source analysis 15%, paper abstract and outline 10%, final research paper 35%"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until order posted to Norris website<br/>Weber, Queen of Fashion: What Marie Antoinette Wore to the Revolution. 9780312427344.Modern Girl Research Group, The Modern Girl Around the World: Consumption, Modernity, and Globalization Zola, The Ladies' Paradise. 9780822343059.Bell, On Human Finery. 9780749000943.Cohen, A Consumers' Republic: The Politics of Mass Consumption in Postwar America. 9780375707377.Course reader"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "NOTES: Attendance at first class is mandatory"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:06 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
