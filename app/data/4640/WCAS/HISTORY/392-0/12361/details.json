Thus, Israel was established as a Jewish state but not exclusively so. The Palestinian Arabs who became Israeli citizens remained nationally and religiously bound to the outside Arab world. This necessarily resulted in a sharp crisis of loyalties, the Arab community being torn between its Israeli citizenship and its Arab national identity.<br/>Today the Arab minority constitutes nearly 20 percent of Israel's population. It has undergone intensive processes of change, generally referred to as: Israelization, Palestinization and Islamization.<br/>The seminar will focus on minority-majority relations in Israel, with special emphasis on three areas: first, the effect of modernization on the more traditional Arab society; second, the dilemma of national identity (the interrelation between the Israeli, Arab, Palestinian and Muslim/Christian components, the impact of the PLO and Hamas), political participation (Knesset) and the struggle of the Arab minority for equality, and third, the developments following the Oslo Accords, the establishment of the Palestinian Authority and the Intifada (the October 2000 Uprising; the discourse over the &quot;Jewish and Democratic&quot; nature of Israel; the search for alternative models - &quot;State of its Citizens&quot;, separatism, autonomy)."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Middle East Studies<br/>GRADING BASIS: ANC"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "EVALUATION METHOD: 392?class presentations, midterm, final. 395?class presentations, research paper of length (15-25 pages)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until order posted to Norris website<br/>Course pack"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:06 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
