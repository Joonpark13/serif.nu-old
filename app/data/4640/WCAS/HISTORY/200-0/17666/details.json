This course will grapple with the most important issues currently driving inquiry within the field. We will investigate pivotal developments in Native American history and build a foundation for future coursework. Course topics will include: the new worlds that Natives and various newcomers created, competing visions for what is now known as the United States, tribal sovereignty, federal Indian policy, notions of authenticity, structures of settler colonialism, resistance movements, Indigenous governance, cultural revitalization, conflict over natural resources, and urban experiences. We will also examine how stories about the Indigenous past have been politicized, and how Indigenous histories can reshape our broader understandings of American history and culture."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Americas"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Instructor: Doug Kiel"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:05 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
