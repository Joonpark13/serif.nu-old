[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The course explores the historical relationship between human societies and energy. Consider the contemporary United States, for instance. Its citizens make up some 5 percent of the world's population but account for 25 percent of the world's energy consumption. Why? Is there something in American culture that predisposes it to high energy consumption, or has its high-intensity energy system made American culture? What is the relationship between the political, social, and cultural evolution of modern America, and the evolution of its energy systems? And what does that relationship look like in other parts of the world? Over the course of the semester, we will examine the history of energy production, distribution, and consumption around the world, and the varied and evolving sociotechnical systems built up around those activities. We will grapple with the question of technological and social determinism - whether certain technologies make certain societies inevitable, or whether perhaps it is the other way around. Each week, we will explore one or two sources of energy, and look at their impact on the societies and people involved in its generation, distribution, and consumption. We will see how energy can shed light on topics as varied as geopolitical power relations, forms of government, war, labor organizing, gender roles, and notions of leisure.", "name": "New Introductory Courses in History", "section": "20", "topic": "Energy and Society: A Global History", "course": "200-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HISTORY/200-0/12414", "instructor": ["Fredrik   Meiton"], "id": "12414", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Long ignored and romanticized, Native American history has become a vibrant area of study rich with new scholarship. This course will grapple with the most important issues currently driving inquiry within the field. We will investigate pivotal developments in Native American history and build a foundation for future coursework. Course topics will include: the new worlds that Natives and various newcomers created, competing visions for what is now known as the United States, tribal sovereignty, federal Indian policy, notions of authenticity, structures of settler colonialism, resistance movements, Indigenous governance, cultural revitalization, conflict over natural resources, and urban experiences. We will also examine how stories about the Indigenous past have been politicized, and how Indigenous histories can reshape our broader understandings of American history and culture.", "name": "New Introductory Courses in History", "section": "22", "topic": "Introduction to Native American History", "course": "200-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HISTORY/200-0/17666", "instructor": ["Douglas   Kiel"], "id": "17666", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
