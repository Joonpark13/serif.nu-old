[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course considers key Victorian issues and debates about gender and sexuality. We explore ideas about marriage, masculinity/femininity, motherhood and the emergence towards the end of the nineteenth century of distinctly new gender and sexual identities like &quot;the new woman,&quot; &quot;the homosexual,&quot; and the predatory male &quot;beast.&quot; Contextualized within a broad social and cultural framework, we read Michel Foucault's influential twentieth-century account of the emergence of sexuality as a modern discourse and examine major issues like prostitution, the city and sexual crime, sexuality and empire, sex and the single woman, homosexuality on trial, and the &quot;scientific&quot; writings of Victorian sexologists. Readings include Queen Victoria's diary, Victorian novels, periodical articles, and controversial newspaper reports of child prostitution, sexual scandals, and the Jack the Ripper murders, as well as recent critical scholarship to help us situate and critique this material.", "name": "Gender and Sexuality in Victorian Britain", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "364-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HISTORY/364-0/17126", "instructor": ["Alexandra Simone Lindgren-Gibson"], "id": "17126", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
