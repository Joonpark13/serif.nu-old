[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Scientific change has profoundly reshaped human life in the past 200 years, transforming both the material world in which we live and our knowledge of how that world works. But change has worked in the opposite direction as well: social priorities and political agendas have shaped the development of scientific knowledge and medical practice. This class invites students in the sciences and the humanities to explore the dynamic relationship between science, medicine, and our broader society. In part one, we take up the Faustian relationship between the physical sciences and technological innovation. How has scientific knowledge been used to create technologies like global telecommunications and the atom bomb, and how have our theories of energy conservation and climate change been driven by technological change? In part two, we turn to the reciprocal relationship between the life sciences and social values. From Darwin to genomics, our knowledge of bio-medicine has developed in conjunction with public morals, altering our understandings of inheritance, race, and sexual difference, as well as our definitions of life and illness. The guiding premise throughout this course is that science is an intrinsically human activity and hence an integral part of our<br/>modern world.", "name": "History of Western Science and Medicine: In Modern Europe and America", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "275-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HISTORY/275-2/12318", "instructor": ["Kenneth L Alder"], "id": "12318", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
