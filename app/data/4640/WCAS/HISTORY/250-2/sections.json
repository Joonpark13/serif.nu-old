[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course offers an introduction to the main episodes and themes in modern history. Unlike other history classes, however, the focus will be not on a particular region or nation, but on the planet, taken as a whole. That broad scope will allow us to better understand large-scale phenomena, such as empire, industrial technology, communism, the two world wars, HIV/AIDS, and globalization. As the subtitle of this course suggests, particular attention will be given to the unlocking around 1750 of energy from fossil fuels and to the prosperity, inequality, and ecological change that resulted as humans unevenly switched from a low-energy regime to a high-energy one.", "name": "Global History: The Modern World", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "250-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HISTORY/250-2/12431", "instructor": ["Daniel Sepinuck Immerwahr"], "id": "12431", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
