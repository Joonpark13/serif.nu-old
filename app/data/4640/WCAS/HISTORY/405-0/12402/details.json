Why did become prominent in the last twenty years or so, and is there truth to rumors of its decline? How does it relate to other approaches to history, and how does it intersect with other disciplines? What are the rules, if any governing the use of evidence in cultural history? Do cultural-historical approaches lead to the neglect of causality in historical explanation? These are some of the questions we will explore in this version of the 405 seminar. The weekly sessions will include some of the following topics: the debate over historical &quot;objectivity&quot; and &quot;invention&quot;; the relationship between history and fiction; the influence of postmodernists and of thinkers like Michel Foucault on historical writing; cultural approaches to the history of gender, class, race and nationhood; and recent contributions to the history of material culture."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "PREREQUISITES: None for history students, instructor's permission for students from other departments"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "EVALUATION METHOD: Each student will write two or three short (3-5 pages) papers in preparation for class discussions, and a ten-page final paper applying a set of readings from class to a body of literature in her/his field of specialization.
