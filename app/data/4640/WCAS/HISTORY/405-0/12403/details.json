Oral history offers not only a different form of historical evidence but an opportunity to explore the characteristics of historical evidence. This course will begin with a brief discussion of historical evidence, orality, and textuality. We will then explore oral history methods, discuss issues of veracity, interpretation, and memory, and consider the works of several major oral historians.
