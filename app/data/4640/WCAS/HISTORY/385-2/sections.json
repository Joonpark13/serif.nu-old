Beginning with a bit of background on the early modern Mughal Empire and its decline, a period which coincided with the emergence of British political power in the Indian subcontinent, we will proceed to examine the ideologies and practices of 19th-century British colonial institutions, along with the rise of various types of resistance to their authority. From there, we will focus on the cultural and political underpinnings of India's 20th-century nationalist movement(s), and pay particular attention to the causes, as well as lingering effects, of the subcontinent's \"partition\" into the nations of India and Pakistan with the British withdrawal in 1947. Finally, we will examine the postcolonial history of recent decades, as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and other postcolonial South Asian states have navigated their way through the geopolitics of the Cold War, negotiated still unresolved disputes over resources or territories like Kashmir, and responded to the global spread of the South Asian diaspora.", "qtr": "Fall 2016", "name": "History of Modern South Asia, ca. 1750-present", "title": "WCAS HISTORY 385-2-20 History of Modern South Asia, ca. 1750-present", "lmod": "10/30/16 7:06 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/467-1241", "instructor_name": "Rajeev Kumar Kinra", "instructor_addr": "Harris Hall Room 307"}], "associated_classes": [{"component": "DIS", "room": "University Hall 418", "meeting_time": "Fr 9:00AM - 9:50AM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "University Hall 118", "meeting_time": "Fr 3:00PM - 3:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "Locy Hall 213", "meeting_time": "Fr 4:00PM - 4:50PM"}], "topic": "", "course": "385-2", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course will survey some of the key events and personages that have shaped late modern South Asian history.
