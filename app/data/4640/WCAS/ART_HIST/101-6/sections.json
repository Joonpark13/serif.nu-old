[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The seminar will study Impressionism, an innovative kind of art that arose in France during the third quarter of the nineteenth century. We will ask many questions about it. Was it truly a movement? Was it a style? What is the connection between Impressionism and the city of Paris? Do the canvases define a philosophy of modern urban life? Do they mark the beginnings of &quot;art about art&quot;? How was Impressionism shaped by competing image technologies? Why were the works denounced when they were first exhibited? What were the gender and sexual politics of the group? How did Impressionism change when it took root in the United States? The fundamental question is this: why is such a strange form of art so widely loved today?", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "1", "topic": "Impressionism", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ART_HIST/101-6/10547", "instructor": ["Susan Hollis   Clayson"], "id": "10547", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
