This course investigates European artistic production from the rise of Gothic architecture in the Ile-de-France in the mid-twelfth century to the various endings of the Middle Ages in the fifteenth century. Special attention will be given to the role of the senses in the search for knowledge, the complex interactions between different social classes and religious groups made visible in their artistic production, the motivations behind the technical developments showcased in the great cathedrals and the changing status of the artist."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Abbot Suger on the Abbey Church of St. Denis and Its Art Treasures, trans.
