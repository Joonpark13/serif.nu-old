[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course offers an introduction to the major artistic monuments of the ancient cultures of the regions known as Mesopotamia, Iran, Egypt, Greece, and the Roman Empire. We investigate a wide range of artistic traditions, styles, and types of artifacts, and our limited time together necessitates a focus on the highlights?by traditional consensus?of the art and architecture of these cultures. A primary objective is to present the key monuments that have influenced Western art over the centuries, along with skills in visual literacy and a basic understanding of the methods and aims of art historical study. Another goal is to provide insight into the specific historical contexts in which buildings, sculptures, and paintings were produced and the particular political, social, and religious functions they served. To provide exposure to a wide variety of material within a critical framework, we will examine specific case studies supplementing the textbook readings.", "name": "Introduction to Ancient Art", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "224-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ART_HIST/224-0/10548", "instructor": ["Ann C Gunter"], "id": "10548", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
