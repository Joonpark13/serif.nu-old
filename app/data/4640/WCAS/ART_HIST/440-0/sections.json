This seminar explores how ideas about architecture and urbanism took shape across this widespread realm and were used to forge consensus around the monarchy as the guarantor of religious stability and good government. Beginning with the seminal text of Henri Lefebvre, The Production of Space (1974/1991) and an introduction to the expansive geography of the early modern Spanish Habsburg realm, the seminar will consider urban, sacred, and court space employing case studies of key monuments and sites in Iberia as well as southern Italy, the Low Countries, and the Americas. Participants will undertake research on individual monuments or public spaces to be assigned at the outset of the quarter. A reading knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese would be beneficial but is not required for this seminar.
