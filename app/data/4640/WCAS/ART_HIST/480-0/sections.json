[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Pre-modern East Asian architecture has often shown itself to be ill at ease with the larger field of architectural history. A trabeated system in timber, the overhanging tiled eave that it holds up, and a box-like interior that it encloses, constitute a building tradition that seems to resist change. Despite early contacts with Europe, architecture in East Asia also remained impervious to outside influence until relatively recent times. The purposes of this seminar are twofold: we will try to account for these peculiarities through examining select topics in the historiography of East Asian architecture. We will survey the major monuments in the canon and discuss how to write about them. But we will do so with a view to including this material in conversations that are taking place within architectural studies at large. Weekly topics include debating the notion of &quot;style,&quot; typologies of space, pictorial representation of architecture, urban planning, and so forth. No knowledge of Asian languages is required.", "name": "Studies in Asian Art", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "480-0", "meeting_time": ["Fr 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ART_HIST/480-0/10574", "instructor": ["Jun   Hu"], "id": "10574", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
