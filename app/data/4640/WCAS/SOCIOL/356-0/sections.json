[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this class, we will investigate how gender - as a set of relations, identities and cultural schemas - shapes politics, including political participation and representation, the formation of social movements (e.g., the feminist and anti-ERA movements), and social policy, as well as how, in turn, political institutions and policy shape gender. We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both &quot;top down&quot; and &quot;bottom up&quot; perspectives. And we will take advantage of the fact that we are in the middle of a Presidential election to examine gendered politics in the contemporary United States.", "name": "Sociology of Gender", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "356-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/SOCIOL/356-0/17786", "instructor": ["Ann Shola   Orloff"], "id": "17786", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
