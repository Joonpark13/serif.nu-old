[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Most of our waking hours are spent participating in various types of formal organizations - schools, corporations, churches, or (unfortunately) prisons. We generally begin our lives in hospitals, and often end our days in nursing homes. While we want to join some organizations (e.g. Northwestern - go Cats!), we also avoid others like plague (e.g. the DMV). But where do organizations come from? What do they have in common? How to they shape who we get to know, how we get ahead or fall behind? Why do organizations change or fail to change?<br/><br/>We will begin to answer these questions using three main theoretical frameworks - sometimes referred to as \"rational,\" \"natural,\" and \"open\" systems approaches - that pull together the aspects of organizations in coherent approaches with different emphases and implications. By the end of the quarter, you will be able to think analytically about organizations from these different and sometimes competing perspectives. This should enable you to think about how you might better survive and thrive in our organizational world.", "name": "Sociology of Organizations", "section": "20", "location": "555 Clark B03", "topic": "", "course": "302-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/SOCIOL/302-0/14410", "instructor": ["Craig Michael Rawlings"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "14410", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
