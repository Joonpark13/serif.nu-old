In the first section of this course students will be introduced to ideational, rational and psychological explanations of genocide. Causes of genocide can be found at different levels of analysis. We will focus on theories at three different levels. First, we will look at how national and international processes such as modernization and political leadership cause genocide (macro level). Second, we will look at why individuals decide to participate in or condone mass killings (micro level). Third, we will look at what role subnational groups such as religious communities play (meso level). In the second part of this course, we will assess the validity of different explanations through the comparative study of three particular cases: the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide and Rwanda. Students will explore a fourth case on their own. We will end the course with a discussion on foreign intervention. / / Students will improve their analytical skills by drawing connections between social science theory, historical monographs, graphic novels, memoirs of genocide survivors, journalistic accounts, policy documents, and public debates on foreign intervention.
