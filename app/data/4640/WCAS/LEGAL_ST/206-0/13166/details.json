Law permits, prohibits, enables, legitimates, protects, and prosecutes citizens. Law shapes our day to day lives in countless ways. This course examines the connections and relationships of law and society using an interdisciplinary social science approach. As one of the founders of the Law and Society movement observed, &quot;law is too important to leave to lawyers.&quot; Accordingly, this course will borrow from several theoretical, disciplinary, and interdisciplinary perspectives (such as sociology, anthropology, political science, critical studies, psychology) in order to explore the sociology of law and law's role primarily in the American context (but with some attention to international law and global human rights efforts). The thematic topics to be discussed include law and social control; law's role in social change; as well as law's capacity to reach into complex social relations and intervene in existing normative institutions, organizational structures, and the like."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "By the end of this course students will be expected to know how to read and brief a judicial opinion, basic theories of the relationship between law and society, and how empirical data is and can be integrated into judicial and policy decision making."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Short written assignments, 2 midterms, and participation"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Course Pack will be made available."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:07 PM (CT)", "subject": "LEGAL_ST"}]
