This course explores how the international legal system works from a legal and political perspective, shaping international relations today. <br/>The course provides an introduction to some aspects of the method and substance of international law, learning some key legal concepts like sovereign immunity, jus cogens, general principles of international law, principles of jurisdiction etc. But this is not a law course. We cover legal subjects to understand how politics and law interact in shaping international relations today. Substantively, the course examines international laws related to the oceans, the environment, human rights, trade and war. We read treaties, and use case studies to see how international law is made, why national governments and national courts at times contest international law, and why international law can be difficult to enforce. We explore the legal and political issues surrounding contemporary flashpoints in international relations: China's claims to the South China Seas, how civil conflict is fueling the poaching of elephants, the United States Supreme Court's ambivalence regarding international law, how international law regarding torture is and is not politically relevant.", "name": "Topics in Legal Studies", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall 107", "topic": "Politics of International Law", "course": "376-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/LEGAL_ST/376-0/13157", "instructor": ["Karen   Alter-Hanson"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "13157", "subject": "LEGAL_ST"}]
