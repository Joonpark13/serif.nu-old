The overall course goal is to learn both fundamental theory and applications concerning the chemistry of molecules and materials. The fall quarter covers atomic and molecular structure, electronic states, electronic spectroscopy, quantum mechanics, chemical bonding theory and the descriptive chemistry of both main group elements and transition metals. In addition, the thermodynamic and structural properties of gases, liquids and solids are studied, as is radiochemistry, nanomaterials, and transition metals in biology. Typically there are three lectures each week plus a discussion class and a laboratory lecture (Chem 181-0). Weekly homework is assigned. Grades are based on exams and quizzes.", "qtr": "Fall 2016", "name": "Accelerated General Inorganic Chemistry", "title": "WCAS CHEM 171-0-01 Accelerated General Inorganic Chemistry", "lmod": "10/30/16 7:01 PM (CT)", "section": "01", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "George C Schatz", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "171-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Co-Requisite:  Students must also register for Chemistry 181-0. <br/>Add both classes to the shopping cart and submit together for successful registration.", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This is the first quarter of the Accelerated General Chemistry sequence.
