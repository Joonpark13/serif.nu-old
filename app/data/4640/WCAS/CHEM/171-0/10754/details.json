The overall course goal is to learn both fundamental theory and applications concerning the chemistry of molecules and materials. The fall quarter covers atomic and molecular structure, electronic states, electronic spectroscopy, quantum mechanics, chemical bonding theory and the descriptive chemistry of both main group elements and transition metals. In addition, the thermodynamic and structural properties of gases, liquids and solids are studied, as is radiochemistry, nanomaterials, and transition metals in biology. Typically there are three lectures each week plus a discussion class and a laboratory lecture (Chem 181-0). Weekly homework is assigned. Grades are based on exams and quizzes."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: AP Score of 3 or better; IB Score of 5 or better; qualifying score on Chemistry Placement Exam (available only to incoming first-year students).<br/><br/>Students enrolled in this class MUST also enroll in the associated laboratory course, Chem 181-0."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight by Atkins et al., 7th Edition, W.H.
