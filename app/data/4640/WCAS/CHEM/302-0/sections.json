[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course covers basic concepts in Inorganic Chemistry. It is designed to introduce students in key subjects which are used over and over again in chemistry and uses inorganic chemistry systems to illustrate the concepts. The course covers the donor-acceptor concept, hard-soft acids-bases, advanced concepts of basicity and acidity and acid-base view of salvation phenomena. The course also delves into introductory solid state chemistry including unit cells and the structure of simple solids, structure types and electronic structure and Band Theory (with the aim of understanding properties). <br/><br/>A certain fraction of the time is also devoted to descriptive chemistry which utilizes the concepts learned in the first part of the course and the focus is generally on main group chemistry. This includes the chemistry of hydrogen and the chemistry of the elements of Group 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.", "name": "Principles of Inorganic Chemistry", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "302-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 5:00PM - 6:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/CHEM/302-0/10885", "instructor": ["Merkouri G Kanatzidis"], "id": "10885", "subject": "CHEM"}]
