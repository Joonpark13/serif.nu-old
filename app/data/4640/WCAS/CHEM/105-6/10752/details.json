However if one looks more closely one discovers that art and science have developed in parallel fashion throughout history. Capabilities in the art world have changed dramatically due to scientific invention. Perhaps more surprisingly some aspects of scientific research have been driven by the need for new capabilities originally expressed from the art world. This seminar will consider the intimate relationship between chemistry and fine arts from the point of view of the evolution of capabilities through history, the evolution (or degradation) of individual works of art with time, the importance of chemistry in detecting art forgery, and the adverse effects of the link between art and science on economy and personal and environmental health."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "1. &quot;Color: A Natural History of the Palette&quot; by Victoria Finlay ($17.00 new; $12.75 used)*<br/>2. &quot;Mauve: How One Man Invented a Color that Changed the World&quot; by Simon Garfield ($18.95 new; $14.20 used)*<br/>3. &quot;Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Color&quot; by Philip Ball ($18.00 new; 13.50 used)*<br/><br/>*Prices as listed by the Norris Bookstore on 6/23/16.
