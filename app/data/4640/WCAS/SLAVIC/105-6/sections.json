[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course we will explore some of the sociolinguistic issues (that is connections between language and society) in various Slavic speaking countries and areas (the Russian Federation, the former Soviet Union, the former Czechoslovakia, etc.) and in Central Europe (specifically, Turkish in Germany). We will also look at contemporary issues in Russia and the Ukraine as these relate to sociolinguistic issues, particularly the annexation of the Crimea, anti-gay laws in Russia, and censorship of Pussy Riot. Issues to be examined include: language policies, minority language rights, language vs. dialect, language planning, language and identity, and language and nationalism. As the final paper for this course, students will work on any geopolitical area in the world and examine the sociolinguistic issues particular to that region or linguistic variety. Some previous papers, for example, have looked at the role of Japanese in Korea; Koreans in Japan and language discrimination issues; the languages of South Africa; the status of African-American English (or African-American Vernacular English, or Black English) in the US and the controversy surrounding it in the 1990s in the Oakland, CA school district; US language change and the Internet and social media; Celtic in Ireland; the successful revival of a dead language, e.g., Hebrew, as the official language of Israel; language rights in the EU; American Indian languages; bilingualism in the US or Canada; Kurdish language discrimination in Turkey; and others.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "20", "topic": "From Fascism to Pussy Riot", "course": "105-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/SLAVIC/105-6/14337", "instructor": ["Elisabeth M Elliott"], "id": "14337", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
