Students are expected to gain knowledge in classic Russian cinematography, as well as in the theatrical &quot;method&quot; of Stanislavsky and &quot;biomechanics&quot; of Meyerhold that were influential in shaping Russian film theory and history. In class, students will watch the major films by Protazanov, Eisenstein, Pudovkin, and Vertov and discuss them with the Professor. The primary texts for the course will be the films themselves, but the most important theoretical essays by Kuleshov, Eisenstein, Pudovkin, and Vertov will be provided during the course and discussed in class."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Each time students meet with the Professor, there will be a 1,5 hour lecture plus discussion of the film we have watched and on the one we will be watching after the lecture."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Evaluation will be based on a Midterm in-class exam - 35%, attendance and participation in the discussion - 15%, and Final in-class exam - 50%."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:10 PM (CT)", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
