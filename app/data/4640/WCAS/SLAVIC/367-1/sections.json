[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The goal of this course is to provide students with a firm understanding of the major contributions of Russian film art to world cinema, especially what is often termed Russian, or dialectical, montage, introduced in the early 20th century by Lev Kuleshov and developed by Sergei Eisenstein. Students are expected to gain knowledge in classic Russian cinematography, as well as in the theatrical &quot;method&quot; of Stanislavsky and &quot;biomechanics&quot; of Meyerhold that were influential in shaping Russian film theory and history. In class, students will watch the major films by Protazanov, Eisenstein, Pudovkin, and Vertov and discuss them with the Professor. The primary texts for the course will be the films themselves, but the most important theoretical essays by Kuleshov, Eisenstein, Pudovkin, and Vertov will be provided during the course and discussed in class.", "name": "Russian Film", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "367-1", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/SLAVIC/367-1/14360", "instructor": ["Ilya   Kutik"], "id": "14360", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
