It explores the ways Russian literature informed and inspired the social opinions, cultural arguments and artistic practices of major Chinese writers within the social-historical context of early 20th-Century China. Through a comparative study of texts in different genres - short story, novel, drama, etc. - we shall consider such questions as: How did Russian literature become the dominant source of influence and enlightenment for Chinese intelligentsia? What did the Chinese writers, driven by the need to practice a new literature that would serve as a &quot;cure for society&quot;, strive to find in their dialogue with the Russian writers? How did Chinese writers incorporate the themes and styles of their Russian predecessors into a different cultural tradition? These questions will allow us to fully understand the history and mechanism of this dialogue across cultures and centuries, and see how literature plays its pivotal role in the life of two nations."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Students will improve their understanding of cross-cultural communication and ability of comparative analysis through reading and discussion of literary texts within different cultural and social-historical contexts.
