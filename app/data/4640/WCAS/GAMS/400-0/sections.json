[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar offers an introduction to the avant-gardes of the early twentieth century. Our survey includes canonical European avant-gardes and their international circulation, but also a range of non-European movements: Futurism in Italy and Russia; Berlin Dada; Stridentism in Mexico; Surrealism in France, Japan, and Egypt; Brazilian Anthropofagism; and N\u00e9gritude. Our focus will be on manifestos, literary works, and critical theories of the avant-garde, but we will also consider the visual arts, with a planned group trip to the Art Institute of Chicago.", "name": "Modernism and the Avant-garde: History and Theory", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "400-0", "meeting_time": ["We 3:30PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/GAMS/400-0/17374", "instructor": ["Christopher Paul Bush"], "id": "17374", "subject": "GAMS"}]
