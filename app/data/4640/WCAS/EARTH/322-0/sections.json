[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Introduction to computational methods for processing and analyzing geophysical and geochemical data. Students will work in a unix environment and learn about the principles of computer programming in various languages, with python being the laguage of choice for the remainder of the course. Students will also utilize shell scripting and the Generic Mapping Tools extensively, and will learn the basics of parallel processing. Weekly exercises/problem sets will include time series processing and analysis, the numerical solution of differential equations, simple inverse problems and associated error estimation, and are designed to build familiarity and core strengths while individual and group projects illustrate the computational research process from raw data to polished \"research product\" and inspire tool development and innovation.", "name": "Introduction to Scientific Computing in the Physical Sciences", "section": "01", "location": "Technological Institute F491", "topic": "", "course": "322-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/EARTH/322-0/11207", "instructor": ["Suzan   van der Lee"], "class_attributes": "Formal Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "11207", "subject": "EARTH"}]
