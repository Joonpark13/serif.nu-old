[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The earth is a messy and complicated system that we study with data that are imprecise, inaccurate, inconsistent, and insufficient. As a result, our ideas about how the earth works and what it will do in the future have considerable uncertainties. This course introduces some approaches from statistics and probability that are used to address issues of uncertainty and forecasting in the geosciences including natural hazards, climate change, and how the planet works. Grading is based on homework, in-class problems, a project, and write-ups of several department seminars.", "name": "Data Analysis for Earth and Planetary Sciences", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "326-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/EARTH/326-0/11257", "instructor": ["Seth A Stein"], "id": "11257", "subject": "EARTH"}]
