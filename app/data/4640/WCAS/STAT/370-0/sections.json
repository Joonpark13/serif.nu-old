[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "We consider uses of statistics - as numbers and as methodology - for use in the context of Human Rights (HR). We take as HR those stipulated in existing international laws, but we may also consider HR not covered by those laws. The emphasis of the course is on the discovery and critique of statistical methods used in the HR context, including development, analysis, interpretation, use, and misuse of statistical data for description, assessment, evaluation, and political action. Some examples of HR topics include missing females, deaths of combatants and noncombatants from war, disappearances, criminal justice, violence against women, trafficking, child labor, profiling, free elections, hunger, refugees, poverty, illegal immigration, hate crimes and discrimination.", "name": "Human Rights Statistics", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "370-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/STAT/370-0/16565", "instructor": ["Bruce David   Spencer"], "id": "16565", "subject": "STAT"}]
