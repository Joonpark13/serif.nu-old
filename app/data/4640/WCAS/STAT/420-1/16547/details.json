Statistics 420-1 covers distribution theory. Distribution theory is concerned with probability distributions of random variables, particularly those concepts that arise frequently in statistical theory. The emphasis on this course is on the precise and careful statement of results and on the accurate determination of quantities such as moments, distribution functions, and so on, that are often used in statistical methodology. Prerequisites: A good background in calculus, real analysis (e.g., the concept of a limit), linear algebra, elementary probability theory, and statistical methods."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites: A good background in calculus, real analysis (e.g., the concept of a limit), linear algebra, elementary probability theory, and statistical methods."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Evaluation Method: Homeworks, Midterm Exam, Final Exam, Participation/Attendance."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "ISBN: 978-0521844727; <br/>Elements of Distribution Theory; <br/>T.A.
