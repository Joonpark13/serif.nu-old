Topics include (1) sample designs such as simple random, stratified, and cluster sampling, (2) choosing the appropriate statistical estimators to use in conjunction with a given design, (3) accounting for non-response, and (4) estimating the sampling variances of estimators. The course does not cover questionnaire design."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "i) Calculus at level of Math 234 (multiple integration and vector calculus), and (ii) Two previous courses in probability and statistics, including at lease one at the 300 level in either Statistics (other than Stat 330), Econometrics, IE/MS, Math or MMSS.<br/><br/> If you do not meet both prerequisites (i) and (ii) you need permission of instructor. The formal mathematical level is not high but the conceptual level is challenging for many undergraduates. Statistics majors are encouraged but not required to take Stat 320 first.
