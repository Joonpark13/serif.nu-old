More data being created all the time and the rate of data creation is accelerating. This course is an introduction to fundamental topics in data science. It will give a broad survey of methods for supervised learning and some experience with each of them, but will not give an in depth coverage of any of them. More advanced topics and topics in unsupervised learning will be covered in subsequent courses (we anticipate that these will be Statistics 301-II and Statistics 301-III), including substantial projects that will provide project based learning as those projects require in depth experience with methods. This course assumes a basic knowledge of the idea of distributions, estimation and hypothesis testing. It also assumes some experience with programming languages like R and Python and software for data analysis. While we will offer an introduction to programming languages, we will not offer a comprehensive course in either programming language."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "No textbook information supplied.
