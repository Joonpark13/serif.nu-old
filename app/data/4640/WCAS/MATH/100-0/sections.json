[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is designed to help students address topical, real-life questions using numerical analysis, or quantitative reasoning.Some examples: How much will this car cost me? How many people died in the Civil War? Should I be worried about arsenic in rice? The aim of the course is to develop a student's ability to apply basic mathematical skills to make carefully reasoned, quantitative arguments.<br/><br/>The course reinforces qualitative aspects of reasoning, such as the responsible treatment of sources, assumptions, biases, errors, and ethics. On the quantitative side, we review and develop the needed mathematical skills, including algebra, functions, graphs, units, scientific notation, probability and some statistics. The real focus, however, is the coherent assembly of<br/>all of these skills. This is learned through the extensive, worked examples in the text, in class discussions, and through group projects.", "name": "Quantitative Reasoning", "section": "41", "location": "Technological Institute M164", "topic": "", "course": "100-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/MATH/100-0/17760", "instructor": ["Eric   Zaslow"], "class_attributes": "Formal Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "17760", "subject": "MATH"}]
