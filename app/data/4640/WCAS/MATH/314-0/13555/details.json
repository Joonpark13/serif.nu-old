It is a prerequisite for Economics 381-1, Econometrics. The first part of this course covers the structure of probability theory, which is the foundation of statistics, and provides examples of the use of probabilistic reasoning. The course then moves to discussion of the most commonly encountered probability distributions, both discrete and continuous. Next, the course considers random sampling from a population, and the distributions of some sample statistics. From there the course moves to estimation, which is the process of using data (in the best possible way) to learn about the values of unknown parameters of a population or model. Finally, the course treats hypothesis testing, which is a way to decide whether data are consistent or inconsistent with a hypothesis about a feature of a population or model."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "ISBN: 978-0321500465 Probability and Statistics, 4th ed<br/>DeGroot and Schervish<br/>Pearson"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Students may not receive credit for both 314 and any of MATH 310-1, 311-1, 385, EECS 302, IEMS 202, or STAT 320-1, 383."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:07 PM (CT)", "subject": "MATH"}]
