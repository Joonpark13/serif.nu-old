Topics include the solution of boundary and initial-value problems for the heat equation, the wave equation and Laplace's equation in both rectangular, cylindrical and spherical coordinates. Special attention will be paid to questions of convergence and asymptotic behavior of the series solutions. Use of the Fourier integral permits an overview of the series solutions obtained."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "240 and 250 or equivalent"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "ISBN: 978-0470458310 <br/>Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems, 10th ed <br/>Boyce and DiPrima <br/>Wiley"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Students may not receive credit for both 351 and 381-0 or 351 and ESAM 311-2."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:07 PM (CT)", "subject": "MATH"}]
