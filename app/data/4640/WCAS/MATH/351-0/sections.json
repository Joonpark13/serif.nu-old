[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "A one-quarter introduction to partial differential equations and their solution by the methods of Fourier analysis. Topics include the solution of boundary and initial-value problems for the heat equation, the wave equation and Laplace's equation in both rectangular, cylindrical and spherical coordinates. Special attention will be paid to questions of convergence and asymptotic behavior of the series solutions. Use of the Fourier integral permits an overview of the series solutions obtained.", "name": "Fourier Analysis & Boundary Value Problems", "section": "61", "location": "Lunt Hall 103", "topic": "", "course": "351-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeThFr 12:00PM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/MATH/351-0/13474", "instructor": ["Steven Morris Zelditch"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "13474", "subject": "MATH"}]
