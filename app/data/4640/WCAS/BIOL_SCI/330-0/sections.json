[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will introduce the student to the world of plants. We will begin with concepts of plant structure and physiology such as cell types, organs and photosynthesis. From this basis we will explore the evolutionary diversity of plants, culminating in the angiosperms, the dominant plants today. We will end with a study of the interactions of plants with one another, other organisms, and their environment. The goals of this course are an understanding of plant biology, the unique characteristics of plants, as well as their similarities to and relationships with other organisms. PROJECTS: Students will grow plants from seed and observe them outside of class to reinforce concepts from lecture. Students will also be working in teams to identify plants in the area surrounding the lagoon.", "name": "Plant Biology", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "330-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 9:00AM - 9:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/330-0/11488", "instructor": ["Christina T Russin"], "id": "11488", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
