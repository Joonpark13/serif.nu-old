[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course explores the relationship between the three dimensional structure of proteins and their function. First we cover basic principles of protein architecture. We then focus on the relationship between protein structure and function. Classes of proteins discussed in detail include enzymes, DNA binding proteins, membrane proteins, and nucleotide binding proteins. Methods for determining protein structures are also briefly covered. Finally, students will learn how to display and manipulate three dimensional macromolecular structures on the computer.", "name": "Protein Structure and Function", "section": "20", "location": "Tech Institute Lecture Room 4", "topic": "", "course": "361-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/361-0/11483", "instructor": ["Amy C Rosenzweig"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "11483", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
