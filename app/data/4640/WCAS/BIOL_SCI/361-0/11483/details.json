First we cover basic principles of protein architecture. We then focus on the relationship between protein structure and function. Classes of proteins discussed in detail include enzymes, DNA binding proteins, membrane proteins, and nucleotide binding proteins. Methods for determining protein structures are also briefly covered. Finally, students will learn how to display and manipulate three dimensional macromolecular structures on the computer."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites: BIO 218; Physics 125-1,2,3 or 130-1,2,3 or 135-1,2,3"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lectures, discussions, and homework."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Exams, class participation and homework."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "No required textbook"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "value": "How Proteins Work, 1st Edition, by Mike Williamson, Garland Science, ISBN: 9780815344469"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:59 PM (CT)", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
