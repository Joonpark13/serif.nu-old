Students will be able to describe features that characterize animals, and give essential differences in body plan and organ systems among phyla that relate to physiology.<br/>2. Students will be able to describe the central importance of energy metabolism in animal physiology, including how metabolic rate depends on animal size, phylogenetic class, body and environmental temperature, and exercise for poikilotherms and homeotherms.<br/>3. Students will be able to describe the functions of the digestive, cardiovascular, respiratory, and excretory systems for mammals, and identify important differences in these systems across the vertebrate classes.<br/>4. Students will be able to describe endocrine control of metabolism and salt and water balance, including the hormones involved, the stimuli causing release of the hormones, and the action of the hormones.<br/>5. Students will be able to identify similarities and differences of different types of muscles, and explain basic control mechanisms for them.<br/>Skills:<br/>1. Students will be able to manipulate physical, chemical, and mathematical concepts relevant to the physiological systems under consideration to solve quantitative problems that extend understanding of the physiology. Important concepts include dependent vs. independent variables, power laws, properties of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the gas and liquid phase, pressure-flow-resistance equations, osmolarity, and heat and mass transfer mechanisms.<br/>2. Students will be able to use spreadsheets to manipulate and graph data.<br/>3. Students will learn conventions of scientific writing and be able to use these to assist their reading of the literature and the development of their own scientific writing.<br/>4. Students will be able to write a paper that uses research literature in physiology to generate answers to questions and generate proposals for further research."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and discussion section.
