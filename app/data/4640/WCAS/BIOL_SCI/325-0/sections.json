[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is a quantitative animal physiology course focusing on vertebrates, but the higher levels of invertebrates (mollusks and arthropods) will also be considered at some times. The emphasis will be on the physiological mechanisms used by animals to meet the common challenges of circulation, gas exchange, nutrient supply and metabolism, temperature regulation, water balance, and locomotion in the context of their environments.", "name": "Animal Physiology", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "325-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 9:00AM - 9:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/325-0/11479", "instructor": ["Robert A Linsenmeier"], "id": "11479", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
