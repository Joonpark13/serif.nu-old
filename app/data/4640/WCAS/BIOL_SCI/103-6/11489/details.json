In fact, the structure of living things can only be fully understood and appreciated in the context of history (evolution), growth and development (ontogeny), and operation (function). This seminar will explore topics in the evolution, ontogeny, and function of organisms with backbones (vertebrates) that inform the scientific understanding of the human form. In the process of exploring these topics, the main learning goal of the course will be addressed: to practice the variety of writing skills needed by students to successfully communicate science ideas in college courses and beyond."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "First-years only"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion plus a variety of in-class exercises."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Students will be evaluated primarily on writing assignments, plus short oral presentations and other individual and group exercises.<br/><br/>There will be six graded writing assignments of various lengths ranging from 1 to 8 pages."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Text for the class is A Short Guide to Writing About Biology, Ninth edition, by Jan A.
