[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Anatomy is often thought of as simply a series of facts and spatial relationships that must be memorized. In fact, the structure of living things can only be fully understood and appreciated in the context of history (evolution), growth and development (ontogeny), and operation (function). This seminar will explore topics in the evolution, ontogeny, and function of organisms with backbones (vertebrates) that inform the scientific understanding of the human form. In the process of exploring these topics, the main learning goal of the course will be addressed: to practice the variety of writing skills needed by students to successfully communicate science ideas in college courses and beyond.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "20", "topic": "Anatomy: Evolution, Ontogeny, &amp; Function", "course": "103-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 9:00AM - 9:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/103-6/11489", "instructor": ["Laura J Panko"], "id": "11489", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
