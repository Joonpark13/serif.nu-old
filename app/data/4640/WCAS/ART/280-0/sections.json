[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Fall Quarter OnlyThis course is designed for art majors in their junior year who have already taken multiple courses in the department and are working towards building a self- directed practice. The emphasis is on practice as the material basis of an artist's creative activity, a set of concrete working behaviors, processes and strategies that may include, but is not limited to, forms of sketching, questioning, brainstorming, self-imposed challenges, chance operations, material investigations, devising and executing of tasks, juxtaposing, copying, repeating, revising, compiling, ordering, editing and research. Throughout the quarter, students will investigate different strategies and modes of exploration and experimentation so that each student may discover what works best in the development and expansion of her or his own daily working process. We may also look at established artists for possible models of active studio practices.
