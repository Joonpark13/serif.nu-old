Importantly, the camera that moves around does not function as a distanced or neutral spectator. Rather, the presence and gaze of the camera functions to disrupt, challenge, and even expand the space(s) of the live act. This archival technology does not simply record the performance but absolutely takes part in it as a participant, changing the very nature of the performance it documents.<br/>In this course students will investigate relationships between dance / performance art and its documentation in photography and video. We will study photography and film as they function as indexical records of ephemeral, temporally fleeting phenomena and consider how this now- permanent record becomes the basis for repetition and re-performance. Theoretical readings on film theory, performance art, and dance will situate seminal works within their greater socio- cultural milieu as a way to investigate their impact on art practices, art spectatorship, and the society more broadly. Through substantive analysis of course readings, assigned media, creative workshops, and seeing live performances, students will develop the skills to analyze both theoretical arguments and works of art. Students will be asked to write two short reflective papers, and to create their own movement scores to be recorded and edited on their personal media devices.<br/><br/>This class will be taught by multi-disciplinary Visiting Artist, Brendan Fernandes, a Canadian artist of Kenyan and Indian descent. He completed the Independent Study Program of the Whitney Museum of American Art (2007) and earned his MFA (2005) from The University of Western Ontario and his BFA (2002) from York University in Canada.
