Our theme is Risk. Humans are exposed to countless dangers on a daily basis and many calls to action. Yet we so often fail to act. How can invisible risk be made visible enough for people to take action? How can we take examples of &quot;great danger&quot; in our media environment and flip the discourse?<br/><br/>Engineering makes risk visible by first quantifying it to then make it disappear (in bridges, anti-lock brakes, etc); design has made safety fashionable (sunglasses, hats, rapidly inflating bike helmets that look like scarves). Art looks to push risk forward as a way of dismantling comfort.<br/><br/>Zones of risk can be areas of power struggle, where marginalized groups at risk try to make the risk visible, while power structures that find this risk inconvenient have tried to make it invisible. We see this in the history of AIDS activism, and more recently, in the Black Lives Matter movement, both of which have had strong ties to the visual arts.<br/><br/>We can view several looming existential threats to humanity as examples where the increase in risk is too shallow to trigger our usual motivated responses, like the parable of the frog in the warming pot of water not ever realizing it was getting too hot to live. The smokestack can be considered an icon of this idea: without a long chimney, people would fight the pollution, but by making pollutants go high into the atmosphere, we put the risk below the threshold of action. Examples of this problem include the rise of CO2, the fall of biodiversity, and increasing inequality.<br/><br/>At the heart of this class is the hope that students will develop an ethical program as individual artists and designers. Students will be asked to approach their research and project in ways that range from countering risk to increasing the gradient of risk so that we must act now. Indeed, sometimes we need better monsters.", "name": "Special Topics in Art", "section": "20", "topic": "Risk", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 11:20AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ART/390-0/10611", "instructor": ["Malcolm Angus MacIver", "Michael J Rakowitz"], "id": "10611", "subject": "ART"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "ART 390 Studio/Seminar: Art as Vandalism<br/>Instructors: Jeanne Dunning and Irena Haiduk<br/>Fall 2016<br/><br/>It's better to apologize than ask permission.<br/>Vandalism as an art making strategy is intrinsic to contemporary art practice. Art as Vandalism asks its participants to take vandalism seriously and put it to use through interventions in public space and destructive acts that lead to ungoverned outcomes. Through the realization of projects in relation to reading and discussion, we will explore the ways in which disruption and destruction can lead to transformation. We will spend time with authors such as Badiou and Agamben, artists including Daniel Buren, Art and Language, Martha Rosler and Daniil Kharms, and the manifestos of Ted Kaczinski (a.k.a. the unibomber) and Steven Shearer, who wrote &quot;APOCALYPTIC HARVEST, PESTILENT FUNERAL FOGS, WHISPERS OF SUFFERING, ANCESTRAL NECROSODOMY, FECULENT BLACK EARTH, RELENTLESS SLAUGHTER, ENIGMATICAL HUMAN HATRED, SPHERE OF ROTTING, FLOURESCENT BLEEDING CHAOS, FOUL WINDS OF PUTREFACTION, ETERNAL DISMEMBERMENT, CADAVERIC MANSTRUBATION, CENTURIES IN DECOMPOSITION DESTROY SACRED WORDS. &quot;<br/><br/>This course has no prerequisites and is open to both undergraduate and graduate students.", "name": "Special Topics in Art", "section": "21", "topic": "Art as Vandalism", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 4:00PM - 6:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ART/390-0/10612", "instructor": ["Jeanne   Dunning", "Irena   Knezevic"], "id": "10612", "subject": "ART"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "ART390 Special Topics: Painting as Image Platform<br/><br/>This painting class will consider the nature of image labor in an environment where context seems perpetually dislocated and the notion of the self is often more a negotiation than a defined statement. That is to say, what does it mean to make a painting in the 21st century? Through the quarter, we will consider how one can become a producing interlocutor, negotiating the labor of handmade production through traditional and digital output. While painting obviously has deep roots as a traditional media, we will treat it as a contemporary image platform, something that is reconfigured according to material surface, context and content.<br/> <br/>Our focus throughout the course will be on the synthesis of form, material and content in order to produce output with presence. We will produce images through traditional means such as painting, drawing and collage. But we will also consider printing techniques such as mono-print, screen print and digitally printed ?painting' as functions of the development of contemporary painting. So our paintings, such as they are, may manifest themselves as oil or acrylic paintings, collages, posters, T-Shirts, stickers, iphone cases, coffee mugs, etc. We will consider the work of Barbara Kruger, Jenny Holzer, Sara Charlesworth, Gretchen Bender, Allan McCollum, Albert Oehlen, Artie Verkant, Rafael Rozendaal, Tauba Auerbach, Doug Ashford, Adam Henry, and Laura Owens.<br/> <br/>While primarily a studio course, readings, lectures and in class conversations will provide a framework for the propositions made by the class. Introductory art courses are useful antecedents, but they are not requisites for the course. But this is not a ?technique' based course, so searching production and initiative are vital.
