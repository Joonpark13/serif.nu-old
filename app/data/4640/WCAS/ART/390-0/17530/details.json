That is to say, what does it mean to make a painting in the 21st century? Through the quarter, we will consider how one can become a producing interlocutor, negotiating the labor of handmade production through traditional and digital output. While painting obviously has deep roots as a traditional media, we will treat it as a contemporary image platform, something that is reconfigured according to material surface, context and content.<br/> <br/>Our focus throughout the course will be on the synthesis of form, material and content in order to produce output with presence. We will produce images through traditional means such as painting, drawing and collage. But we will also consider printing techniques such as mono-print, screen print and digitally printed ?painting' as functions of the development of contemporary painting. So our paintings, such as they are, may manifest themselves as oil or acrylic paintings, collages, posters, T-Shirts, stickers, iphone cases, coffee mugs, etc. We will consider the work of Barbara Kruger, Jenny Holzer, Sara Charlesworth, Gretchen Bender, Allan McCollum, Albert Oehlen, Artie Verkant, Rafael Rozendaal, Tauba Auerbach, Doug Ashford, Adam Henry, and Laura Owens.<br/> <br/>While primarily a studio course, readings, lectures and in class conversations will provide a framework for the propositions made by the class. Introductory art courses are useful antecedents, but they are not requisites for the course. But this is not a ?technique' based course, so searching production and initiative are vital. Non-art majors are welcome."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "No prerequisites. Open to Undergraduate and Graduate Students."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:58 PM (CT)", "subject": "ART"}]
