Readings, films, discussion, and written responses will be historically contextualized to chart the Holocaust as it originated in racial and gender theories that underwrote the mythic construction of a &quot;master race.&quot; Discussion and written responses will explore the complications of Nazi scientific racism, its cult and crisis of masculinity, and paradoxical idealization of women and misogyny. We will also consider how literature and films depict these complications in the policies and practices of Nazi Germany's Third Reich and in the suffering and mass murder of Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, and others. Finally, we will discuss and write about the policies and practices of Nazism as challenges to all other categories and theories of race and gender even today."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Coursepack and books"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:05 PM (CT)", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}]
