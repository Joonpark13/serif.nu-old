[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will introduce writing and film that represent responses to the experiences of men and women who were victims, survivors, perpetrators, and bystanders of the Holocaust. Readings, films, discussion, and written responses will be historically contextualized to chart the Holocaust as it originated in racial and gender theories that underwrote the mythic construction of a &quot;master race.&quot; Discussion and written responses will explore the complications of Nazi scientific racism, its cult and crisis of masculinity, and paradoxical idealization of women and misogyny. We will also consider how literature and films depict these complications in the policies and practices of Nazi Germany's Third Reich and in the suffering and mass murder of Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, and others. Finally, we will discuss and write about the policies and practices of Nazism as challenges to all other categories and theories of race and gender even today.", "name": "Race, Gender, and Sexuality", "section": "20", "topic": "Gender, Race, &amp; the Holocaust", "course": "382-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/GNDR_ST/382-0/12235", "instructor": ["Phyllis B Lassner"], "id": "12235", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Lotus Blossoms, Yellow Fever, Asian Geeks: U.S. popular culture is filled with gendered images of Asian Americans that speak not only about race, but sex. As &quot;model minorities&quot; and &quot;forever foreigners,&quot; Asian and Asian American people are thought to have regressive views on gender roles and sexual norms and identities; these preconceptions make Asian American feminisms and LGBTQ organizing incomprehensible to many. Yet, many Asian Americans may have experienced gendered, sexual, or homophobic violence in their own lives. We will begin this course by reading through the rich writings of Asian American feminism for a historical and theoretical basis. Then, through multidisciplinary scholarship and cultural texts about Asian American genders and sexualities, we will discuss issues including, but not limited to, masculinities, femininities, feminisms, LGBTQ identities in Asian America, interracial and intraracial relationships, dating and marriage, queer of color critique, and families. We will end the course by conducting original interdisciplinary research on social and cultural questions at the intersection of race, gender, and sexuality.", "name": "Race, Gender, and Sexuality", "section": "21", "topic": "Asian Am Gender &amp; Sexualities", "course": "382-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/GNDR_ST/382-0/17198", "instructor": ["Douglas Sadao Ishii"], "id": "17198", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}]
