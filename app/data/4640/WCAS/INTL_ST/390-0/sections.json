From the third session, we will focus on Iranian state-society relations after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the transition to hard-line theocratic governance. From there, we will explore the nature of the Iranian state, concentrating on two of its main characteristics: personalization and militarization. We will additionally consider how the main social groups in Iran's society (the armed forces, the clergy, students, and women), as well as key social spaces such as the bazaar operate in relation to one another and the state. Social media and its simultaneous role in both suppressing and liberating Iranian society will also be a key focal point.
