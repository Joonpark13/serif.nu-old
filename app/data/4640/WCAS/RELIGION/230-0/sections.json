[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will examine core aspects of Judaism and their development from the religion&#39;s biblical beginnings through today. Against the background of Jewish and world history, we will seek to understand the roots and evolution of Jewish rituals, literature, traditions, and beliefs. Judaism and Jewishness have changed so much over the centuries that sometimes this might seem like a course in comparative religion. Our challenge will be to understand why these changes occurred while also identifying the continuities that connect Jews across time and space.", "name": "Introduction to Judaism", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "230-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/RELIGION/230-0/14152", "instructor": ["Claire E Sufrin"], "id": "14152", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
