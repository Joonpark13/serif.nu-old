[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar will give undergraduates the opportunity to reflect critically, thoughtfully, and together with peers, on the question: why go to college? There are many expectations that parents and society place on the college experience. But now that we are in college, how shall we think about it? Is it an experience or is it an education? Is it a ticket to a job or is it the pursuit of knowledge? What do professors do? How is contemporary culture reflected in the university? We address various facets of college life, from diversity and justice to sex and sexism on campus, from the \"party pathway\" to technology. We explore the value of the humanities. We survey the history of the university, investigate its religious origins, and learn about the \"crisis\" of the contemporary university.", "name": "Topics in Christianity", "section": "20", "location": "Crowe 4-130 Rel Studies Sem Rm", "topic": "Why College?", "course": "349-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/RELIGION/349-0/14158", "instructor": ["Christine M Helmer"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "14158", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
