[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course has three main goals: (1) It will provide an introduction to Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Students should gain a basic \"literacy\" in each of these traditions; (2) It will encourage students to become comfortable thinking analytically about religion. The course will discuss how various scholars have understood what religion \"is,\" and explore several lenses through which they analyze it (mythology; ritual, worship and sacred space; prayer and meditation; morality, ethics, and politics; and gender and sexuality); (3) Students will apply their religious literacy, along with their newfound analytic skills to identify similarities, but also differences between and among religious traditions.", "name": "Introduction to Religion", "section": "20", "location": "Fisk Hall 217", "topic": "", "course": "170-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/RELIGION/170-0/14132", "instructor": ["Richard   Kieckhefer"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "14132", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
