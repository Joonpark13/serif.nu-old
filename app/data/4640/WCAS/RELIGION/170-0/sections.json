[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course has three main goals: (1) It will provide an introduction to Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Students should gain a basic &quot;literacy&quot; in each of these traditions; (2) It will encourage students to become comfortable thinking analytically about religion. The course will discuss how various scholars have understood what religion &quot;is,&quot; and explore several lenses through which they analyze it (mythology; ritual, worship and sacred space; prayer and meditation; morality, ethics, and politics; and gender and sexuality); (3) Students will apply their religious literacy, along with their newfound analytic skills to identify similarities, but also differences between and among religious traditions.", "name": "Introduction to Religion", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "170-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/RELIGION/170-0/14132", "instructor": ["Richard   Kieckhefer"], "id": "14132", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
