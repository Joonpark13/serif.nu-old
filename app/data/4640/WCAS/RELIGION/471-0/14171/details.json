And the conflicts among historical subjects can be seen mirrored in debates among modern scholars. Religion in the late medieval West has for some time been vigorously discussed and debated, across disciplinary and sometimes also denominational lines. The most widely respected scholars, such as Eamon Duffy and Caroline Walker Bynum, are not only emulated but also challenged. Theoretical issues sometimes lie at the heart of controversy. Views about the relationship between medieval and Reformation religion continue to generate conflict. More unexpected issues also arise: how precisely to conceive and define heresy; how far literacy and reading habits supported traditional commitment, or when and whether they fostered dissent; how to map the boundaries, if any, separating devotional practice from superstition and magic. Venerable clich\u00e9s about late medieval religion-its emphasis on the humanity of Christ, or its neurotically penitential character-are now much disputed. We will plunge into all these conversations and controversies in an effort to see just why late medieval religion is so controversial. This seminar should be of interest to historians, religionists, art historians, and students of medieval and early modern literature."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "1.
