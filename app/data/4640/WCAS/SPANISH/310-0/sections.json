[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The course will allow students to research in relative depth a topic related to the development of Spanish civilization. To this end, the first part of the course will be devoted to lectures, videos, and the examination of some literary and non-literary Medieval texts in class. The second part of the course will be largely devoted to the presentation of the student research in an oral report that will lead to a paper of no less than 2000 words. The course will examine various aspects of the culture of Spain, from the conquest and domination of most of the land by Rome (218 B.C. to the early fifth century) through the Visigoth domination and kingdom (415 A.D.-711 A.D.), the Muslim invasion and domination (711-1212), and the Christian victory of Navas de Tolosa in 1212 A.D. which led to the re-conquest of most of the territory by the mid thirteenth century with the exception of the Muslim kingdom of Granada (finally conquered in 1492). We will read pages from a cultural history packet, many primary documents, and watch videos and films on Medieval art, culture, and the march of history.", "name": "Origins of Spanish Civilization", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "310-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/SPANISH/310-0/14571", "instructor": ["Dario   Fernandez-Morera"], "id": "14571", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
