[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What is &quot;Jewish&quot; about Argentina? This seems an odd question to ask about a predominantly Catholic Latin American country-even though its small Jewish population is the largest in Latin America and the third largest in the Americas overall. Yet this seemingly homogeneous nation is more multi-ethnic and multi-cultural than one might suppose. Indeed, the story of the Jewish presence in Argentina is a surprising-and yet surprisingly familiar-story. We will explore episodes in this story through works of literature and film that will also push us to think about identity and difference, memory and history, testimony and truth, immigration and assimilation, among other topics. Our close readings and analyses will focus on four writers and one film maker: Alberto Gerchunoff (1884-1950), Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986), Jacobo Timerman (1923-1999), Ana Mar\u00eda Shua (1951- ), and Daniel Burman (1973- ). Secondary materials will include essays and documentary films on history, culture, and literature.", "name": "Topics in Latin American, Latina and Latino, and Iberian Literatures and Cultures", "section": "1", "topic": "Jewish Argentina: From Jewish Gauchos to Contempor", "course": "397-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/SPANISH/397-0/14573", "instructor": ["Lucille   Kerr"], "id": "14573", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
