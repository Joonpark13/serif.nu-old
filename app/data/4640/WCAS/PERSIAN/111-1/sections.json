[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This introductory Persian sequence aims to produce conversational speakers after a single year of study. Emphasis is placed on the modern Tehrani dialect of Persian, but students learn to read, write, and speak more formal Persian as well. The Perso-Arabic alphabet is used from the beginning. In the first quarter students work on pronunciation, become familiar with the script, and internalize introductions and polite phrases. The second quarter introduces new tenses and moods for more complicated language tasks. By the end of the third quarter students will be able to use all common grammatical structures to converse comfortably on a variety of everyday topics.", "name": "Persian I", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "111-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PERSIAN/111-1/13715", "instructor": ["Austin Michael O'Malley"], "id": "13715", "subject": "PERSIAN"}]
