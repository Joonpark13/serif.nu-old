We will not follow a textbook, but rather encounter a variety of authentic written and audio-visual materials, including newspapers, short stories, poems, television series, films, and radio broadcasts. Speaking and writing will be emphasized; each week will involve some combination of written responses, formal presentations, and informal discussion in response to provided materials. By the end of the course students will be comfortable producing language in a variety of registers and modes on familiar topics."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "PERSIAN 111-3 or permission of the instructor"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Saeed Yousef and Hayedeh Torabi, Intermediate Persian: A Grammar and Workbook; a suitable Persian-English dictionary, such as that of Aryanpur-Kashani."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:08 PM (CT)", "subject": "PERSIAN"}]
