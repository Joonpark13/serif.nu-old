[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Since the majority of Persian grammar has been taught in the first year, the intermediate class will focus on the acquisition of vocabulary and language production. We will not follow a textbook, but rather encounter a variety of authentic written and audio-visual materials, including newspapers, short stories, poems, television series, films, and radio broadcasts. Speaking and writing will be emphasized; each week will involve some combination of written responses, formal presentations, and informal discussion in response to provided materials. By the end of the course students will be comfortable producing language in a variety of registers and modes on familiar topics.", "name": "Persian II", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "121-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PERSIAN/121-1/13716", "instructor": ["Austin Michael O'Malley"], "id": "13716", "subject": "PERSIAN"}]
