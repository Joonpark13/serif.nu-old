[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This class will read and discuss selected works of modern Jewish literature in the context of their historical background. We will focus on certain themes and stories in the Bible and in Jewish folklore as well as on particular events and movements in European, American, and Israeli history as a way of better understanding this literature. Though most of this literature dates from the later nineteenth and twentieth centuries up until the present, a study of eighteenth and nineteenth century intellectual and religious currents such as the Enlightenment, Jewish Mysticism, Zionism, and Socialism will help us to understand the literature in its changing historical and social context. Thus while some writers saw modern Jewish literature as a means of educating the masses to modern secular needs, others saw it as a means of reshaping older forms and religious values, while still others saw it as a means of reflecting timeless humanistic concerns. Among the writers we will read are Sholom Aleichem, I. B. Singer, Anzia Yezierska, Primo Levi, Ida Fink, Ava Schieber, Philip Roth, Amos Oz and Shani Boianjiu.", "name": "Modern Jewish Literature", "section": "20", "location": "555 Clark 230", "topic": "", "course": "279-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/JWSH_ST/279-0/13145", "instructor": ["Marcia B Gealy"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "13145", "subject": "JWSH_ST"}]
