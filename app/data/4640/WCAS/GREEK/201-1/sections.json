[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is the first course in the second-year ancient Greek series, designed to transition students into reading unaltered ancient texts while introducing them to some of the most important works written in the language. This first course will cover the Greek of the New Testament, introducing students to the history and idiosyncrasies of the texts, and allowing them their first real opportunity to know an ancient work in the original language. Accordingly this course will focus on the gospel of Mark, the oldest, and shortest, of the gospels, which we will read nearly in its entirety. We will read selections from other gospels as well, to study the relationship between the texts. This course will also serve as a review of the grammar learned in first-year Greek and will include homework and classwork specifically geared toward that end.", "name": "Introduction to Greek Literature", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "201-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/GREEK/201-1/10961", "instructor": ["Ryan Christopher Platte"], "id": "10961", "subject": "GREEK"}]
