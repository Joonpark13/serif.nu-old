[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Physics of stellar interiors and stellar atmospheres. The physical concepts and mathematical theory underlying the internal constitution of stars is described. Their evolution is followed from their birth as protostars to their death as compact objects. the fundamental physical processes involved in the thermodynamic and atomic description of matter as well as the processes involved int he nuclear fusion of matter are presented. Topics to be covered include star formation, prototstellar evolution, main sequence evolution, red giant and asymptotic branch phases, and the structure and evolution of white dwarf and neutron stars.", "name": "Stellar Astrophysics", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "425-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 2:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ASTRON/425-0/17440", "instructor": ["Vasiliki   Kalogera"], "id": "17440", "subject": "ASTRON"}]
