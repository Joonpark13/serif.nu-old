Astronomers used to believe that objects in the Heavens were attached to great crystalline spheres that moved about the Earth with accompanying music. Today, astronomers believe that the Heavens are dominated by a mysterious &quot;dark energy&quot; force that may ultimately tear the universe apart. On top of that, some physicists think that everything from electrons to gravity itself is made of vibrating loops of string-like energy moving through 11-dimensional space. Which is stranger? You decide. We will discuss (in a non-mathematical fashion) how our view of the cosmos has evolved thanks to the work of Galileo, Hubble, Einstein, Schr\u00f6dinger and many others. We will explore not just their ideas, but also the intellectual struggles and the drama behind those ideas."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussions, presentations, and demonstrations.
