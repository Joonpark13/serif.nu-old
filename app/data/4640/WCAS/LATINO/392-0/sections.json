[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will examine the decolonization struggles of oppressed communities in education across various locations and experiences through a social justice perspective. By highlighting the works of scholars, community members, academics and activists - both past and present - and their epistemologies within communities of decolonial struggles, this course will attempt to connect their knowledge production to the historical implications of colonial power and resistance. We will closely discuss and examine social and educational challenges presented to various communities including education reform, school control/decision making, standardization, privatization and multi-cultural education by critically discussing the historical and current purpose of schooling and education. In addition to the examination of these decolonial struggles, we will discuss methods to challenge colonial power dynamics.", "name": "Topics in Latina and Latino Social and Political Issues", "section": "21", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-410", "topic": "Decolonizing Education", "course": "392-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/LATINO/392-0/13152", "instructor": ["Alejandro Eduardo Carrion"], "class_attributes": "Interdisciplinary Distro - See Rules<br/><br/>Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "13152", "subject": "LATINO"}]
