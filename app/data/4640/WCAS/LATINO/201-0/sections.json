[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Latino 201 introduces students to Latino/a studies, to the internal heterogeneity of Latino/a populations, the various ways they are racialized, their negotiations as hybrid subjects, and their struggles to carve a sense of belonging in the U.S. The lectures and readings will introduce students to the different national groups, issues, and social positions that are hidden under the rubric of &quot;Latino.&quot; The course also exposes students to critical concepts needed for future coursework in the field. Topics such as colonialism, the politics of immigration, transnationalism, race, language, social class, gender and sexuality, culture and the arts as sites of resistance, and the forging of Latinidad will also be explored through guest lectures by LLSP faculty members.", "name": "Introduction to Latina and Latino Studies", "section": "35", "topic": "", "course": "201-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/LATINO/201-0/13148", "instructor": ["Ana L Aparicio"], "id": "13148", "subject": "LATINO"}]
