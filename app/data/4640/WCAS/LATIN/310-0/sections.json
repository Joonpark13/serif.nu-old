[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The vortex of Latin literature and, arguably, &quot;the classic of all Europe&quot; (in T.S. Eliot's formulation) Vergil's Aeneid presents itself simultaneously as a poetic mirror of &quot;everything&quot; (the cosmos itself, the place of gods and humans in it) and a meditation on the burden of Rome (?of founding Rome, of being Roman, of opposing Rome). It argues that the world-city is the fulfillment of a divine, cosmic plan, that its hero's burden of administering violence in a savage world is justified by the reward his descendants will reap - of eternally administering an empire won by violence and still threatened by savagery. &quot;Is it all worth it?&quot; We will read and discuss extensive selections of Books 1, 2, 4, and 6 - which is to say, many of the most beautiful and unforgettable words composed in Latin, or any language - to see that our long burden of amo, amas, and amat-ing to greatness, at least, is indeed justified by the burden-reward this poem is.", "name": "Readings in Latin Literature", "section": "1", "topic": "Aeneid, Virgil", "course": "310-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/LATIN/310-0/10929", "instructor": ["John Kyrin Schafer"], "id": "10929", "subject": "LATIN"}]
