[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Students will learn about psychosis, survey popular research approaches, and design research proposals for hypothetical projects. In this class we will learn about major areas of cognitive, emotive, and behavioral dysfunction in schizophrenia as well as related psychotic disorders. We will also survey the most recent developments in the field of intervention, as well as biomarker development in high-risk and premorbid periods. The course will focus heavily on learning about relevant research methodology including eye tracking, motor assessment, psychophysiology, cognitive assessment, and neuroimaging (other modalities will be examined as time permits). This will involve reading about the methodologies and joining the class on a series of field trips to Northwestern Labs (Evanston and Downtown) that are currently employing these approaches.", "name": "Special Topics in Clinical Psychology", "section": "20", "topic": "Research Topics in Schizophrenia", "course": "497-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 9:30AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PSYCH/497-0/10209", "instructor": ["Vijay Anand Mittal"], "id": "10209", "subject": "PSYCH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Health psychology is a field at the interface of behavior and medicine. To conduct and evaluate research in this area, a basic grounding in biology and medicine is necessary. This course will give you such a background. Its goal is to introduce the major biological systems of interest in health psychology, and give you the skills to interpret and conduct research that's done on them. To facilitate this, the course will:<br/> <br/>1. Explore the anatomy and physiology underlying the autonomic, endocrine, cardiac, vascular, and immune systems <br/> <br/>2. Introduce the methods used to measure these systems, and critically evaluate their strengths and weaknesses<br/> <br/>3. Explore theories of etiology for the major diseases studied in the field, which include cancer, infectious, autoimmune, and cardiac conditions<br/> <br/>4. Evaluate the evidence linking psychological characteristics to biological mechanisms and disease outcomes", "name": "Special Topics in Clinical Psychology", "section": "21", "topic": "", "course": "497-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 1:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PSYCH/497-0/10210", "instructor": ["Gregory Evan Miller"], "id": "10210", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
