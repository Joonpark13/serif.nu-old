In addition, it is rare that faculty members perform statistical computations by hand as is done by students in Introductory Statistics classes. Rather, most faculty tend to use - and expect their advanced undergraduate students to use - one of the many computer software packages that are available for this purpose. Thus, this course will have two major foci. First, we will introduce advanced topics not covered in many sections of Introductory Statistics such as Multiple Regression and Factorial Analysis of Variance. Second, we will introduce the student to perhaps the most widely used computer software package in this area, the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).", "qtr": "Fall 2016", "name": "Adv.
