[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an intensive introduction to the scientific study of human personality and is organized around three broad questions: 1) How do people differ? 2) What are the processes and mechanisms underlying these personality differences? 3) What are the implications of these differences in people's lives? In addressing these questions, we will consider both classic and contemporary theoretical and empirical approaches to personality and focus on developing a dynamic understanding of human personality within its biological, social, and cultural contexts.", "name": "Psychology of Personality", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "215-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PSYCH/215-0/10187", "instructor": ["Dan P McAdams"], "id": "10187", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
