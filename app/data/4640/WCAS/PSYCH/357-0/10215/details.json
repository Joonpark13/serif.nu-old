In this class we will learn about major areas of cognitive, emotive, and behavioral dysfunction in schizophrenia as well as related psychotic disorders. We will also survey the most recent developments in the field of intervention, as well as biomarker development in high-risk and premorbid periods. The course will focus heavily on learning about relevant research methodology including eye tracking, motor assessment, psychophysiology, cognitive assessment, and neuroimaging (other modalities will be examined as time permits). This will involve reading about the methodologies and joining the class on a series of field trips to Northwestern Labs (Evanston and Downtown) that are currently employing these approaches."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: Psych 205"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Students will submit written reviews of assigned articles as well as critiques of research modalities.
