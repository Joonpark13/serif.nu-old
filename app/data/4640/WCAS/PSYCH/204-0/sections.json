[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The purpose of this course is to introduce students to important theory, research, and methodologies in social psychology. Social psychology examines how people interpret the social world and the influence of the social environment on individuals' thoughts and behaviors. We will examine classic topics in social psychology: social cognition, social influence, conformity, group processes, interpersonal relationships, helping, aggression, and prejudice. There will be a strong emphasis on methodology and the ways in which study design affects both the research questions one can answer and the conclusions one might draw. Because social psychologists sometimes investigate \"everyday\" behavior, students often believe that they can rely on intuition or common sense to learn about social psychology. Unfortunately, one core finding in social psychology is that common sense can be misleading at best and seriously biased at worst. Thus, this course will focus on how the scientific method helps to provide empirical answers to questions about humans and their social world.", "name": "Social Psychology", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G15", "topic": "", "course": "204-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PSYCH/204-0/10181", "instructor": ["Renee Suzanne Engeln"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "10181", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
