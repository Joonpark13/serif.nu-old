[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This hands-on course will teach you to present your research in a way that is clear, engaging, and memorable, as well as how to improve the presentations of your students and colleagues. Limited to 9 students. Each 3-hour class starts with a short lecture, followed by one student making a 15-minute presentation of their research. The remaining students divide into independent teams of 2-3, and spend the next hour remaking the presentation, in consultation with the presenter and the instructor. Each team will then present their revision for critique and comparison to presentation of the other team, as well as the original.", "name": "Special Topics in Cognition", "section": "20", "topic": "Presenting Your Research", "course": "460-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 9:30AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PSYCH/460-0/10206", "instructor": ["Steven   Franconeri"], "id": "10206", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
