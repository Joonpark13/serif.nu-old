Limited to 9 students. Each 3-hour class starts with a short lecture, followed by one student making a 15-minute presentation of their research. The remaining students divide into independent teams of 2-3, and spend the next hour remaking the presentation, in consultation with the presenter and the instructor. Each team will then present their revision for critique and comparison to presentation of the other team, as well as the original."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:09 PM (CT)", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
