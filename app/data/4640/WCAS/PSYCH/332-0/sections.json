[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is part of the Environmental Policy and Culture program as well as part of a potential WCAS plan to develop an American Indian Studies program. But it also has always been intended as a course in critical thinking. The focus will be on the relationship peoples have with nature, with a particular focus on Native Americans and the environment. The course will also focus on stereotypes, such as that of the &quot;ecological Indian.&quot; Did the colonial powers find a pristine environment when they arrived in America? Did Native Americans have a special spiritual connection with nature? Do Native Americans today also have this same spiritual connection?<br/> One of the books we will read argues that the ecological Indian is a myth. The author, Shepard Krech, suggests that the limiting factor in their impact on the environment was population (there were just too few people to do much damage) and access to technology (which helps do more damage). We'll also examine an edited book written as a response to this book. But the key work will be done by you as you evaluate these arguments, seek additional information and bring out the contemporary relevance of ways of relating to nature.<br/> The course will involve reading, responding to the readings and conducting various mini-research projects bearing on various facets of Native Americans and the Environment. Your final project will consist of a paper consisting of your analysis of these issues which may either take the form of an overview or a focused analysis of one facet or component of these issues.", "name": "Native Americans and Environmental Decision Making", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "332-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PSYCH/332-0/10211", "instructor": ["Douglas L Medin"], "id": "10211", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
