This seminar will instead focus upon the questions asked within the growing science of positive psychology. Does money make us happy, and if so, when and why? How do our relationships contribute to a feeling of meaning in life? What types of situations encourage cognitive mastery and creativity? Can happiness be learned, or is our happiness &quot;setpoint&quot; mostly determined by genetics? How do we, as a society, encourage generosity and altruism? In this seminar, students will read a mix of recent scientific journal articles and book chapters, will write opinion papers about the scientific findings, and will journal about their own experiences in trying to apply these findings to their own lives. Students can expect to wrestle with some of the &quot;big questions&quot; about what makes a good life and a strong society in discussions with their classmates."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: Psychology 110. <br/>If you took this class as a First-Year Seminar, do not enroll in this class."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Students will become familiar with the primary topics and questions of positive psychology, as well as better understand the research methodologies used to scientifically explore these questions."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Class participation; <br/>Discussion; <br/>Lecture; <br/>Readings; <br/>Writing Assignments"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Attendance; <br/>Class participation; <br/>Exam, mid-term; <br/>Homework; <br/>Writing assignments"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "The majority of readings will be scientific articles posted on Canvas."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "P/N option"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:09 PM (CT)", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
