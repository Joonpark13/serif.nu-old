This seminar will instead focus upon the questions asked within the growing science of positive psychology. Does money make us happy, and if so, when and why? How do our relationships contribute to a feeling of meaning in life? What types of situations encourage cognitive mastery and creativity? Can happiness be learned, or is our happiness \"setpoint\" mostly determined by genetics? How do we, as a society, encourage generosity and altruism? In this seminar, students will read a mix of recent scientific journal articles and book chapters, will write opinion papers about the scientific findings, and will journal about their own experiences in trying to apply these findings to their own lives. Students can expect to wrestle with some of the \"big questions\" about what makes a good life and a strong society in discussions with their classmates.", "qtr": "Fall 2016", "name": "Special Topics in Psychology", "title": "WCAS PSYCH 314-0-20 Special Topics in Psychology", "lmod": "10/30/16 7:09 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-4972", "instructor_name": "Wendi L Gardner", "instructor_addr": "Swift Hall 203"}], "topic": "Positive Psychology- The Science of Well-Being", "course": "314-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Psychology has traditionally focused on understanding mental illness, rather than the factors that lead to optimal mental well-being.
