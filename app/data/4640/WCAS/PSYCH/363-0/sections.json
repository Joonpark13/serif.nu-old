[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "New tools allow us to look into the brain to see what happens during thinking. These techniques for imaging brain function are increasingly being used to understand cognitive processes. This course will discuss recent findings from cognitive neuroscience studies that use brain imaging to understand cognitive function. Techniques to be considered will include: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), event related potentials (ERP), positron emission tomography (PET) and the role of structural imaging of the brain in understanding differences in cognitive ability (especially for neuropsychological patients). The primary goal of the course is a basic understanding of what these techniques can tell us about cognitive function in the brain (previous neuroscience experience, although helpful, is not required for this class).", "name": "Images of Cognition", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "363-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PSYCH/363-0/10213", "instructor": ["Paul J Reber"], "id": "10213", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
