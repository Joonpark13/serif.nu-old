[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "An introduction to human perception with a strong emphasis on visual perception. This course evaluates the current understanding of how neural activity in the brain allows people to perceive basic sensory features (e.g., brightness, color, size, position, depth, movement, loudness and pitch) as well as recognize and discriminate complex perceptual patterns (e.g., 2D-shapes, 3D-objects, faces, scenes, and musical sequences). The underlying mechanisms are discussed on the basis of behavioral, neurophysiological, and computational evidence.", "name": "Perception", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "324-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PSYCH/324-0/10197", "instructor": ["Satoru   Suzuki"], "id": "10197", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
