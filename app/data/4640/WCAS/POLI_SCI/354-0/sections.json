[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Comprised of eleven countries, Southeast Asia covers a wide geographical region stretching between India and China. Compared to Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, no world region or grouping is more diverse than Southeast Asia. There are the minor but poor countries of Cambodia and Laos, and the major but poor countries of Indonesia, Burma, the Philippines, and Vietnam. In the middle lie Thailand (with wealth levels comparable to those in Mexico, Turkey, and Brazil) and Malaysia (where average incomes are closer to those found in South Korea). The political systems of the region vary also in form and style. Some are procedurally democratic, some authoritarian (though under civilian rule), and some outright military regimes. This course surveys the political economy of modern Southeast Asia, combining a broad overview of the region's politics with detailed examinations into specific cases and issues. This year's theme is \"oligarchy, democracy, and the rule of law.\" We will touch on the politics of most of the countries in the region, though our main emphasis will be on Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and, to a lesser degree, Vietnam and Thailand.", "name": "Politics of Southeast Asia", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 102", "topic": "", "course": "354-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/POLI_SCI/354-0/12747", "instructor": ["Jeffrey A Winters"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "12747", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
