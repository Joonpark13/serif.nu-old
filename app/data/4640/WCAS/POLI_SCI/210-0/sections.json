[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course provides an introduction to the empirical methods political scientists use to answer questions about politics, and the reasons why such methods matter. After exploring how hard it is to make good descriptive and causal inferences about politics, we will examine three basic strategies for overcoming the obstacles to reliable knowledge about the political world: experimentation, large N or quantitative studies (AKA statistics), and small N studies that use qualitative reasoning. This class fulfills the political science department methods requirement.", "name": "Introduction to Empirical Methods in Political Science", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "210-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/POLI_SCI/210-0/12909", "instructor": ["Jason W Seawright"], "id": "12909", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
