The first is to introduce students to some of the basic theories of comparative politics. The second is to teach students how to think like political scientists. This means that they will become familiar with the rules of causal inference, the ways that we can prove that one phenomenon causes another. By the end of the course, they will be able to both critically evaluate the causal arguments of others and construct their own causal arguments."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and Discussion Sections"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Midterm and Final, Short Exercises, Discussion"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Tentative:<br/>Course packet<br/>Arend Lijphart, Patterns of Democracy (Yale UP), 978-0300078930"}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/POLI_SCI/250-0/17597", "instructor": ["Andrew L Roberts"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "17597", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}, {"class_mtg_info": [{"meet_t": "MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM", "meet_l": "Parkes Hall 213"}], "school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "", "qtr": "Fall 2016", "name": "Introduction to Comparative Politics", "title": "WCAS POLI_SCI 250-0-21 Introduction to Comparative Politics", "lmod": "10/30/16 7:08 PM (CT)", "section": "21", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Moses   Khisa", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "250-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/POLI_SCI/250-0/18304", "instructor": ["Moses   Khisa"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "18304", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
