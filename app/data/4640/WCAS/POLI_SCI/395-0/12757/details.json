We consider specific cases in cities such as Ferguson, Missouri, New York City, Chicago, and Atlanta to explore mobilization, political and civic engagement, contests for political representation, coalition building, democratic responsiveness, and patterns of socioeconomic mobility and inequality. Our overarching aim will be to understand how these two dominant features of American urban life-race and place-interplay and shape the quest for political power, policy influence, and socioeconomic advancement in American cities."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Juniors/Seniors"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "By the end of the course, students should have a deeper appreciation and understanding of how race and place matter in American urban politics."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar.
