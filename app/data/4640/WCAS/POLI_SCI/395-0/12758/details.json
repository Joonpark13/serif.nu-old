Tremendous concentrations of power in the hands of small segments of society continue even after major democratic gains have been won. This seminar will focus on oligarchs, who are empowered by tremendous wealth, as well as elites who are empowered in non-material ways. How are these actors defined and what are the different forms of oligarchic and elite power across countries and historical periods?
