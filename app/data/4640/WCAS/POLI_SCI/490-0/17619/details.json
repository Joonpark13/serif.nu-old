Whereas the former will make you a better colleague to fellow social scientists, the latter improves your job prospects (and get you colleagues to begin with). Based on the potential outcomes framework, this class will introduce students to qualitative and quantitative techniques<br/>that enable researchers to isolate causal effects. It will force students to move beyond &quot;naive&quot; regression and case study designs and explore how &quot;less na\u00efve&quot; combinations of both methods can strengthen our confidence in causal claims. It does this by emphasizing the importance of research design and making explicit the assumptions underlying causal arguments."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "This course will have required books/other materials.<br/><br/>Thad Dunning (2012) Natural Experiments in the Social Sciences: A design based<br/>Approach.
