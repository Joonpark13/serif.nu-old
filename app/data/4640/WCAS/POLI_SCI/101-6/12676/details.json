Topics include historical and contemporary women's movements, issues concerning the political representation of women, barriers to women seeking office, and the role of gender stereotypes in campaigns and elections. Throughout the course we attend to the intersections of gender with other identities such as race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, and nativity and highlight, in particular, the participation and contributions of women of color. In addition, while this course concentrates on women as political actors in the United States, we briefly examine women's participation and representation in comparative perspective."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "TBD, contact the Professor directly for more information"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:08 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
