The AthPol is a short text that tells the story of Athenian political development and, in conclusion, delivers a detailed description of the Athenian constitution (politeia) of Aristotle's own time. Its thesis is that over the course of centuries marked by popular unrest, brilliant and dull leadership, institutional innovations, oligarchic coups, persistent war and corrosive factionalism, Athens decisively became increasingly &quot;more democratic.&quot; In this course we will explore the argument of this text together with Aristotle's political theory elaborated in the Politics."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Contact the instructor directly for more information."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:09 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
