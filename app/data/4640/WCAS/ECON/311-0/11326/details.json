The course begins with a review of national income accounting and elementary income determination. We then analyze the critical determinants of growth and address the issue of what, if anything, can be done to encourage poor economies to develop. We then study the determinants of modern business cycles, unemployment and inflation. After developing an analytic framework to analyze these phenomena, we examine the role and consequences of monetary and fiscal policy."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Econ 201 and 202"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lectures and TA session"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Homeworks (10-20%), two midterms (20-25% each) and a final exam (40%)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Macroeconomics by Mankiw, 9th edition (ISBN-10: 1464182892; ISBN-13: 978-1464182891)"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:03 PM (CT)", "subject": "ECON"}]
