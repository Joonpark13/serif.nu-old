[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines why many countries are less economically developed and the implications for individuals' well-being in these countries. The emphasis will be on microeconomic issues. We will ask such questions as &quot;Do the poor under-invest in education and health?&quot; and &quot;What types of public policies can be used to improve the well-being of people living in developing countries?&quot; Other topics include microfinance, informal insurance, corruption, and the productivity of firms in developing countries. An important objective is to learn how to use both the theoretical and empirical tools of economics to investigate the questions above. Therefore, econometric techniques and theoretical models will feature prominently in the course.", "name": "The Economics of Developing Countries", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "326-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ECON/326-0/11371", "instructor": ["Seema   Jayachandran"], "id": "11371", "subject": "ECON"}]
