We will learn about economic decisions that individuals and households face from a unique gender perspective and ask ourselves: do women and men behave differently in economic circumstances? The topics we will cover include, among others: the status of women around the world, education, marriage, fertility, labor supply, bargaining power, and discrimination. For each topic, we will study concrete examples emanating from all over the world. Students will learn to use a wide variety of academic and not-so-academic resources (including empirical research articles, ethnographic descriptions, and popular press books)."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Two 80-minute classes per week.
