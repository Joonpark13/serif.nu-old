[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "An important practical objective of empirical economic research is to predict the consequences of alternative public policies. Economists combine data with assumptions to draw conclusions about policy impacts. The strength and credibility of these conclusions depend on the data and assumptions brought to bear, as well as on the analytical methods used. This course will study basic methodological problems in policy analysis and examine how economists perform policy analysis in practice. The methodological discussion will place special emphasis on problems of extrapolation that arise whenever one attempts to evaluate policies that differ from the status quo. The discussion of practice will examine actual research analyzing a range of policy questions.", "name": "Analytic Methods for Public Policy Analysis", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L07", "topic": "", "course": "336-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ECON/336-0/11338", "instructor": ["Charles   Manski"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "11338", "subject": "ECON"}]
