This course uses microeconomic theory to acquaint students with various aspects of the subnational government sector, including expenditure, financing, and policy issues. We start by reviewing under what situation is the government provision desirable. We then study how levels of state goods and services are determined using voting and Tiebout models. After discussing user charges and intergovernmental grants, we will explore the main source of state and local governmental revenue: taxes. The course will end with policy analysis and application in education, health and welfare."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Economics 310-1"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Twice weekly lectures, one hour and twenty minutes each."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Grades will be based on problem sets, two midterm exams, and a final exam."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "<i>State and Local Public Finance</i> by Fisher, 4th edition (ISBN-13: 978-0765644275)"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:03 PM (CT)", "subject": "ECON"}]
