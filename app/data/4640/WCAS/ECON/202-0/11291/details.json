Informally, economics helps us understand how household, business and government decision makers respond to incentives; the importance of proper-functioning markets in a modern capitalist economy; and the role of government in alleviating various market failures. Microeconomics focuses on individual decisions (typically using cost-benefit analysis) and the inner workings of specific markets. Picking up where macroeconomics left off, this course will introduce the principles of microeconomics and teach you how to apply these concepts to real world scenarios. Thus, this course is aimed not only at potential economics majors, but also at any student who desires the ability to understand the popular press, critically analyze government policies, and use microeconomics to make better choices as a consumer, producer, representative, or voter."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Econ 201, or confidence applying high school algebra tools (graphs, equations, and tables)"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "A typical week features three lectures and a discussion section."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "In-class poll questions, weekly online quizzes, 5 problem sets, 2 midterm exams, final exam"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "<i>Modern Principles: Microeconomics</i> (looseleaf text + LaunchPad access card) by Cowen, 3rd Edition (ISBN: 978-1319036065)<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>OR</b><br/><i>Modern Principles: Microeconomics</i> (LaunchPad access card only) by Cowen, 3rd Edition (ISBN: 978-1464145377)"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:03 PM (CT)", "subject": "ECON"}]
