Informally, economics helps us understand how household, business and government decision makers respond to incentives; the importance of proper-functioning markets in a modern capitalist economy; and the role of government in alleviating various market failures. Microeconomics focuses on individual decisions (typically using cost-benefit analysis) and the inner workings of specific markets. Picking up where macroeconomics left off, this course will introduce the principles of microeconomics and teach you how to apply these concepts to real world scenarios. Thus, this course is aimed not only at potential economics majors, but also at any student who desires the ability to understand the popular press, critically analyze government policies, and use microeconomics to make better choices as a consumer, producer, representative, or voter.", "qtr": "Fall 2016", "name": "Introduction to Microeconomics", "title": "WCAS ECON 202-0-20 Introduction to Microeconomics", "lmod": "10/30/16 7:03 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Laura Lynne Kiesling", "instructor_addr": ""}], "associated_classes": [{"component": "DIS", "room": "Loder Hall Lower Level 023", "meeting_time": "Mo 4:00PM - 4:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "Loder Hall Lower Level 023", "meeting_time": "We 4:00PM - 4:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "Locy Hall 111", "meeting_time": "Mo 4:00PM - 4:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "555 Clark B03", "meeting_time": "We 4:00PM - 4:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "Locy Hall 214", "meeting_time": "Mo 5:00PM - 5:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "University Hall 101", "meeting_time": "We 5:00PM - 5:50PM"}], "topic": "", "course": "202-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Formally, economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among competing ends.
