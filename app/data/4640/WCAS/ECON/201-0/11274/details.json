The first three weeks cover aspects of general microeconomics that everyone should know, including how the market system works, how prices are determined, why shortages and surpluses occur, and basic industrial competition. Topics include: supply and demand, competition versus monopoly, comparative advantage in trade, taxation, and market failures. The last two-thirds of the class build on these tools to study the behavior of the economy as a whole, particularly in an international context. Topics include: inflation, unemployment, recessions, booms, fiscal and monetary policy, budget deficits, economic development of nations, international trade, and exchange rates."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "The class requires high school level algebra and the interpretation and use of graphs."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Three 50 minute lectures and one fifty minute TA section per week."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Two midterms (worth 15% and 30%), weekly quizzes (10%) and a final exam (45%)."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "1.
