[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This class will examine the most fundamental ideas in physics, including those from classical physics, quantum mechanics, Einstein's relativity, nuclear physics, the latest notions in cosmology, and much more. Emphasis will be placed on how these ideas fit into a historical context. We will study the subject from the &quot;ground up&quot; - no prior physics education is needed. Students should be comfortable with simple algebra.", "name": "Ideas of Physics", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "103-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 9:00AM - 9:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PHYSICS/103-0/17772", "instructor": ["Shane Louis Larson"], "id": "17772", "subject": "PHYSICS"}]
