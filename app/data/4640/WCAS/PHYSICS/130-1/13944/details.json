Physics is the most basic of the sciences, dealing with the behavior and structure of matter. Lectures illustrate physical principles: mechanics, motion, momentum and energy, and fluids. Continues as PHYSICS 130-2, 3. Students taking this course must also enroll concurrently in Physics Lab 136-1. Actual demonstrations of many physical principles will be shown in the lecture when ever possible. The goal of the course is for the student to gain an understanding of the nature of the physical principles which govern the world around us and the universe beyond, through models which draw on our everyday experiences. <br/><br/>Topics:<br/>1.
