[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This two-course sequence is designed to introduce the skill set required to do physical calculations, using examples drawn from common physics topics. The goal is to develop the ability to calculate efficiently, accurately and quickly, without excessive emphasis on mathematical rigor. The first quarter covers the practical aspects of integral calculus, Infinite series, complex variables, matrices and vector spaces. The second quarter covers probability distributions, differential equations, Fourier analysis, and basics of PDEs.", "name": "Mathematical Tools for Physical Sciences", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "211-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 12:00PM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PHYSICS/211-1/17454", "instructor": ["Jens   Koch"], "id": "17454", "subject": "PHYSICS"}]
