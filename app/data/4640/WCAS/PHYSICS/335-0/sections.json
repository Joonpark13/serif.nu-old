[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will use magic tricks, illusion, and deception to discuss the rarely explored but often surprisingly flexible boundaries of what is physically possible. The topics to be considered include: discerning the skills of the performer versus concealed science; the identification of unconscious assumptions; mathematical, statistical, geometrical, and classical mechanical effects that challenge intuition; phenomena involving metamaterials, complex systems, and chaos; physics of optical illusions, levitation, and cloaking; effects in fluid dynamical, electromagnetic, and quantum mechanical systems; misconceptions and apparent paradoxes.", "name": "Modern Physics for Nonmajors", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "335-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 2:00PM - 3:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PHYSICS/335-0/17493", "instructor": ["Adilson E Motter"], "id": "17493", "subject": "PHYSICS"}]
