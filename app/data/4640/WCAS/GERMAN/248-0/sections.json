[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "With the so-called refugee crisis currently re-defining Europe's self-perception, Germany is very much in the focus of global attention: The government's decision to accommodate more than a million refugees in 2015 met praise and criticism alike, both inside and outside of Germany. The influx of hundreds of thousands of people from Syria, Afghanistan, and other countries has given new urgency to questions of what immigration and a diverse population means for Germany and how practices and policies have to change. The class will follow and analyze these discussions from a historical standpoint so that students are better able to evaluate German positions on immigration, citizenship, and diversity today. In addition, students will be asked to compare their findings with the situation in the US in the past and today to gain a deeper understanding of the issues involved and develop a nuanced understanding of both societies.", "name": "Learning Diversity: Germany and Global Migration", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-410", "topic": "", "course": "248-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/GERMAN/248-0/17540", "instructor": ["Jan   Behrs"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "17540", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
