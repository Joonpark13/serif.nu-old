[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course takes its point of departure from two sayings: &quot;there are no facts, only interpretations&quot; (Nietzsche), and &quot;Only here is suffering suffering&quot; (Kafka). It explores the relationship between suffering and interpretation. For Nietzsche, the interpretation of suffering - real or imagined - is not only the origin of all moral and legal categories but also the source of philosophical speculation. For many of the characters that inhabit Kafka`s fictions, suffering - real or imagined - generates interminable interpretations, and the interminability of interpretation is itself the source of intensified suffering. In the first part of the course the students will read short sections from Nietzsche`s &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; and the entirety of his &quot;Genealogy of Morals.&quot; In the second, students will be exposed to a series of Kafka stories, a collection of his aphorisms, and his great unfinished novel, &quot;The Castle.&quot;", "name": "Kafka and Nietzsche", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "236-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/GERMAN/236-0/12258", "instructor": ["Peter D Fenves"], "id": "12258", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
