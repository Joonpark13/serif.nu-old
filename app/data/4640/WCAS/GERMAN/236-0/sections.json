[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course takes its point of departure from two sayings: \"there are no facts, only interpretations\" (Nietzsche), and \"Only here is suffering suffering\" (Kafka). It explores the relationship between suffering and interpretation. For Nietzsche, the interpretation of suffering - real or imagined - is not only the origin of all moral and legal categories but also the source of philosophical speculation. For many of the characters that inhabit Kafka`s fictions, suffering - real or imagined - generates interminable interpretations, and the interminability of interpretation is itself the source of intensified suffering. In the first part of the course the students will read short sections from Nietzsche`s \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" and the entirety of his \"Genealogy of Morals.\" In the second, students will be exposed to a series of Kafka stories, a collection of his aphorisms, and his great unfinished novel, \"The Castle.\"", "name": "Kafka and Nietzsche", "section": "20", "location": "Fisk Hall 217", "topic": "", "course": "236-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/GERMAN/236-0/12258", "instructor": ["Peter D Fenves"], "class_attributes": "Interdisciplinary Distro - See Rules<br/><br/>Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "12258", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
