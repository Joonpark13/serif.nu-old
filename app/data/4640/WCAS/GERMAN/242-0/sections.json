[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "No prior knowledge of Jewish culture or history is required for this class (though if students have such that is great!) and the course is of equal interest to Jews and non-Jews.<br/><br/>The first three decades of the twentieth century witnessed an unprecedented renaissance in secular modern Jewish culture. One of the hallmarks of this renaissance was the dynamic artistic and intellectual interaction between young German and German-speaking Jews with their counterparts in Eastern Europe. Kafka discovered the Hasidic tales of Nahman of Bratslav. Martin Buber drew the world's attention to the vibrant mystical culture of Eastern European Jews. Golems (man-made men) and Dibbuks (demonic possessors) began to appear in the leading theatres of Europe. Marc Chagall stormed the art worlds of Berlin and Paris with his bizarre avant-garde representations of Eastern European Jewish life on canvas. Gustav Mahler incorporated Jewish folksong into his symphonies.<br/><br/>We examine all of these figures and others in this course. Thus students will be introduced both to key Jewish writers in German?Franz Kafka, Gershom Scholem, Walter Benjamin and others?and the leading writers of modern Yiddish literature?Mendele the Bookseller, Sholem Aleichem, Y.L. Peretz and others.<br/><br/>Guest speakers, all leading scholars in their fields at this university, may provide us with presentations.<br/><br/>Great emphasis is placed on student participation in all class discussions. Two students will be assigned to provide an informal class presentation together for one session a quarter.", "name": "Imagining Modern Jewish Culture in Yiddish and German", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "242-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/GERMAN/242-0/12278", "instructor": ["Marcus G Moseley"], "id": "12278", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
