[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Everybody who has been to Germany knows that Germans are obsessed with crime stories: &quot;Tatort&quot;, the weekly TV series that has 20 teams of investigators solve crimes all over the country, is widely seen as a symbol for the federal republic with all its strengths and weaknesses, and the bestseller lists are brimming over with detective stories of all kind. We will definitely watch some &quot;Tatort&quot; and read some contemporary crime fiction, but we will also try to gain some historical insight: From Friedrich Schiller`s &quot;Verbrecher aus verlorener Ehre&quot; (Criminal of Lost Honor) to GDR movies concerned with a crimeless socialist society, from Theodor Fontane`s realist novella &quot;Unterm Birnbaum&quot; (Under the Pear Tree) to classics of cinematic history like Fritz Lang`s &quot;M&quot;, artists have again and again revisited tropes of crime, punishment, guilt and social reintegration. How has the discourse regarding these topics changed over the centuries? Is there a specifically German take on crime? And what do these cops-and-robbers stories tell us about society in general?", "name": "Special Topics in German Literature and Culture", "section": "20", "topic": "Criminal Stories", "course": "245-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/GERMAN/245-0/12257", "instructor": ["Jan   Behrs"], "id": "12257", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
