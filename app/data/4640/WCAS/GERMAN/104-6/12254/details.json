Since its origin in the ethnographic writings of the enlightenment in the 17th and 18th century, the fetish appears in many different incarnations in such heterogeneous discourses as theology, Marxism, sociology, psychoanalysis, the clinical psychiatry of sexual deviance, modernist aesthetics, popular culture, and anthropology. This class will give a historical survey of these transformations by focusing on crucial representations of the fetish, fetishism and the fetishist in literature (Sacher-Masoch, Hoffmann), philosophy (Marx, Adorno, Benjamin), psychoanalysis (Freud) and film (Lynch, Cronenberg, Farocki)."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Knowledge of developments in psychology, ethnology, political economy.<br/>Knowledge of modern art, film, literature<br/>Improved writing skills"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Class participationDiscussionFilms / videosLecturePresentationsReadingsSeminarWriting assignments"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendanceClass participationHomeworkPaper, mid-termPapersPresentationsProject, final"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Leopold von Sacher-Masoch: Venus in Furs (Penguin Edition)<br/>ASIN: B004MR3TPU<br/><br/>All other materials will be provided as a course reader"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:05 PM (CT)", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
