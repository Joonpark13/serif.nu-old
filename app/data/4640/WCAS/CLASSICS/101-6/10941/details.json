Yet that familiarity marks precisely the reason we are likely to be mistaken about it, even (especially?) in our own time and place (quick test: does the phrase &quot;what we mean by love&quot; sound perfectly clear to you?). In this class we will question &quot;our&quot; received ideas about love (whatever those are) by observing a cluster of Roman authors (Vergil, Ovid, Catullus, and others) questioning theirs - and by questioning their questioning in turn. Reading and discussing their works in English translation, we will see what happens when we treat what is strangest and most foreign about them as the easy part, and the easy part as the problem."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendanceClass participationPapersReadings"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Propertius: The Poems (Oxford World's Classics) <br/>Guy Lee, translator<br/>ISBN-13: 978-0199555925<br/>ISBN-10: 0199555923<br/>Price: $5-15 used/new<br/><br/>Catullus: The complete poems <br/>(Oxford World's Classics) 1st Edition<br/>Guy Lee (translator)<br/>ISBN-13: 978-0199537570<br/>ISBN-10: 0199537577<br/>Price: $3-15 used/new<br/><br/>Ovid: The Love Poems (Oxford World's Classics) 1st Edition<br/>A.
