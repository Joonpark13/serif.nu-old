We will begin by studying Greek myth broadly, focusing on our very earliest texts, and then gradually narrow our focus to mythology in Classical Athens. The legacy of Greek mythology is timeless yet the myths themselves grew out of unique times and a unique culture so we will work to understand these myths within their original contexts, yet we will also keep our eye on uses of Greek mythology in the modern world, including in contemporary Chicago."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "None"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and discussion section"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "participation (including completion of assigned readings), midterm, final, short writing assignments."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Trzaskoma, Stephen and Smith, R.
