[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course starts with the Greeks' invention of law and the development of early law (including texts such as Homer), to focus on the laws and legal system of democratic Athens. We shall analyze courtroom speeches by Demosthenes, Plato, and others. Topics include Athens' laws of homicide, assault, libel, and hubris, and various courtroom strategies such as litigants' exploitation of legal procedures. We close with an examination of the scope of Greek law (especially, what matters were left unregulated), and the laws of strange societies (such as Sparta).", "name": "Greek and Roman History", "section": "1", "topic": "Origins of Law in Ancient Greece", "course": "320-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/CLASSICS/320-0/10976", "instructor": ["Robert W Wallace"], "id": "10976", "subject": "CLASSICS"}]
