We shall analyze courtroom speeches by Demosthenes, Plato, and others. Topics include Athens' laws of homicide, assault, libel, and hubris, and various courtroom strategies such as litigants' exploitation of legal procedures. We close with an examination of the scope of Greek law (especially, what matters were left unregulated), and the laws of strange societies (such as Sparta)."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "mid-term, short final, and several mini-essays"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "D.
