[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Although the ancient Romans never made it to the new world, their legacy in Chicago is reflected in architecture, the visual arts, and sites devoted to recreation, education, politics, and business. This class will journey to Chicago's financial district, political and commercial core, cultural institutions, hotels, theaters, parks, schools, cemeteries, and ethnic neighborhoods. By walking the city, you will learn to &quot;read&quot; the streets, buildings, and monuments that showcase Chicago's engagement with the classical past. You will also learn how to use digital tools and practices - such as video editing, data analysis, and digital mapping - to produce an innovative and collaborative virtual walking tour mapping Chicago's ongoing dialogue with Roman antiquity.", "name": "Topics in Greco-Roman Civilization", "section": "1", "topic": "Ancient Rome in Chicago", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 3:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/CLASSICS/390-0/10947", "instructor": ["Francesca   Tataranni"], "id": "10947", "subject": "CLASSICS"}]
