[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What does morality require of us? Does acting morally amount to consistently bringing about the best consequences that we can? Or are there other important considerations that we should take into account when thinking about how to act well? When we are trying to figure out how to act, what questions should we be asking ourselves? Drawing on both classic and contemporary readings in philosophy, as well as our own experiences, we will ask what it means to live a moral life in different spheres and situations. Do we have, or can we justify, special obligations to our friends and family? Do our professional and other roles shape what we have reason to do? How do we understand our obligations towards strangers? Is there some unified way to understand the reasons that should guide us in all of these spheres, or do they operate independently?", "name": "The Brady Scholars Program", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 4-410", "topic": "The Moral Life", "course": "273-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PHIL/273-2/13895", "instructor": ["Kyla Sue Ebels Duggan"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "13895", "subject": "PHIL"}]
