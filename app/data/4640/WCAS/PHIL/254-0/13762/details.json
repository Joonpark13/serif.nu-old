From a reflection on methodological questions, it will approach the question of realism. We will be guided by nested &quot;what does it take&quot;-questions. For example: What does it take for a system of sentences to count as a good scientific theory? What does it take for a scientific theory to be testable by observational and experimental data (and, by the way: what does it take for certain series of experiences to count as data or observations?)? What does it take for a given theory to be better supported by the available evidence than its competitors? What does it take for a given theory to explain the known phenomena in an area of knowledge? What does it take for an explanatory scientific theory to be credited with reference to underlying structures of reality? We will begin with a brief overview of the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17 th century, and then turn to the treatment of certain problems in the contemporary literature, like the problem of induction, the problem of the underdetermination of theory choice by the available data, the problem of rationality and conceptual change, the problem of realism."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "None."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Having worked through the materials offered, students will...<br/>-be competent in the major paradigms and revolutions behind contemporary natural science<br/>-be able to identify, discuss and appreciate foundations of advanced scientific theories that use vocabulary referring to entities not observable by the human perceptual equipment<br/>-be able to conduct a formally correct argument articulating methodological and/or ontological and/or evaluative aspects of scientific work<br/>-Have gained an appreciation of the deep reach of human factors in scientific practice (like background understandings, relevance constraints, comparative judgments) of even the natural sciences, and thereby have acquired a sophisticated concept of scientific objectivity."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "PARTICIPATION:<br/>-Discussion in class, but mainly participation in sections.<br/><br/>WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS:<br/>-1 1400-word short papers (&quot;Midterm&quot;)<br/>-1 3000-word final research paper.<br/><br/>PROPORTION (rule of thumb): Participation: 22% (of which your contribution to in-class-discussion counts 30%, to sections ~70%) + Short Paper 30% + Final Paper 48%."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Required Books: <br/>-Godfrey-Smith, Peter: Theory and Reality, Chicago: Chicago UP, 2003.<br/>-Ladyman, James: Understanding Philosophy of Science, London/NY: Routledge, 2002.<br/><br/>Required Additional Readings available in pdf at Canvas."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:08 PM (CT)", "subject": "PHIL"}]
