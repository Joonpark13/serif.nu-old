Milton's defenses of political, personal, and religious liberty, his self-presentation, and his grappling with key ethical questions - involving free will, gender definitions, crime, authority, rebellion and redemption - will be among the many concerns that arise as we explore his work in the context of the raging political and theological controversies of his time."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "permission of department required"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "permission of department required"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:04 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
