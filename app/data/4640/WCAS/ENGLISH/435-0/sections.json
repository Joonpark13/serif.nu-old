[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "We will study John Milton's poetry and prose in context, with sustained attention to the crisis of his times, the subtlety of his thought, the complexities of his art, and the extent of his influence. Milton's defenses of political, personal, and religious liberty, his self-presentation, and his grappling with key ethical questions - involving free will, gender definitions, crime, authority, rebellion and redemption - will be among the many concerns that arise as we explore his work in the context of the raging political and theological controversies of his time.", "name": "Studies in 17Th Century Literature", "section": "20", "topic": "Milton", "course": "435-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 2:00PM - 5:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ENGLISH/435-0/12019", "instructor": ["Regina M Schwartz"], "id": "12019", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
