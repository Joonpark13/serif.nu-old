How is impulse connected to issues of form and genre? What are the elements of style, and how might they be manipulated to produce original, exciting works of literary art? This course will explore the roles of impulse and style in writing, and how they may manifest differently across genres. Along the way, you'll develop your own sense of aesthetic value, and observe and measure this value in literary texts, including the work of classmates. You'll be encouraged to see yourself as an active member of a community of artists, and to develop a regular discipline as a working writer. Writing will be due in nearly every class, and peer workshops will play an important role in learning to see your work more objectively."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "This course is open to first-year students only."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:04 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
