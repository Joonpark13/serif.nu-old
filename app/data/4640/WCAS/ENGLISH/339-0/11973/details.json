In this course, we will investigate ways that Shakespeare uses these themes to explore critical social issues in the Renaissance - the nature of monarchy, good government, gender roles, race, and the supernatural. How is performance associated with supposedly &quot;unruly&quot; elements in the culture (tavern crowds, racial others, upstart women) but also with the actions of monarchs and good rulers? What dangers and pleasures did &quot;playing&quot; offer Renaissance audiences? We will also consider ways that Shakespeare's works speak to contemporary issues as they travelled into new time periods and cultures, including our own Chicago, which is hosting 850 events for the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death. We will read five plays in the context of historical materials, criticism, and modern films; and we will attend one local performance."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture &amp; discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "TBA."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Merchant of Venice, Othello, Macbeth, The Hollow Crown, The Maori Merchant of Venice, and O."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:04 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
