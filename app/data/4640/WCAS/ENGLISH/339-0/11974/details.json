As the massive festivals in his honor occurring around the world all year long would attest, &quot;The Bard&quot; may be lone gone but is hardly forgotten. What makes Shakespeare's work so appealing to modern audiences? How has it been adapted to fit today's globalized and ever-changing world? This course aims to answer these questions by examining Shakespeare in a modern context. From an updated film version of The Tempest that imagines Prospero as an overbearing mother (Helen Mirren), to West Side Story's race-conscious adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, to Key &amp; Peele's satirical take on Othello, we will explore how modern readers, writers, theater directors, film-makers, and other &quot;Bardolotors&quot; make Shakespeare's work relevant for present-day audiences. Throughout the course we will consider the reception (and ongoing revision) of Shakespeare's legacy; Shakespearean productions in a global context; translation and adaptation; and Shakespeare in modern media (including film, social media, and TV). Students will have the opportunity to attend a live performance, and to stage an in-class performance of their own."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar discussion and occasional short lectures."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Regular short writing assignments; in-class performance and write-up; final paper; class participation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Romeo and Juliet, West Side Story, Zeffirelli film, Baz Luhrmann film, Taylor Swift, Lana Del Ray; Shakespeare in Love, Othello, Q Brothers' Othello: The Remix (produced by Chicago Shakespeare Theater); O (film starring Mekhi Phifer and Julia Stiles), Catch My Soul (1974 film), Key &amp; Peele &quot;Othello&quot; skit,<br/>The Tempest (Julie Taymor's film starring Helen Mirren and Djimon Hounsou), Margaret Atwood's novel Hag-Seed (forthcoming in 2016); Shakespeare Behind Bars (documentary film)."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Instructor Bio: Rebecca Fall's primary research and teaching interests concern the history of nonsense writing, foolish speech, and silly jokes, especially as they relate to the popular culture and media of the English Renaissance. She also studies and teaches about modern-day adaptations of Medieval and Renaissance texts, as well as the history of gender and sexuality. Most of all, Dr. Fall is interested in exploring how pre-modern literature can help us understand the world today. She has worked as a PreAmble Scholar at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater since 2014."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:04 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
