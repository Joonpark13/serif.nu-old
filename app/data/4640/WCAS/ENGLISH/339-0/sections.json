From an updated film version of The Tempest that imagines Prospero as an overbearing mother (Helen Mirren), to West Side Story's race-conscious adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, to Key & Peele's satirical take on Othello, we will explore how modern readers, writers, theater directors, film-makers, and other \"Bardolotors\" make Shakespeare's work relevant for present-day audiences. Throughout the course we will consider the reception (and ongoing revision) of Shakespeare's legacy; Shakespearean productions in a global context; translation and adaptation; and Shakespeare in modern media (including film, social media, and TV).
