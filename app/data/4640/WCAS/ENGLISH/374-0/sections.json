[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Louise Erdrich is perhaps the best known contemporary Native American writer?her books have won the National Book Award and the National Book Critics award, among others; her stories and poetry are frequently anthologized and adopted in book clubs.\u00a0 Winona La Duke was a vice presidential candidate in 1996 and 2000; her environmental activism and writing take up issues from fracking to mining in contexts of tribal sovereignty.\u00a0 Yet Erdrich and La Duke are part of a long history of Native American literary expression from the Great Lakes region where they live and about which they write.\u00a0 This course will read Erdrich's novels, poetry, and short stories and La Duke's environmental writings alongside their literary ancestors and contemporary Native American authors who cite their influences.\u00a0 We will focus in particular on how questions of place and history are central to writing from the Great Lakes, and we will investigate how Native American writers take up these questions in the context of dispossession, forced removal, and ecological catastrophe.\u00a0 This course will very probably include a trip to hear La Duke speak in Chicago.", "name": "Topics in Native American and Indigenous Literatures", "section": "20", "location": "Parkes Hall 223", "topic": "Louise Erdrich, Winona La Duke, & Great Lakes NA W", "course": "374-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ENGLISH/374-0/12111", "instructor": ["Kelly E Wisecup"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "12111", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
