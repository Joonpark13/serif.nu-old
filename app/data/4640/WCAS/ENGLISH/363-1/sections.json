[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course explores recurring motifs in Edwardian (1901-10) fiction and a generation beyond, providing a clear introduction to British modernism. Through detailed examination of relevant, fascinating works by writers such as Conrad, Forster, Joyce, Mansfield, Lawrence, and Woolf, as well as poets such as Owen and Sassoon, we will study the cultural and literary shift from naturalism to post-impressionism, as well as other formal changes in British fiction that these writers tied to the First World War and its catastrophic effects. We will also trace comparable arguments in painting and aesthetics, and examine related social and cultural preoccupations of the time. Among these were conceptions of privacy, personhood, and psychology, as well as widespread concerns about rural change, urban decay, national cohesion, military conflict, and the ends of imperialism.", "name": "20th-Century Fiction", "section": "20", "location": "Parkes Hall 223", "topic": "Modern British Fiction and the First World War", "course": "363-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ENGLISH/363-1/11977", "instructor": ["Christopher   Lane"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "11977", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
