But is anything different about these phenomena in our digital age? For instance, since it's so easy to copy and remix digital data, do we do so more often? Do people feel pressure to make things up because they must produce content more frequently, faster, and across more platforms than ever before? Do technology and its crowd-sourcing capabilities render lies and thefts easier to uncover? In this course, we will explore answers to these questions as we examine several historic and contemporary examples of hoaxes, copies, and remixes. We'll ask questions about both the positive and negative aspects of such examples with the ultimate aim of discovering what they can show us about broader concepts such as individuality, uniqueness, and authenticity. Students will also have the opportunity to engage in independent research on a hoax, theft, or remix of their choosing."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion and workshop.
