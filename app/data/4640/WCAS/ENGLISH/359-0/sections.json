One of the first English writers to experiment with impressionist ideas and techniques, and a key contributor to naturalism, Hardy helped to fashion a distinctly \"modern\" narrative while advocating progressive social reform. We will study how his fiction challenged the limits of Victorian culture, voicing tensions that brought his novels to the brink of censorship. We will also pair those works with remarkable poems by him that make powerful claims about time, repetition, intimacy, doubt, and belief. In this way, we'll follow how his fiction tried to educate late-Victorian readers in new ways of perceiving and thinking about themselves, their environment, their shared history, and the world.", "qtr": "Fall 2016", "name": "Studies in Victorian Literature", "title": "WCAS ENGLISH 359-0-20 Studies in Victorian Literature", "lmod": "10/30/16 7:04 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-7475", "instructor_name": "Christopher   Lane", "instructor_addr": "University Hall Room 206"}], "topic": "Thomas Hardy: Distance & Desire", "course": "359-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course examines the major works of an exceptional nineteenth-century novelist and poet.
