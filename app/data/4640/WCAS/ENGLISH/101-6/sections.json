In this and other works of contemporary popular culture, the deep past is at once disturbingly alien and uniquely powerful, offering access to truths no longer available in the present day. In this course, we will investigate the middle ages and the modern world - and the relationship between them - through a series of case studies of dragons, grendels, werewolves, giants, hags, hybrids, and other monstrosities. What did these monsters mean in their own time, and what do they mean today? How do they threaten, and how do they help to produce, the civilized categories of family and nation? Is monstrosity ever positively valued - and if so, under what circumstances? We will proceed by pairing Buffy with the work of the medievalist critical theorist Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, the epic poem Beowulf with the 2007 film adaptation, the medieval romance Bisclavret with modern werewolf stories, and the alliterative poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight with The Sword of the Valiant (1984). We will also look at<br/>different versions of the mythical encounter between King Arthur and the Giant of St. Michael's<br/>Mount, and at the link between monstrosity and sexual sin in medieval church teachings and Chaucer's The Wife of Bath's Tale. In analyzing all of these works, we will draw on medieval and modern theories of monstrosity as articulated by St. Augustine, Isidore of Seville, John Mandeville, John Block Friedman, Lisa Verner, and others.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "23", "location": "University Hall 218", "topic": "Medieval Monsters", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ENGLISH/101-6/11943", "instructor": ["Katharine Helen Breen"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>", "id": "11943", "subject": "ENGLISH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "24", "location": "University Hall 018 English", "topic": "Am Wm Auteurs: Novels and Films, 1900-1945", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ENGLISH/101-6/11944", "instructor": ["Julia Ann   Stern"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>", "id": "11944", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
