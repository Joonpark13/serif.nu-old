In this course we will trace the trajectory of Bront\u00eb's most famous novel, Jane Eyre, from the time of its publication in 1847 to the present, when it is still an iconic text. We will begin with Austen's Northanger Abbey in in order to study Austin's send-up of the Gothic novel genre, before moving to the more serious appropriation of that genre in Jane Eyre (and maybe to irritate Bront\u00eb just a little on behalf of Austen!). We will then spend time studying Jane Eyre, the novel, its reception, and its literary fate in the 20th century. The ground-breaking critical text, Madwoman in the Attic by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar will be a focus, as well as subsequent critiques of Madwoman. We will also discuss literary appropriations, in particular Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys. Finally, we will look at Jane Eyre through the lens of popular culture, and draw some conclusions about Jane Eyre and its eponymous character Jane Eyre in the 21st century."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "TBA."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Northanger Abbey, Jane Austen; Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte; Wide Sargasso Sea, Jean Rhys; Madwoman in the Attic, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Guar.<br/><br/>Texts available at: Comix Revolution, 606 Davis Street, Evanston, but you may use any editions of the three novels or Madwoman."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "English 300 is an English Literature major and minor requirement.
