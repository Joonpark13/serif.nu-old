[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What spooks America? From the Puritan &quot;city upon a Hill,&quot; to Thomas Paine's Common Sense, to Emerson's American Adam, America was imagined as a New World paradise, a place to begin the world anew. And yet, from the story of Pocahontas and John Smith, to the origins of the American Gothic in the Age of Reason, to Melville's Moby Dick, American literature has been haunted by fantasies of terror, sin, violence, and apocalypse. Why? This course will seek to answer this question. Focusing on a selection of imaginative writings, including origin stories, poems, novels, and a slave narrative, we shall seek to identify and understand the significance of the terrors?of the savage, the dark other, the body, nature, sex, mixture, blood violence, totalitarian power, and apocalypse?that haunt and spook the origins and development of American literature. Students will be encouraged to draw connections between past American fantasies and fears and contemporary popular culture and politics, from classic American films like Hitchcock's Psycho to the television series Game of Thrones, from American blues and jazz to Michael Jackson's Thriller, from the Red Scare and the Cold War to the war on terror.", "name": "American Literary Traditions", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "270-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:00PM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ENGLISH/270-1/11959", "instructor": ["Betsy J Erkkila"], "id": "11959", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
