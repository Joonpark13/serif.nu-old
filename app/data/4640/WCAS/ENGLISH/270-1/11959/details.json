From the Puritan &quot;city upon a Hill,&quot; to Thomas Paine's Common Sense, to Emerson's American Adam, America was imagined as a New World paradise, a place to begin the world anew. And yet, from the story of Pocahontas and John Smith, to the origins of the American Gothic in the Age of Reason, to Melville's Moby Dick, American literature has been haunted by fantasies of terror, sin, violence, and apocalypse. Why? This course will seek to answer this question. Focusing on a selection of imaginative writings, including origin stories, poems, novels, and a slave narrative, we shall seek to identify and understand the significance of the terrors?of the savage, the dark other, the body, nature, sex, mixture, blood violence, totalitarian power, and apocalypse?that haunt and spook the origins and development of American literature. Students will be encouraged to draw connections between past American fantasies and fears and contemporary popular culture and politics, from classic American films like Hitchcock's Psycho to the television series Game of Thrones, from American blues and jazz to Michael Jackson's Thriller, from the Red Scare and the Cold War to the war on terror."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and discussion; weekly discussion sections."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "2 papers; quizzes; final examination."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "The Norton Anthology of American Literature: Beginnings to 1820 (Volume A; 8th edition); Charles Brockden Brown, Edgar Huntly or Memoirs of a Sleep-Walker; Ralph Waldo Emerson, Selected Writings; Edgar Allan Poe, Great Short Works; Frederick Douglass, The Narrative of Frederick Douglass; Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter; Herman Melville, Moby Dick."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "English 270-1 is an English Literature major and minor requirement; it is also designed for non-majors and counts as an Area VI WCAS distribution requirement."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:04 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
