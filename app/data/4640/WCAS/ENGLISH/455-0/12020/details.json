The objective is to better understand not only the arguments of classic texts but also the networks of people who brought the arguments forward and the various means by which Victorian culture gave rise to and fostered the ideas (in political, social, and aesthetic milieus), not as a fait accompli but a set of contested propositions. In addition to reading texts that express these principles, we will investigate modes and circumstances in which the values of Victorian liberalism circulated, for example parliamentary debates, sermons, trade fairs, lectures, meetings, and the press. The emphasis will be mid-century (Arnold, Lewes, Mill, Spencer, Gaskell, Kingsley, Martineau, Dilke) but we will also read outside these boundaries (Bright, Cobden, Shaw, and Wilde)."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "permission of department required"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "permission of department required"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:04 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
