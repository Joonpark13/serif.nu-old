[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "An introduction to some of the many possible voices, styles, and structures of the creative essay. Students will read from the full aesthetic breadth of the essay, including memoir, meditation, lyric essay, and literary journalism. Discussions will address how the essay creates an artistic space distinct from the worlds of poetry and fiction, and how truth and fact function within creative nonfiction. Students will be asked to analyze the readings closely, and to write six short essays based on imitations of the style, structure, syntax, and narrative devices found in the readings. Students can also expect to do some brief writing exercises and at least one revision.", "name": "Reading & Writing Creative Non-Fiction", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L05", "topic": "", "course": "208-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ENGLISH/208-0/12106", "instructor": ["Brian D Bouldrey"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "12106", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
