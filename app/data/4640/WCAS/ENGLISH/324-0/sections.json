In this course we will consider modern and contemporary cultural objects in relation to the medieval genres that inform them. We will read a selection of medieval texts designed to produce working definitions of the medieval genres of saint's life, romance, and morality play before exploring modern instantiations of those genres in a variety of media. Beyond finding often-surprising traces of the modern in the medieval and the medieval in the modern, we will consider ways in which characteristically medieval genres and tropes are brought to bear on modern problems.

What is the nature of moral and ethical transgression: is sin a disposition, a thought, an action, or an external force? And how does one make amends for such a transgression? Over the course of the quarter, we will attempt to answer these questions by exploring the shifting representations of sin, secrets and confession that pervade late medieval literature. Analyzing the texts of preachers and poets alike, we will investigate the ways in which medieval writers adapted their depictions of sin to address the major social and political issues of their day, highlighting certain sins while hiding others as the moment required. Along with sin, we will examine the practice of confession in its historical and literary contexts, discovering how priests, poets, and playwrights exploited and transformed this pastoral tool for narrative and social ends. While giving students a background in confessional practice and the discourse of Seven Deadly Sins, this course will also provide an introduction to some of the major works of the late Middle Ages: Dante's Purgatory, Langland's Piers Plowman, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and Everyman.
