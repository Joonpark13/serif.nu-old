[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will introduce students to a range of Shakespeare's comedies, tragedies, histories and romances. During the quarter, we will be considering these plays in their Early Modern context?cultural, political, literary and theatrical. We will focus centrally on matters of performance and of text. How is our interpretation of a play shaped by Shakespeare's various &quot;texts&quot;? his stories and their histories, the works of his contemporaries, the latest literary fashions, and the various versions of his plays that circulated among his audience? Similarly, how do the details of a given performance, or the presence of a particular audience, alter the experience of the play? To answer these questions, we will consider not only the theaters of Early Modern England, but also recent cinematic versions of the plays, and we will not only read only our modern edition of Shakespeare but also examine some pages from the plays as they originally circulated. Our readings may include Much Ado About Nothing, Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, Henry V, and the Tempest.", "name": "Introduction to Shakespeare", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "234-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ENGLISH/234-0/11950", "instructor": ["Susan E Phillips"], "id": "11950", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
