You will study and imitate some of the fruitful compressions and distortions liberated for your use by Jorge Luis Borges (Labyrinths), Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Chronicle of a Death Foretold), and W. G. Sebald (The Emigrants), as well as by the foremost member of the Oulipo group in France, Georges Perec (Things), by the English painter Tom Phillips (A Humument) , and by the Canadian classical scholar, poet, and painter Anne Carson (Nox). The course begins with the making of an origami box crosshatched with phrases chosen from your recent writing and enclosing one or two locally and recently &quot;found objects&quot;; and it ends with the making of a physical book with a three-dimensional, pull-out, or painted feature. Your book will also respond to and re-imagine another work of art, as Christoph Ransmayr does to Ovid's Metamorphoses in The Last World. Weekly exercises, imitations, and abbreviated &quot;takes&quot; may join into this 20-page final project. May count as the non-core course in the creative writing Cross-Genre Minor.
