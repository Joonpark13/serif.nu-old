This class will journey to Chicago's financial district, political and commercial core, cultural institutions, hotels, theaters, parks, schools, cemeteries, and ethnic neighborhoods. By walking the city, you will learn to &quot;read&quot; the streets, buildings, and monuments that showcase Chicago's engagement with the classical past. You will also learn how to use digital tools and practices ? such as video editing, data analysis, and digital mapping ? to produce an innovative and collaborative virtual walking tour mapping Chicago's ongoing dialogue with Roman antiquity.", "name": "Humanities in the Digital Age", "section": "20", "topic": "Ancient Rome in Chicago", "course": "325-6", "meeting_time": ["Mo 3:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HUM/325-6/12934", "instructor": ["Francesca   Tataranni"], "id": "12934", "subject": "HUM"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What is the history of cultural and arts criticism in the United States? Where is it headed today? This methods course combines historical examination with fieldwork in the setting of a contemporary art museum. Students read extensively in the history of cultural criticism while experimenting with new, digital modes of writing. The course convenes in seminar format once a week on the Evanston campus (Thursdays) and once a week at the Museum of Contemporary Art, conveniently located across the street from the Chicago campus's stop for the free Intercampus bus (Tuesdays, when the museum is open late and free to the public; other trips to the MCA will be required to complete assignments as well). Over the course of the quarter, we will meet with MCA staff and Northwestern faculty whose work examines cultural criticism.
