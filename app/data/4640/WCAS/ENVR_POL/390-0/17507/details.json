Cultural resources include architecture, archeological sites, language, cultural landscapes, ethno-ecosystems, cultural traditions and practices, sacred sites, oral history and community voice. The class will cover; 1) the history of cultural resource management theory in the United States and how that has, and still, affects policy making and enforcement; 2) the relationships between Federal, State, and American Indian Tribal governments regarding the enactment of cultural resource policies; 4) various laws and acts including the National Historic Preservation Act, Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Antiquities Act, and Archaeological Resource Protection Act; and 5) ethical issues that arise from multiple perspectives of culturally significant landscapes, places, beliefs and practices. Selected case studies will be utilized as both a focus for, and to facilitate, class discussions. Readings will include books and selected articles relevant to the course.<br/><br/>Dr. Eli Suzukovich III is an anthropologist and lecturer in the Environmental Policy and Culture program and the Science in Human Culture program (Anthropology)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "? 2012.
