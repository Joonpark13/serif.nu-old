What processes led to this extreme diversification? How can an understanding of primate diversity inform studies of human physiology and behavior? In this course we will use both classic and recent non-human primate studies to explore topics such as nutrition, growth, disease, sociality, cognition, and communication. We will also address the issue of primate-human conflict and conservation. At the end of this course, you will understand ecological and evolutionary theories relevant for explaining variation across the primate phylogeny and appreciate how studies of non-human primates impact our perspectives on human physiology and behavior."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Course readings will be provided electronically."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:58 PM (CT)", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
