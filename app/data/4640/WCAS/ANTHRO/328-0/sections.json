We will look<br/><br/>at the archaeology - from temples and cities to farmers&#39; homes and fields - to explore<br/><br/>ancient Maya daily lives. We will explore the Maya hieroglyphic writing system<br/><br/>which gives us insight into Maya beliefs, religion, and worldview. Major topics will<br/><br/>include the rise of ancient Maya civilization and the ancient Maya social, economic,<br/><br/>and political systems, subsistence, and religion. The course concludes with an in-<br/><br/>depth study of daily life in the ancient Maya world.
