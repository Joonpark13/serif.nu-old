This course will survey some of these &quot;paleo&quot; recommendations and popular conceptions of our ancestors. These popular conceptions will be viewed critically against the evidence for what our ancestors actually did and what, if anything, it means for people living in the modern era. Some of the included topics will include dietary recommendations, exercise/barefoot running, childcare and feeding practices, and pathogen exposure/immune function."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "METHOD OF EVALUATION <br/>Class participation = 100 points (30% of final grade)<br/>Reaction papers = 10 points each (40% of final grade)<br/>Final = 100 points (30% of final grade)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "READING LIST <br/>A course packet will be put together and distributed through Quartet Copy."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:58 PM (CT)", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
