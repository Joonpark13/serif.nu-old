After constructing a solid foundation in life history theory and the comparative method, the class will address questions such as: Why do humans grow and develop much more slowly than other primate species? Why do we have so few offspring? What is the significance of puberty? What is the function of menopause? In-depth analysis of several case studies will allow the class to examine in detail the utility of life history theory for explaining aspects of human development and behavior from an evolutionary perspective."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Course pack can be picked up at Quartet Copy, 825 Clark St, Evanston."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:58 PM (CT)", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
