[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In barely a decade, social media has transformed the world around us, the way we learn, the way we communicate, and our relationships. The changes have inspired claims about the ways social media are changing our lives. Yet most of these claims are very general. Taking an anthropological view, this course looks at a variety of forms of social media in very different social contexts, concentrating on content of social media rather than platforms. We will also use social media as a research method for understanding people's lives as they converge in both online and offline spaces. We will see not only how social media has changed people's lives but also how these people have changed social media. Interestingly, this course challenges many of the claims that are made about what social media is by showing the incredible variation in social media that emerges on different continents, among people of different class and religious backgrounds, for people with different gender identities and sexual preferences, for producers, consumers, and students. As we will find, social media can tell us much about the contemporary world at large.", "name": "Anthropology of Social Media", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "270-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ANTHRO/270-0/18874", "instructor": ["Emily N Haynes"], "id": "18874", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
