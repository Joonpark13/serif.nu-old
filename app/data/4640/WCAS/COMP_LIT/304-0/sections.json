[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Numerous critics have identified the detective story as the genre in which modernity and its visual regimes are both exposed and de-familiarized. This course will explore the radically innovative ways in which Italian cinema has &quot;undone&quot; the detective genre, questioning received notions of history, memory, and truth. We will begin with Luchino Visconti's Ossessione, the first Neorealist film and also the free adaptation of James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice, continue with Michelangelo Antonioni's &quot;impossible&quot; detective stories (L'avventura, Blow-up, and The Passenger), and then focus on those works by Bernardo Bertolucci, Liliana Cavani, and Elio Petri that most forcefully responded to the watershed events of 1968. During the course, we will analyze each film in close detail and also read literary texts by Italo Calvino, Jorge Luis Borges, and Leonardo Sciascia.", "name": "Studies in Theme", "section": "20", "topic": "The Detective and the Witness", "course": "304-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/COMP_LIT/304-0/14241", "instructor": ["Domietta   Torlasco"], "id": "14241", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Course Description: Women and violence is growing topic of interest in our media culture, with entire channels like ID Discovery devoted to marketing true-crime dramas to a mostly female viewership.
