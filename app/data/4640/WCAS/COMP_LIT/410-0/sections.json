[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Theories of Tragedy<br/><br/>The aim of this theory is to understand certain formative moments in the development of the theory of tragedy under five major groupings: 1) Aristotle's theory of tragedy in response to Plato's dismissal of the tragedian from the polis under construction in The Republic; 2) the emergence of a new, non-Aristotelian theory of tragedy in the context of post-Kantian German idealism, with particular emphasis on Schelling's Letters on Criticism and Dogmatism, Hegel's exposition of Antigone in The Phenomenology of Spirit, and H\u00f6lderlin's &quot;Remarks on Oedipus&quot; and especially his &quot;Remarks on Antigone&quot;; 3) Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy in response to Wagner's and Schopenhauer's provocations; and 4) Benjamin's early reflections on tragedy, which, in response to Luk\u00e1cs and Rosenzweig as well as his own further inquiries into &quot;the guilt-complex of the living,&quot; culminate in his Origin of the German Mourning Play. In addition to the theories of tragedy noted above, students will be expected to have read Antigone, Oedipus Rex, and Oedipus at Colonus. Each student will develop an in-class presentation around a tragedy of his or her own choosing, which everyone in the seminar will be encouraged to read and discuss. The final seminar paper will be a development of the in-class presentation.", "name": "Theories of Literature", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "410-0", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/COMP_LIT/410-0/14237", "instructor": ["Peter D Fenves"], "id": "14237", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
