[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar is designed as a forum for the independent development and completion of a substantive scholarly paper in the field of Comparative Literature. The paper must involve either the study of literary texts from different literary traditions or the study of literature in relation to other media, other arts, or other disciplines. To this end, a number of short written assignments will be required, including an abstract, an annotated bibliography (using bibliographical software), and a formal project outline. The bulk of the coursework will comprise the senior paper itself (12-15 pages) and an oral presentation of the project to the class. The latter assignment will serve as a dress-rehearsal for the Senior CLS Colloquium, which will be held at the end of the quarter. The colloquium allows (and requires) all students to present their projects to the entire CLS community, including faculty and graduate students who will be in attendance.", "name": "Senior Seminar", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "398-0", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/COMP_LIT/398-0/14229", "instructor": ["Tristram Nash Wolff"], "id": "14229", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
