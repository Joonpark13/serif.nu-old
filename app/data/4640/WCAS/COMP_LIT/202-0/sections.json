[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course takes its point of departure from two sayings: &quot;there are no facts, only interpretations&quot; (Nietzsche), and &quot;Only here is suffering suffering&quot; (Kafka). It explores the relationship between suffering and interpretation. For Nietzsche, the interpretation of suffering - real or imagined - is not only the origin of all moral and legal categories but also the source of philosophical speculation. For many of the characters that inhabit Kafka's fictions, suffering - real or imagined - generates interminable interpretations, and the interminability of interpretation is itself the source of intensified suffering. In the first part of the course the students will read short sections from Nietzsche's &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; and the entirety of his &quot;Genealogy of Morals.&quot; In the second, students will be exposed to a series of Kafka stories, a collection of his aphorisms, and his great unfinished novel, &quot;The Castle.&quot;", "name": "Interpreting Culture", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "202-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/COMP_LIT/202-0/14224", "instructor": ["Peter D Fenves"], "id": "14224", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course explores the history, music, and narrative conventions of popular Hindi cinema in India, commonly referred to as &quot;Bollywood.&quot; Bollywood movies, readily identified by their song-and-dance sequences and &quot;masala&quot;-style mixing of filmic genres, are among the most avidly watched films in the world. Focusing on films that engage major historical and cultural moments in more than sixty years of modern Indian nationhood, we will explore why Bollywood-style storytelling is so effective as well as examine how these filmic narratives both reflect and shape the culture and society in which they are created.", "name": "Interpreting Culture", "section": "21", "topic": "Beyond Bollywood", "course": "202-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/COMP_LIT/202-0/14225", "instructor": ["Laura Rebecca Brueck"], "id": "14225", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
