This freshman seminar explores heroes and the tests they face, the journeys they pursue, and the ways in which adversity and accident shape them. What is a hero? When is a hero born, and when is s/he made? What are the lessons of failure and self-delusion that the quest and the trial teach? Beginning with the Song of Roland, we will examine epic, Arthurian romance and comic parodies of knightly genres in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and then turn to contemporary film to trace the ways in which modern fantasy and superhero adventures raise old questions and provide new answers to the dilemmas and ordeals of the hero's self-defining mission. Works under discussion will include Chretien de Troyes' Lancelot, or the Knight of the Cart, Marguerite de Navarre's Heptameron, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais' Pantagruel and Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote, as well as Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride and Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises.", "qtr": "Fall 2016", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "title": "WCAS FRENCH 105-6-20 First-Year Seminar", "lmod": "10/30/16 7:04 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-8270", "instructor_name": "Cynthia Nyree Nazarian", "instructor_addr": "1860 S.
