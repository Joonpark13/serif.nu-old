[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course, taught in English, will serve as an introduction to existentialism, which not only defined the literary, philosophical and political culture for French intellectuals of the post-war period, but also remain indispensable for an understanding of various currents of contemporary literature and culture. We shall begin by discussing the philosophical and literary foundations of existentialism. Then we will examine the moral, social and political questions central to existentialism, as worked out in the fiction, drama, and essays of such authors as Sartre, Beauvoir, Beckett, and Fanon. Finally, we will consider the extent to which post-existentialist thought and culture may be read as a continuation of or as a reaction against existentialism.", "name": "The Literature of Existentialism", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "277-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/FRENCH/277-0/12147", "instructor": ["Scott P Durham"], "id": "12147", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
