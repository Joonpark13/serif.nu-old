This seminar explores his writings in depth, along with those of his most important interlocutors, in the context of the emergence of modern subjectivity in the period we call &quot;Renaissance&quot;. We will consider a set of problems relative to the constitution of the self, especially in terms of historical, rhetorical, and epistemological paradigms. We will use Montaigne's writings as a gateway into a turbulent and transformative period of history, in which Old World confronted New World, and long-held religious and moral beliefs gave way to violent doubt and critical reconfiguration.<br/><br/>All classes, papers and readings will be in French. We will be engaging in detailed close readings and critical analyses both in writing and in class."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "FRE 271, 272 or 273"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminars.
