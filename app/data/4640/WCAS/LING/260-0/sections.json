[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this class we will explore the formal structure of words (morphology) and sentences (syntax) in natural language. We will analyze data from a variety of languages (including English), focusing on the differences among morphological and syntactic systems, but also on the generalizations that can be made about all languages. You will learn terminology and facts about syntax and morphology, but more<br/>importantly, you will learn the basic concepts, skills, and methodology necessary for scientific theory construction and analytical reasoning more generally. The focus of this class is on formal (structural) aspects of language rather than on its social aspects. For this reason, it satisfies the WCAS Area II (Formal Studies) Distribution Requirement.", "name": "Formal Analysis of Words &amp; Sentences", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "260-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/LING/260-0/13188", "instructor": ["Masaya   Yoshida"], "id": "13188", "subject": "LING"}]
