These two categories of research have different scope, limits, and methods. This course develops an understanding of the state of contemporary experimental research on meaning through readings, lecture, and discussion. Specific topics to be covered might include the mass/count distinction, plurality, event semantics, quantifiers, numerals, vagueness, gradability, and presupposition.", "name": "Topics in Linguistics", "section": "21", "topic": "Experimental Semantics", "course": "300-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/LING/300-0/17593", "instructor": ["Alexis Cornelia Wellwood"], "id": "17593", "subject": "LING"}]
