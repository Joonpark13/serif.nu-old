[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an introduction to the basic concepts and methods of semantics and pragmatics. We will explore different aspects of meaning (word meaning, sentence meaning, truth conditions) and inference types (entailment, presupposition, implicature), become familiar with the analytical tools used to investigate these phenomena, and discuss major theoretical approaches to the study of linguistic meaning. This course is a prerequisite for higher-level courses in semantics and pragmatics, and is recommended to students specializing in other areas of linguistics as a comprehensive overview of linguistic meaning.", "name": "Fundamentals of Meaning", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "370-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/LING/370-0/13189", "instructor": ["Alexis Cornelia Wellwood"], "id": "13189", "subject": "LING"}]
