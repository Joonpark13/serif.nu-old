[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course will offer a survey of European History from 1050-1750. We will concentrate on the big events of the period - the Great Schism, the Black Death, the Reformation, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment - but we will also try to recognize the longer historical trends, such as the evolution of the nation-state and the power and violence of imperialism. Comprehending the immense change that took place during this period will prove invaluable for students seeking to understand the world today. For this reason, we will maintain a strong focus on critical thinking and interpretation of primary sources.", "name": "European Civilization I", "section": "15", "topic": "", "course": "201-A", "meeting_time": ["We 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SCS/HISTORY/201-A/18441", "instructor": ["Shannon Grady Blaha"], "id": "18441", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
