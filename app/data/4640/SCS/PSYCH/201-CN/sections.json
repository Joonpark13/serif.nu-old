[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course explores techniques for describing the real world with numbers and for making educated guesses about how the world works by manipulating these numbers. Students acquire a knowledge of how to execute statistical tests, but more importantly when and why to execute these tests. Emphasis is placed on understanding and interpreting data as well as on techniques of statistical analysis. A secondary goal of this course is to provide a framework from which to think critically about statistical evidence presented in the media and research reports from journals in psychology. Classes will consist of lecture and problem-based group work. The assessments include in-class quizzes, exams, a series of in-class &quot;team&quot; problem sets, take home problem sets, and a short paper analyzing the use of statistical information in the media. May not be audited.
