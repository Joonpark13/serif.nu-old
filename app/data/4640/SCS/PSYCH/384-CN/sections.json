[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Having meaningful, rewarding relationships is one of the biggest determinants of whether we are happy and healthy: good relationships don't only influence our emotional wellbeing, but also our physical vitality and even how long we live. In this course, we will explore why relationships and belonging are so profoundly important to humans. We will then turn our focus to how relationships begin, and how we decide who exactly we want to be closer with. We will discuss how we can best maintain fulfilling, healthy relationships once we've found them, and how relationships can shape, change, and motivate us. Finally, we'll explore the consequences of rejection and of losing a valued relationship. <br/><br/>This course will give you research-based tools to understand and navigate relationships in your own life. To accomplish this, we will analyze primary research within class discussions and writing assignments. We will focus on integrating ideas from the wide range of scientific perspectives on relationships, and on thoughtfully applying findings from relationship psychology to real-world situations.", "name": "Close Relationships", "section": "15", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 714", "topic": "", "course": "384-CN", "meeting_time": ["We 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SCS/PSYCH/384-CN/18467", "instructor": ["Grace   Larson"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "18467", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
