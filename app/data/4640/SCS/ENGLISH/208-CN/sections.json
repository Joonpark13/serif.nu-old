Craft topics will include devising a premise, finding a subject, constructing scenes, creating characters, conducting interviews, doing research, writing reviews, and blogging (in an interesting way). Ultimately, this course will help you strengthen your craft, sharpen your writing habits (or develop new ones), and become a better reader of your work and the work of others. You'll leave with a portfolio of original writing, a new perspective on what it means to write creative nonfiction, and a stronger connection to the literary community.
