Readings will include writings by Seneca, Montaigne, Virginia Woolf, Annie Dillard, Joan Didion, David Foster Wallace, et al. Modes of creative nonfiction covered will be memoir/the personal essay, the narrative essay, the lyric essay, the opinion essay/op-ed, the interview/Q&amp;A (a la Jimmy Fallon, Billy on the Street, John Oliver, and the Paris Review), reviewing, and food writing. Craft topics will include devising a premise, finding a subject, constructing scenes, creating characters, conducting interviews, doing research, writing reviews, and blogging (in an interesting way). Ultimately, this course will help you strengthen your craft, sharpen your writing habits (or develop new ones), and become a better reader of your work and the work of others. You'll leave with a portfolio of original writing, a new perspective on what it means to write creative nonfiction, and a stronger connection to the literary community. The focus will be on short forms."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Course requirements include attendance and participation in all in-class writing exercises, two reading responses, leading two critiques, one street interview, and one longer piece that has been revised, edited and proofread.
