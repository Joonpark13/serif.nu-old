[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course will address the question of politics from below rather from above. We will focus on the relationship between both the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement's relationship to the Democratic and Republican parties, and how the 2016 presidential election bears some similarities to and differences from the election year 1968. That each party has a popular candidate who represents anti-politics becomes an interesting theme for political analysis in 2016 and beyond.<br/><br/>This course is also listed as POLI SCI 395 Political Research Seminar in CAESAR. Students who need to fulfill the research seminar requirement for the political science major may register for POLI SCI 395.", "name": "Special Topics", "section": "64", "location": "University Hall 121", "topic": "Sixties in American Politics", "course": "390-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SCS/POLI_SCI/390-CN/18481", "instructor": ["Jeffrey   Rice"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "18481", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
