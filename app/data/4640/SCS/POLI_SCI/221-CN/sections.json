[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Cities appear to have decreasing control over their own affairs and seem to be at the mercy of economic change, in competition for citizens, industries, and resources. Sociocultural, ethnoracial, and demographic diversity also create a unique set of challenges. In recent decades, cities have relied on aggressive policy initiatives ranging from slum clearance to school reform to corporate welfare to stadium construction to attract and retain desired businesses and residents. This \"limited city\" as described here appears to play second fiddle in American politics while all the important decisions are made at the state and federal level. Somehow, though, cities manage to provide for densely settled populations even as they cope with their often deserved reputations for vice, dangerous streets, and public disorder. Cities have the biggest day-to-day influence on routine life, operating at the level of basic needs: making sure water runs, sewers flow, streets are clear, and people are safe from crime and life-threatening injury. This course will investigate how that power is used (and misused)-more specifically, how cities control their streets (and their citizens), maintain public order, shape buildings and infrastructure, and make themselves attractive to the residents that drive local economies.", "name": "Urban Politics", "section": "65", "location": "Parkes Hall 215", "topic": "", "course": "221-CN", "meeting_time": ["We 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SCS/POLI_SCI/221-CN/18462", "instructor": ["Brian Falb Harrison"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "18462", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
