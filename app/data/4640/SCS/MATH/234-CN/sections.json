[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course will be concerned with multivariable integrals, which are the generalizations of the type of integral you saw in a single-variable calculus course to higher-dimensional settings. Specific topics include: double and triple integrals, change of variables, line and surface integrals, vector fields, and the fundamental theorems of Green, Stokes, and Gauss. We will focus on both setting-up and computing such integrals, and on understanding the types of situations in which they arise.", "name": "Multiple Integration and Vector Calculus", "section": "62", "topic": "", "course": "234-CN", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SCS/MATH/234-CN/18475", "instructor": ["Santiago   Canez"], "id": "18475", "subject": "MATH"}]
