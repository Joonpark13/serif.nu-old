The story of modern cosmology is the story of science itself. From the positions and movement of planets to the shining of the stars and the glow of the earliest light in the universe, our search for our place in the cosmos developed scientific methods that drove us to new heights of discovery. See the world through different eyes and learn about the mysteries revealed by X-rays, radio waves and the recently discovered gravitational waves from colliding black holes. Explore the lives and deaths of stars as we uncover the most astounding facts about the universe. Take a tour of the dark side as we explore dark matter, dark energy, and black holes. Travel virtually back in time 99.997% of the way to the Big Bang itself to see a \"baby picture\" of the universe. From its origin to its ultimate destiny, we will explore the scientific story of our universe - what we know and how we know it.
