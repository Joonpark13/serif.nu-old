The course is the first of two courses in object-oriented programing for the Information Systems major. The course begins with a quick introduction to the basics of the Java language: variables, conditionals, looping and user-defined methods. Students write programs that utilize methods, arrays and array lists and exception handling for solving problems. Information hiding, inheritance, polymorphism, aggregation and interfaces as principles of object-oriented programming will be introduced. This course includes interactive lectures and labs.
