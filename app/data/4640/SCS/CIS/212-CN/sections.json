[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course focuses on developing complex programs using the Java object-oriented language. The course is the first of two courses in object-oriented programing for the Information Systems major. The course begins with a quick introduction to the basics of the Java language: variables, conditionals, looping and user-defined methods. Students write programs that utilize methods, arrays and array lists and exception handling for solving problems. Information hiding, inheritance, polymorphism, aggregation and interfaces as principles of object-oriented programming will be introduced. This course includes interactive lectures and labs. Students will be required to complete multiple computer programs and quizzes. A final assignment is required for students to illustrate their understanding of all programming topics covered in the course.", "name": "Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming", "section": "16", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 517", "topic": "", "course": "212-CN", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SCS/CIS/212-CN/18444", "instructor": ["Jacqueline Ann Bird"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "18444", "subject": "CIS"}]
