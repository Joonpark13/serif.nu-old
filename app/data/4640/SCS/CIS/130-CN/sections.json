Students will explore the basic design principles of page layout and navigation. Students will also learn how to develop Web pages using the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML5), describe page presentation using the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) language, and develop facility with useful Web development applications such as Adobe Dreamweaver.<br/><br/>The primary focus of this course will be on client-side technologies. At the end of the course, students will be familiar with the basic Web page components and structures. Special emphasis will be on understanding the Document Object Model (DOM) used in Web documents and used by the JavaScript language for creating interactive Web pages. Through the use of JavaScript, students will be introduced to programming concepts, event-driven programming, and entry-level object-orientation. Various other Web technologies such as DHTML, XML, XSLT, and Ajax will be also discussed.", "qtr": "Fall 2016", "name": "Tools and Technologies of the World Wide Web", "title": "SCS CIS 130-CN-12 Tools and Technologies of the World Wide Web", "lmod": "10/30/16 6:54 PM (CT)", "section": "12", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Jacqueline Ann Bird", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "130-CN", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course introduces students to the current tools and technologies used for designing and developing interactive Web sites.
