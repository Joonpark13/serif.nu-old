[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "The course is an exploration of the blogosphere with an eye toward understanding what makes a good blog and replicating those elements. Students will evaluate the work of the most successful (i.e. highly trafficked) blog sites and learn to create engaging blogs themselves. The objective is not only to gain a deeper understanding of blog culture and creation, but to help each student become branded bloggers in their own right. The course also touches on issues such as Search Engine Optimization (the key to driving traffic), libel and copyright law, as well as the basics of vivid writing. As is the case with most of the offerings in Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism, students will learn by doing. Sessions will be organized around subject areas to allow students the opportunity to try different blog formats (travel blogs, pop/culture/entertainment blogs, personal blogs, political blogs), with the goal of helping students find their voices as writers and social critics. Blog techniques, multi-media and incorporation of other news feeds will be explored, and guest speakers will talk about their approaches to generating ideas and traffic. Students needn't have previous journalism or HTML coding experience to take this course, though some basic knowledge about gathering information would be helpful.", "name": "Topics in Journalism", "section": "15", "topic": "Deconstructing the Blog", "course": "390-CN", "meeting_time": ["We 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SCS/JRN_WRIT/390-CN/18449", "instructor": ["Charles F Whitaker"], "id": "18449", "subject": "JRN_WRIT"}]
