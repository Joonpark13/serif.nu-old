For that reason, an understanding of our financial system is critical to managing and planning for any business - even those in unrelated industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, publishing and entertainment. This course provides an understanding of how and why &quot;money&quot; developed: as a way to facilitate barter, store value (excess production) and as a unit of account. After initial discussions of the types and history of money, the course explores financial institutions, different kinds of financial instruments, and the role of our central bank, the Federal Reserve. Questions the course answers include: How can policy and institutions create or moderate business cycles? How does monetary policy effect inflation and economic growth? How does international trade and foreign currency exchange impact these things? What tools do we have to predict how policy decisions will effect inflation and economic growth, and how do we use them?"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "ECON 201, 202"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "ECON"}]
