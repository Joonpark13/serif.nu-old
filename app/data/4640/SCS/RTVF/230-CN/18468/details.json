Mass media have been important to society since before the Industrial Revolution. The media have been sites of contestation, controversy, and critique, and they are essential to questions of ideology and cultural power. We will look at elite efforts to demonize and police popular culture; populist arguments on the artistry and political utility of popular forms; and significant artistic, cultural, and economic movements that frame or employ the production and reception of popular media. Throughout the course we will also interrogate the media's role in larger struggles over the politics of class, taste, race, sexuality, and gender.
