[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course utilizes an evolutionary perspective to understand key features of human anatomy, health and disease. Coverage will include review of some basic evolutionary processes, a brief overview of human evolutionary history, followed by a consideration of the primary body systems and regions in the human organism. Our focus will be on the historical context of selected human structures and their function/dysfunction across these systems. Some specific topics covered include: evolutionary compromises and plasticity in musculoskeletal structures; complex structures and birth defects (pharyngeal arches, etc.); human developmental genetics, environmental plasticity, and epigenetics in relation to health and disease; theories of &quot;mismatch&quot; between modern lifestyles and our evolved features (related to metabolism; allergy, the microbiome, cancer, etc.); population growth and zoonoses; and human life history and aging in evolutionary perspective. This course is suitable for students interested in human evolutionary biology and health, and those planning careers in the health sciences.", "name": "The Evolutionary Biology of Human Anatomy, Heath and Disease", "section": "16", "topic": "", "course": "312-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SCS/BIOL_SCI/312-CN/18477", "instructor": ["Brian T Shea"], "id": "18477", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
