We will examine the role of the immune system in both health and disease. The field of<br/>immunobiology integrates recent developments and techniques in molecular biology, cell biology, and<br/>physiology. The emphasis of this course will be on the human immune system and how its successes,<br/>failures and compromises affect our lives. Students will understand how disorders such as HIV/AIDS,<br/>cancer, and autoimmune diseases develop in the context of a failed or over-active immune system."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: BIOL SCI 210-C or BIOL SCI 217."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Understand the molecular and cellular basis of the immune response.<br/>Probe the underlying mechanisms of immune system dysfunction as it relates to disease.<br/>Synthesize information based on fundamental knowledge and experimental evidence."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture<br/>In-class group work<br/>Class participation<br/>Discussion<br/>Readings"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Midterm and final exam, quizzes, homework assignments, pre-reading."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "The Immune System (4th ed.) by Peter Parham<br/>ISBN: 978-0-8153-4466-7"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
