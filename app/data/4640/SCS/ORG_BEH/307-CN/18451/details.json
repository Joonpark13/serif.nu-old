Such leadership should be grounded in the knowledge of foundational theories of leadership, including transformational, behavioral, situational, and contingency models, and the study of individual leaders and organizational contexts of leadership. The goal of the course is to help students define their own vision of leadership, to experience &quot;leadership moments,&quot; identify personal aspects of leadership, and recognize that to be an effective leader in the workplace one must know how to motivate and empower people, foster relationships, and influence outcomes. Case studies and structured simulations are used to provide opportunities to &quot;try on&quot; various leadership roles and take strategic action. This course combines classroom lecture and discussion with an online component. For the lecture and discussion components, this course is paired with an afternoon session of BLP/ENGLISH 205-CN taught by Leslie Fischer, and the in-class meetings are on alternate Saturdays: 9/24, 10/8, 10/22, 11/5, 11/19.
