[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Human Resources is one of the least understood -and least maximized- functions within organizations. Leaders often are unsure what to &quot;do&quot; with HR (and often, Human Resources adds to this confusion) and may limit it to traditional responsibilities: hiring, compensation, benefits, training, etc. But leaders of any merit recognize that limiting HR to these transactional roles adds very little to the strategic direction of their organization. Leaders within organizations have seen the value of what a highly expert HR function can offer and expects it not only from their HR professionals, but all leaders within their organizations. Ultimately, the challenge for HR is to help all leaders within an organization accept that they are each a &quot;Human Resources Leader.&quot; This course will explore how HR has evolved from its inception to the present day HR function - and the direction organizations need it to continue to move toward. The majority of the course will focus on ensuring students learn that to be an effective leader within any organization, they must consider themselves as Human Resources Leaders. To accomplish this, students will learn the key responsibilities and competencies that many organizations are now expecting of Human Resources - and leaders of people overall. The field of Human Resources is changing dramatically, and this course seeks to explore this, and shed light on how these changes affect all within an organization.<br/><br/><br/>This course combines classroom lecture and discussion with an online component. The course will meet in-person on 9/26, 10/10, 10/24, 11/7, 11/21, and 12/5.
