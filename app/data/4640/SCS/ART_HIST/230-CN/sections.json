We will examine painting, architecture, sculpture, prints, decorative arts, and photography in order to understand the richness of the visual arts in America. We will begin by looking at Native American objects, and how Euro-Americans imagined the New World in the colonial period. Then we will investigate American art as it relates to revolution, national identity, patronage, and the economy in the early Republic, and in a growing nineteenth-century global culture. The course concludes with a study of the radical, modern American art movements of the twentieth century. By highlighting the multiple intersections of art and culture, students will perceive the complexity and diversity of American art and its histories. Students will have the opportunity to view original objects when we visit the superb American Collections at the Art Institute of Chicago. Requirements include a paper on one original artwork of students' choosing, responses to primary visual and textual sources in lively class discussions.", "qtr": "Fall 2016", "name": "Introduction to American Art", "title": "SCS ART_HIST 230-CN-16 Introduction to American Art", "lmod": "10/30/16 6:53 PM (CT)", "section": "16", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Roberta G Katz", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "230-CN", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course introduces students to American art from the colonial through the modern period.
