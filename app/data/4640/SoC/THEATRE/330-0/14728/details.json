Students will experience making choices, decisions and presentations about the processes involved in producing a play or musical. This course will have resonance for any student who has ever produced his/her own show as well as for students who are beginning to think about producing and/or starting their own theatres upon graduating from Northwestern.<br/><br/>The course also offers an overview of artistic leadership and exposes students to artistic leaders working at theatres locally and throughout the country. Students will meet more than a half dozen Chicago theatre arts leaders and hear from these leaders about their artistic impulses and processes, creative ambitions and goals, successes, as well as their dreams for the future. Students will research an arts leader, including his/her artistic leadership styles and strategies, and the impact of these styles on artists' own lives as well as on the work they create and the companies they run. The class also includes a survey of leadership and management theory and its applicability in theatre."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:51 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
