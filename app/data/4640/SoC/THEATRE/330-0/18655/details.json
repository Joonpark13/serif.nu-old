The focus will be on how to create these physically demanding scenes while maintaining a high level of safety for the actors involved. Throughout the semester we will study various unarmed techniques and their adaptations for stage resulting in a complete fight between characters, experiment with developing original choreography, analyze examples of such choreography in media, and lay a foundation of understanding of actor's rights when such scenes appear in the rehearsal process. This class is ultimately an acting class and will be challenging students to push the boundaries of their work in order to present a scene that is believable under these extreme given circumstances."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:51 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
