[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Creativity and Innovation in Context<br/><br/>This course explores an intriguing problem in social scientific analysis: the production of new ideas and practices as well as the reputations of their creators: How do social and cultural contexts affect creative output and innovations? How do professional communities determine when ideas are original, instead of misguided or infeasible? How does this compare across the media/arts, the sciences, or the economy? Students will be acquainted with key approaches to creativity and innovation in sociology, but also psychology and organizational analysis. Furthermore, through a set of assignments, they will learn important skills for their own future creative academic or professional work. The course will involve brief lectures, discussions, and a field trip.", "name": "Communication Studies Research Seminar", "section": "20", "topic": "Creativity and Innovation", "course": "394-0", "meeting_time": ["We 3:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SoC/COMM_ST/394-0/17573", "instructor": ["Larissa   Buchholz"], "id": "17573", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
