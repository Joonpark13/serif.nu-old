This sequence is exclusively for School of Communication seniors who have been admitted to the Creative Writing for the Media Module. <br/><br/>During this quarter, students will focus on developing the intuitive and unconscious elements of the creative process with the goal of optimally synthesizing those elements with the more rational and conscious aspects of that process. They will then apply their mastery of the art and craft of narrative form toward significant progress on the full-length project section of their module requirements. <br/><br/>EVALUATION METHOD: Classes will be structured around lectures, discussions, reading assignments, viewing of selected films and clips, and workshop of student projects. Above all else, the classroom environment will be a supportive one and students will be encouraged to participate in a community marked by an atmosphere of collaboration. <br/><br/>Writing assignments are arranged to give fullest latitude to accommodate a variety of approaches to a writer's creative process starting with ideas and culminating in the successful and significant progress on the full-length project. <br/><br/>Evaluation will be based on final script material, class participation/professionalism and performance on Canvas Posts/Discussion Boards and writing assignments. <br/><br/>CLASS MATERIALS: <br/><br/>Required Textbooks: <br/>?
