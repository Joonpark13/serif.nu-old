The course will focus on understanding the relationship between screens, the spaces around screens, and human performance. The course is a practical survey of systems that create meaning by engendering human interaction and participation. Students are encouraged to use a range of creative media to initiate playful situations that span different disciplines and dimensions of art-making. Units are constructed around questions of what contexts are suitable for the combination of live performance and media, how one might approach different audiences, and how one constructs a system that negotiates order with unexpected results.
