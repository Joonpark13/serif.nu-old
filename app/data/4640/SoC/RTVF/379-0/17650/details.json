Thurs 10-12:50, Louis 118<br/>Professor Laura Kipnis<br/><br/>What's so funny about two people trying to have (or trying and failing to have) a relationship? We'll be doing weekly screenings (outside of class) of both classics of the genre and more modern examples. Students will read popular romantic advice books from which you'll also derive potential comedic premises; we'll discuss both the genre and romantic love generally, and then you'll put everything you've learned about love and its mishaps into a final project.<br/><br/>The final project is a short video (7-10 min) from original or adapted material in which you explore romantic comedy. You can work independently or in pairs. <br/><br/>Note: all students will be shooting their final projects in this class.<br/><br/>No late adds and you must be at the first class to hold your spot!"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:50 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
