While these cinemas are diverse operating within specific national, historical, cultural, religious, industrial, stylistic, and authorial paradigms and aspirations, there are many fascinating similarities and affinities in the resulting films in terms of narrative, theme, performance, visual style, and representation of women and minorities. <br/><br/>There is at least one textbook for the course and additional readings for each week that are posted on the Canvas. Each session includes a lecture on the readings and films, class discussion of the readings and films, and a film screening. All film screenings take place in class. Assignments consist of five reaction papers and two term papers. There are also required discussion sessions with TAs."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:50 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
