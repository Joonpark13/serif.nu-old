[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This intermediate/advanced technique class focuses on improving alignment, building strength, and increasing whole body awareness and dexterity within and through the codified exercises and enchainment of classical ballet. In the progression from barre to center, the class encourages the discovery and understanding of the anatomy and kinesiology involved in the sound execution of classical movements and positions and a rigorous engagement of mind and body in the quest towards physical virtuosity and performance presence. The class also looks at the ways in which classical ballet technique can inform and be informed by other modes of contemporary dance training.", "name": "Ballet III", "section": "21", "topic": "", "course": "370-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 8:00AM - 9:20AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SoC/DANCE/370-0/11185", "instructor": ["Vanessa   Valecillos"], "id": "11185", "subject": "DANCE"}]
