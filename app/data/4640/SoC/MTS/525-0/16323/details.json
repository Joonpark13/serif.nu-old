This course explains how the preferences and habits of media users, the strategies and constraints of media makers, and the growing prevalence of media metrics form a dynamic marketplace that shapes public attention. Topics include theories of media choice, the role of social networks, sharing economies, audience-making strategies, bias in measurement, recommender systems, big data, audience fragmentation, and how digital media affect the public sphere and global civil society."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Webster, J.
