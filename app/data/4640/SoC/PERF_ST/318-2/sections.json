[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Adaptation as performance history: one way to approach an old play is to study its reshaping by artists in later ages. The course takes this approach to Shakespeare's tragedy King Lear. Offshoots of King Lear range from Nahum Tate's substantial &quot;re-modelling,&quot; first published in 1681, to Jean-Luc Godard's 1987 cinematic fantasy, developed in the immediate aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. The course examines a wide range of adaptations, including: Grigori Kosintsev's 1971 film, which makes Lear into an allegorical reflection upon the horrors of life in the mid-twentieth century; Peter Brook's Beckett-inflected film adaptation from 1971; Samuel Beckett's drama Endgame; Akira Kurosawa's film Ran; and Jane Smiley's 1991 novel A Thousand Acres, which tells a Lear-like story about a family on an American farm. <br/><br/>THEATRE CREDIT. This course satisfies one unit of the &quot;History, Literature, and Criticism&quot; requirement in the Theatre Department.", "name": "Shakespeare Adaptations", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "318-2", "meeting_time": ["WeFr 3:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SoC/PERF_ST/318-2/17511", "instructor": ["Paul C Edwards"], "id": "17511", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
