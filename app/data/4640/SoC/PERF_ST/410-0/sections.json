[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This class provides conceptual and practical tools to help students devise their performance recital. Through critical essays and performance workshops, the course engages performance as analytical lens, research method, and event. The course gives students the opportunity to explore aspects such as text, space, image, story, and document from an aesthetic and a theoretical perspective. What are the issues that are central to studies of performance when bodies are on display or when a story is communicated to an audience? In what ways does a poetic rendition of an ethnographic interview make a statement about the politics of the research process disrupting notions of linearity and authority that are central to Western epistemology? How do narrative voice choices impact the politics of a performance? The aim of the course is to explore performance as a meaning-making practice, paying close attention to the role of embodied behavior in the production, interpretation, and dissemination of knowledge.", "name": "Studies in Performance", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "410-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 4:00PM - 6:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SoC/PERF_ST/410-0/17050", "instructor": ["Deidra Soyin Madison"], "id": "17050", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
