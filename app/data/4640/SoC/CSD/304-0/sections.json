[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "An understanding of how to properly design experiments and analyze their results is essential to the study of Communication Sciences and Disorders. Sound design logically isolates the cause or causes of an effect. Given a sound design it remains a possibility that the results of an experiment originate not from the supposed cause but instead from random factors present in an experiment. This course will cover a range of statistical techniques appropriate for evaluating the relative influence of chance vs. effect factors in various kinds of experiments. You will learn how and when to use these techniques and how to properly interpret statistical results that will support or refute a hypothesis. A primary goal of the course is to allow you to become a critical reader and interpreter of the research literature in CSD.", "name": "Statistics in Communication Sciences and Disorders", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "304-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SoC/CSD/304-0/11016", "instructor": ["Steven G Zecker"], "id": "11016", "subject": "CSD"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "Statistics in Communication Sciences and Disorders", "section": "21", "topic": "", "course": "304-0", "meeting_time": ["TBA"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SoC/CSD/304-0/19173", "instructor": ["Steven G Zecker"], "id": "19173", "subject": "CSD"}]
