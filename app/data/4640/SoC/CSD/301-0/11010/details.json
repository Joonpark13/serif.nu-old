The course begins with a description of basic properties of cells, tissues and systems common to all parts of the body. The course then proceeds through each of three systems important for speech production: the respiratory, laryngeal and articulatory systems. In each system, anatomy of the structural components are first presented, i.e., bones, soft tissues and muscles, followed by presentations of the physiological interactions of the structural features. Within each system, various disease and pathological conditions that relate to speech production are also presented. The lectures are augmented by a weekly lab session in which students are exposed to dissections of cadaveric material."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "NONE"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "The course is primarily lecture, however, questions and discussion of various issues is encouraged."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "There are two midterm examinations, a laboratory final exam and a course final exam."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Zemlin, W.
