[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Exploration of the structural and functional intricacies of the upper aerodigestive tract and concepts of motor control and learning as they pertain to speech and swallowing. Anatomical structures and physiology of the speech mechanism, including oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal structures and the respiratory system are reviewed and theories of motor control and learning are introduced. Clinical scenarios and populations provide the context for concept exploration.", "name": "Clinical Speech Anatomy, Physiology, and Motor Control", "section": "20", "location": "Frances Searle Building 1441", "topic": "", "course": "455-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SoC/CSD/455-0/11175", "instructor": ["Stacy Lyn Kaplan"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "11175", "subject": "CSD"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "Clinical Speech Anatomy, Physiology, and Motor Control", "section": "21", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "455-0", "meeting_time": ["TBA"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SoC/CSD/455-0/19180", "instructor": ["Stacy Lyn Kaplan"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "19180", "subject": "CSD"}]
