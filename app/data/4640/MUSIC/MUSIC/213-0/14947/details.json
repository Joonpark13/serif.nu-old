We will approach various musical cultures comparatively and explore the themes of globalization, postcolonialism, emotion, economics, ritual, music theater, aesthetics, and the production local identities. In addition to providing an introduction to music's role in making our globalized modernity, this course asks students to reflect critically on their own music making and to situate it within a broader history and geography of practices. Required work for the class consists of active participation in classroom discussion, a collaborative soundscape documentation project, occasional pop quizzes on assigned readings, two examinations, and other assignments to be determined."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:33 PM (CT)", "subject": "MUSIC"}]
