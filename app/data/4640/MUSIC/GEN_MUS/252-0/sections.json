[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "The primary goal of this class is to gain fluency in the vocabulary and elements of common-practice tonal music: its notation, construction, and modes of analysis. While emphasis will be placed on harmonic structure and function, through analysis exercises and ear training, we will also discuss other factors that contribute to our enjoyment and understanding of music, such as rhythm, meter, and melodic construction. This class is for non-music majors only.", "name": "Harmony", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "252-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MUSIC/GEN_MUS/252-0/14904", "instructor": ["Natasha   Stojanovska"], "id": "14904", "subject": "GEN_MUS"}]
