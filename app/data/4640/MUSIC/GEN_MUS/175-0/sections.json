The only prerequisite is a love of the performing arts. You do NOT have to read, perform, or understand music notation to succeed in this course. However, you have to be prepared to spend time attending concerts and listening to examples of classical music (minimally six hours a week) outside of the two required in-class sessions. During classroom sessions and outside work, the instructor and invited guests will attempt to nurture a heightened awareness of the challenges that conductors, opera and music theater directors, and musicians/actors face when preparing for a performance. Through a series of observations, presentations, interviews, and interactive discussions/seminars, you will be better prepared to listen, observe, and critically analyze performing arts events on and off campus during this academic quarter and hopefully for the rest of your life. An individualized assessment contract will be negotiated during the first two weeks of the quarter. In general, evaluation will be based on engagement in the various course components, including: completion of weekly readings and listening assignments to be documented in a course log and preparation of two collaborative oral/written presentations.", "name": "Selected Topics in Music Literature for Non-Majors", "section": "22", "topic": "Demystifying Classical Music", "course": "175-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MUSIC/GEN_MUS/175-0/14902", "instructor": ["Bernard J Dobroski"], "id": "14902", "subject": "GEN_MUS"}]
