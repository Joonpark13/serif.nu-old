Our attention will be directed equally toward modernist art music, popular genres (jazz, vaudeville, Broadway), and the relationships that developed between them during the 1920s. We will also briefly examine the responses of European composers and listeners to the new directions in American music. An interdisciplinary approach will frequently place music alongside visual art and architecture, literature and theatre, choreography and cinematography, and the following set of issues will recur often in our discussions: How were modernity, race, gender, sexuality, and national identity \"performed\" during the Jazz Age? What significance did new audio technologies?radio, the phonograph, film sound?have for the decade's soundscape and for the experience of listening? Composers and performers to be discussed will include George Gershwin, Aaron Copland, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Edgard Var\u00e8se, Ruth Crawford, Bessie Smith, Al Jolson, and many others, culminating in a study of two key works from 1927: Jerome Kern's Broadway musical Show Boat, and the first feature-length \"talking picture,\" The Jazz Singer.
