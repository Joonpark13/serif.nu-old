[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "An aptitude for musicality counts among the few positive stereotypes commonly directed toward the diasporic Gypsy or Roma peoples of Europe. The practitioners of distinct folkloric musical traditions, the Roma have been evoked in the Western classical tradition since at least the eighteenth century through a system of gestural stereotypes, and such representation continues today in the marketing practices of the world music industry. How has the music of this minority been appropriated, mimicked, and altered over time? What is the relationship between the folkloric musics of the Roma and their evocation in other repertoires? This class will attempt to answer such questions by focusing on a variety of repertoires performed or inspired by the Roma people, especially Roma music from Hungary and Spain, and also from the Balkans, and its roots in India; Andalucian flamenco; 19th-century opera (Bizet's Carmen, Verdi's La traviata); instrumental works by Haydn, Liszt, Brahms, and J. Strauss; Django Reinhardt; and more recent &quot;world&quot; music phenomena such as the Gipsy Kings. The relationship of Roma identity to the writings of Liszt and Bart\u00f3k will also be considered. Using perspectives of historical musicology, ethnomusicology, and popular music studies, students will explore the dialogic relationship between the Roma and classical and popular musics over the past 200 years.", "name": "Music and Gypsies", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "332-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MUSIC/MUSICOL/332-0/15862", "instructor": ["Drew Edward Davies"], "id": "15862", "subject": "MUSICOL"}]
