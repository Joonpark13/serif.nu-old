[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "<html><b>Opera and Aesthetic Controversy in 18th-century France</b><br/>Across the 18th century, opera in France was the focal point of a series of querelles - battles, carried out in print. These pamphlet wars argued the merits of Lully's established style vs. Rameau's modern sound; of the French tragic tradition vs. the new comic opera imported from Italy; for or against the opera reforms of Gluck. The debates, and the topic of opera more generally, attracted some of the era's leading philosophes and other intellectual figures, too, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau (who also tried his hand at opera composition) and Denis Diderot. Further, scholars have shown that the querelles were never just about music: opera was entwined here with key political and philosophical debates of the age. In this course we will study several operas that were heard in Paris in the 18th century and played a role in these querelles, including Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie, Rousseau's Le devin du village, and the competing versions by Gluck and Piccinni of Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride, among others. We will also read a broad selection of 18th-century French writings (in translation) on music, language, and aesthetics. While getting to know this operatic repertoire in depth, students will further gain an appreciation of how aesthetic controversy may both respond to and shape musical culture.</html>", "name": "Topics in 18th Century Music", "section": "20", "topic": "Opera/Aesthetics in France", "course": "353-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MUSIC/MUSICOL/353-0/14994", "instructor": ["Scott Douglas Paulin"], "id": "14994", "subject": "MUSICOL"}]
