[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "<html><br/><b><br/>Composing within and for Improvising Ensemble: Navigating Freedom and Systems</b><br/>In this performance-focused course we will investigate techniques of writing for and performing with large improvising ensemble. The music of Duke Ellington, Anthony Braxton, Cornelius Cardew, Ornette Coleman, Pauline Oliveros, Butch Morris, Cecil Taylor, and others will provide frameworks. In addition to exploring specific works and systems developed by these innovators, we will experiment with &quot;free&quot; improvisation. All students will be expected to perform with and compose original works for the group.<br/><br/></html>", "name": "Class Composition", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "311-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MUSIC/MUS_COMP/311-1/15051", "instructor": ["Katherine Andrews Young"], "id": "15051", "subject": "MUS_COMP"}]
