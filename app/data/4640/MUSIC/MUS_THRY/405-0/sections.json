It will center around intensive, student-driven reading and discussion of current research. We will read widely across various areas within the field, considering questions such as the following:<br/><ul><br/><li>What is the nature of evidence in the field of music theory?</li> <br/><li>What kinds of questions has music theory asked?</li><br/><li>What kinds of agendas seem to inform or guide music theory (including unacknowledged ones)? </li><br/><li>What kinds of representations are used in music-theoretical arguments? What do they represent? </li> <br/><li>What qualities and features are involved in an effective musical analysis? In what ways might analysis be involved in developing a larger argument?</li><br/><li>What kinds of things can music-theoretical arguments accomplish? How might the scope of such arguments be expanded?</li></ul></p></html>", "name": "Introduction to Research Methods in Music Theory and Cognition", "section": "20", "location": "RCMA Lower Level 113", "topic": "", "course": "405-0", "meeting_time": ["We 1:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MUSIC/MUS_THRY/405-0/15726", "instructor": ["Mark Jonathan Butler"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "15726", "subject": "MUS_THRY"}]
