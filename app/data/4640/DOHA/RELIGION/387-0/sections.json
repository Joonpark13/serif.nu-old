[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "<p>Political histories of the Middle East frequently neglect the intellectual currents and religious movements preoccupying large segments of the Muslim world. Islamic renewal and reform movements since the nineteenth century have had dramatic effects on the region. This course explores the origin and development of key religious movements such as Wahhabism, Salafism, \"neo-Sufism,\" the Muslim Brotherhood, and millenarian movements. By interrogating the nature of renewal and reform, and the influence of modernity on movements of change, we will evaluate the extent of doctrinal and social change occasioned by such movements in the last two centuries. The course is divided into two parts: nineteenth and twentieth century reform movements. Each section additionally focuses on a separate methodological issue: the first being the definition of reform in Muslim religious thought; and the second being the shape of Islam's dialogue with modernity.</p>", "name": "Advanced Topics in Religion Studies:", "section": "70", "location": "Carnegie Mellon Room 3204", "topic": "Modern Reform Movmnts in the Muslim World", "course": "387-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 01:30PM - 02:50PM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/DOHA/RELIGION/387-0/10047", "instructor": ["Zachary Valentine Wright"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "10047", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
