It is designed to help a student become a more efficient and successful writer by also strengthening skills in reading and analyzing texts. It recognizes that writing is indeed a process. This means that whether a writer starts with a thesis, an outline, or an assigned topic, there will be many steps and missteps involved in producing the final essay. Multiple phases of the writing process will be carried out, such as workshop, peer review, and one-on-one conferences with the instructor. Each semester, a different theme will serve as a focal topic for readings, discussions, and writing assignments.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Mandatory for all first year students</li><br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
