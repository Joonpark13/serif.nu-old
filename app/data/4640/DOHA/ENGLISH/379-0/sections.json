[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "<p>America is uniquely a country of immigrants. It is made up of people whose cultural origins are connected to other societies with their own languages, religions, customs, and fundamental values. The American experiment has succeeded in bringing disparate peoples together in a democratic society but sometimes at enormous cost in hardship and disillusionment. The &quot;human&quot; cost of this immigration/migration experience has best been expressed in the fiction written by the people involved. Students will learn how to read closely and critically; how to develop a distinctive voice in their writing; and how to become confident in asking questions and framing persuasive answers. Students will also acquire a technical and critical vocabulary for analyzing various forms of literature and apply this vocabulary to their written analyses. Ultimately, students will have a more nuanced understanding of the sacrifices and benefits; the gains and losses that are all a part of the American immigration experience.</p>", "name": "Special Topics:", "section": "70", "topic": "American (Im)Migrant Literature", "course": "379-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 04:00PM - 05:20PM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/DOHA/ENGLISH/379-0/10050", "instructor": ["Tracy L Vaughn"], "id": "10050", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
