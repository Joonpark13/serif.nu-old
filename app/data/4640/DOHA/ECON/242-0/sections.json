[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "<p>This introductory course studies basic economic concepts and theories. It is divided into two main parts: microeconomics and topics on macroeconomics. The module examines central economic ideas including supply and demand, market structures, consumers, public policy and monopoly as well as macroeconomic indicators such as gross domestic product, inflation and unemployment. Issues on economic growth, financial systems and capital markets are also discussed (including Islamic finance).Whenever possible, examples from Qatar and other economies in the Gulf region will be used to illustrate the material being discussed. The content and delivery of the course is suitable to students who are not pursuing a major in economics. Topics are discussed in a relatively nontechnical way. Analytical explanations will focus on graphs rather than mathematics.</p>", "name": "Principles of Economics", "section": "70", "location": "Carnegie Mellon Room 3048", "topic": "", "course": "242-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 06:00PM - 07:20PM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/DOHA/ECON/242-0/10052", "instructor": ["Giovanni   Bandi"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "10052", "subject": "ECON"}]
