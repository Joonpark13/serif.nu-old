[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "<p>This course will provide students with a conceptual vocabulary and theoretical framework that will help them become critical consumers and efficient producers of argumentative deliberation, a crucial component of decision-making and communication. Specifically, students will study the essential components and basic framework of an argumentative message (as elucidated by Stephen Toulmin). They will apply this framework in analyses of persuasive messages and public controversies. Students will also study and apply the basic debating processes of refutation, defense, and counterargument. This conventional study of argumentation will be supplemented with reflections on argumentation via narrative and argumentation via visual texts. Coursework will consist of readings, lectures, and discussions. Students will be evaluated through quizzes, short papers, and presentations.<br/>By the end of this course, students will be able to: (1) use Toulmin's conceptual framework to analyze and evaluate argumentative messages; (2) use Toulmin's conceptual framework to construct argumentative messages of their own; (3) enter into an on-going debate on a controversial issue by offering refutations of and counterarguments to prevailing positions as well as a compelling defense of their own position; (4) analyze, evaluate, and construct arguments presented in the form of narratives; and (5) analyze, evaluate, and construct arguments presented in the form of visual texts.</p>", "name": "Theories of Argumentation", "section": "70", "topic": "", "course": "206-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 10:30AM - 11:50AM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/DOHA/MIT/206-0/10020", "instructor": ["Allwyn   Tellis"], "id": "10020", "subject": "MIT"}]
