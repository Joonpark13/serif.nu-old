In addition to learning the fundamental theories of freedom of expression, students will immerse themselves in the law of defamation, intellectual property and privacy through case studies and in-class exercises that emphasize the application of those principles in a global setting. Throughout the course, attention will be paid to reading primary source materials, including Qatari laws that regulate the media.
