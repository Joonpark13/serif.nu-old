Today Africa may well be the only continent in the world with a Muslim majority. How did Islam come to have such primacy in African history? What are the currents of Islamic thought that have come to shape African lives? How did Africans affect Islamic religious culture? This course aims to answer such questions with an overview of fourteen centuries of Islam in Africa. Although not an exhaustive history, we will outline major historical shifts, consider broad intellectual currents and discuss some of the main historiographical debates surrounding Islam in Africa.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to juniors and above</li> <br/><li>Open for Cross-Registration</li><br/><li>Satisfying Middle East Studies certificate</li><br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
