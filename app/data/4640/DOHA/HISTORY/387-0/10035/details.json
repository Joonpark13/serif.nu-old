From the middle of the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century Britain tried to control territory from Egypt to the Gulf. Of course, locals had their own ideas. Sometimes local populations worked with the British and sometimes they fought the British. The result was a series of compromises and conflicts that over a hundred years shaped the geography, politics and culture of the modern Middle East. This course explores the origins, evolution and legacy of that British involvement in the Middle East.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to sophomores and above</li> <br/><li>Open for Cross-Registration</li><br/><li>Satisfying Middle East Studies certificate</li><br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
