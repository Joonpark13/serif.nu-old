The use of oil wealth by the Gulf states has hastened some sociopolitical changes and stagnated others. Studying inclusion and exclusion in citizenship laws and norms gives insight into legal and emotional concepts of national identity and nation building. Exploring the tensions between increased economic and educational opportunities for women and cultural and religious barriers highlights the struggle between modernization and tradition in the region today. Political readings are combined with literature from the Gulf region. Students should end the class with a better understanding of the rapid development and transformation of Gulf society and politics, and the challenges still facing the region.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to freshmen and sophomores</li> <br/><li>Open for Cross-Registration</li><br/><li>Satisfying Middle East Studies certificate</li><br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
