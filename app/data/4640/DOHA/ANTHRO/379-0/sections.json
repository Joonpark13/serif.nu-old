[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "<p>In this course, students explore anthropological perspectives on gender. They will learn about people's gendered practices, knowledges and everyday lives in a range of societies. They will tackle debates in the field of gender studies and explore these debates through ethnographies. How are femininity and masculinity defined and embodied across cultures? How do race, class, religion and sexuality intersect with gender? How is mobility gendered? We will explore these and other questions, and analyze the way feminist intellectuals have troubled gender and opened up new spaces of thinking. The class will work together on an ethnographic project that explores the way mobility and space are gendered in Qatar.</p>", "name": "Advanced Topics in Anthropology", "section": "70", "location": "Carnegie Mellon Room 3177", "topic": "Troubling Gender: Anthro persp", "course": "379-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 10:30AM - 11:50AM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/DOHA/ANTHRO/379-0/10045", "instructor": ["Sami   Hermez"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "10045", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
