Key questions are: 1) What makes an educational environment democratic? 2) What is the role of the teacher in facilitating democracy in the music classroom? 3) Are the current structures for teaching music inherently undemocratic or do they simply require rethinking to be more sensitive to allowing greater student contributions? and 4) How does a democratic approach to music education influence the content, repertoire and standards of the music classroom? The course will be designed around three books that approach these issue from different perspectives."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:34 PM (CT)", "subject": "MUSIC_ED"}]
