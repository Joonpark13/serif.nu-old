We will consider late twentieth- and early twenty-first century histories and theories of gender and sexuality, particularly of the periods in question, as well as key ideas that are especially applicable to early modern constructs of the body, selfhood, and gender identity, such as cross-dressing, castration, and forms of desire. The course is open to any graduate student with previous course work on the early modern era OR gender &amp; sexuality studies, in any subject or department. In true seminar style, class meetings will consist of discussion of shared material plus presentations by individual students based on their particular interests within each set of topical parameters. It is hoped that, collectively, we can answer some of the open questions about gender and sexuality of the early modern era by using musical evidence, one of the fields most likely to be overlooked by professional scholars of the histories of gender and sexuality. Other evidence will come from the histories of philosophy and medicine, visual arts, religious history, and material culture, especially as they intersect with early modern ideas of music."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:34 PM (CT)", "subject": "MUSICOL"}]
