[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "This course introduces students to the practice and philosophy of writing music history and is intended for music graduate students and undergraduate musicology majors, though other interested students are welcome. It surveys a range of historiographic methods and theories practiced in musicology since the late 19th century. Students will engage critically with both music historiography and general historiography. Reading will be heavy and participation in classroom discussion will count towards half of the final grade. Students will also work closely with primary source materials in special collections and collaboratively produce an exhibition in Deering Library that will open during finals week. The class will culminate in a symposium in which students will present their original research in conjunction with the exhibition opening. This is a writing intensive course.", "name": "Selected Topics", "section": "20", "location": "RCMA Lower Level 113", "topic": "Music Historiography", "course": "335-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MUSIC/MUSICOL/335-0/14992", "instructor": ["Ryan Wayne Dohoney"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "14992", "subject": "MUSICOL"}]
