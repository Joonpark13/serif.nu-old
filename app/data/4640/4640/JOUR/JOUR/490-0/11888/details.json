Students will be exposed to interviewing and observational techniques from anthropology, psychology, and sociology; interpretive techniques from literature, psychology, and business strategy; and creative methods and prototyping techniques from engineering, design, marketing, and advertising. By the end of this course, students will have a firm grounding in how to study a small number of people, uncover patterns in their thinking and behavior that point to design opportunities for news media products and services, and understand how to quickly test and improve ideas that solve for these opportunities. This course has roots in, and a similar arc to, fundamental design research courses taught in major design programs, inside major corporations, by influential consultancies, and in the most prominent startup accelerator, Matter Ventures. <br/> <br/>Instructors: Pete Mortensen (associate at Matter Ventures - https://www.linkedin.com/in/morepete) &amp; Hema Padhu (startup marketing consultant - https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemapadhu) <br/>\u00b7 SCHEDULE: Mondays 6-9pm (tentative - may change)"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
