Our goal is to help you become a more seasoned, savvy, multi-dimensional and fleet-footed journalist and beat reporter. Working closely with a faculty member as your primary editor, you will focus on finding, cultivating and interviewing sources on a beat; cover breaking and enterprise stories on and off that beat; publish to myriad platforms; and occasionally work in teams. One of the main objectives is to give you experience in the rigors, realities and risks of the constant news cycle that is the norm today."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
