The integrated marketing communications solution is for a live case study in which direct-to-consumer communications and sales via the internet play a vital role. Students approach this case as if they were consultants leading the strategic marketing plan. The students design a plan for a class sponsor that will substantially grow the business over the next three years. This strategic plan will include, but not be limited to, vision and mission, market segmentation, brand positioning and strategy, acquisition and retention strategies, as well as tactical ideas for each strategy, and financial justification for the plan."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:45 PM (CT)", "subject": "IMC"}]
