By viewing and analyzing excellent video pieces ? on journalistic and non-news digital platforms ? we will learn what makes a story powerful. We'll see how the masters of storytelling appeal to our senses and take us on a journey that helps an audience understand a complex issue or cause. We'll look at how character, images and a careful plotting of story beats affect the viewer ? in documentary shorts, short videos for NGOs as well as political and corporate image pieces. Coursework will include readings, classroom discussions, analyses of stories and a final project, done in groups, producing a video story for a local client."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:45 PM (CT)", "subject": "IMC"}]
