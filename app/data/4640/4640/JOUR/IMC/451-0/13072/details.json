Students learn to define the research problem and select an appropriate research design. The course covers descriptive and causal research, questionnaire design, sampling and experimental design, univariate and multivariate descriptive statistics, confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for means and percents. The course also addresses ways of creating visual displays to present the findings from a marketing research study. Topics from probability theory are also covered including conditional probabilities and independence, discrete, binomial and normal random variables, and sampling distributions. Students learn how to analyze customer databases and surveys using statistical software."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "There are no specific prerequisites for this course, but previous exposure to statistics in college-level courses will be helpful. This course covers many of the topics that are typically included in undergraduate statistics courses, but in greater depth and with an emphasis on marketing communication applications. Occasionally we will also discuss applications from areas that are closely linked to but not part of IMC, such as finance or economics."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "IMC"}]
