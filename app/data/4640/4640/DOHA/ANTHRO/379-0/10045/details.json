They will learn about people's gendered practices, knowledges and everyday lives in a range of societies. They will tackle debates in the field of gender studies and explore these debates through ethnographies. How are femininity and masculinity defined and embodied across cultures? How do race, class, religion and sexuality intersect with gender? How is mobility gendered? We will explore these and other questions, and analyze the way feminist intellectuals have troubled gender and opened up new spaces of thinking. The class will work together on an ethnographic project that explores the way mobility and space are gendered in Qatar.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to juniors and above</li> <br/><li>Open for Cross-Registration</li><br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
