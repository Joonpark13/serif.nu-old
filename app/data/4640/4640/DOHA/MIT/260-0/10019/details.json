Students will prepare for entry into the professional world by learning how outside forces can influence the screenwriter's decisions. Through the practice of screenwriting, students will: (1) learn how to represent in words not only story, but also sound design, editing, visual design, and other elements of media making; (2) discover how core concepts of character, structure, plot, theme, and tone interact within existing and emerging media forms, and (3) explore a variety of films, topics, and exercises that will provide inspiration for a piece of original work of personal significance. By the end of the course, students will be able to: (1) write in professional screenplay style and format; (2) generate compelling scenes, characters, and stories, and distinguish between derivative, obvious choices and honest, original alternatives that affect and move an audience; (3) think like a screenwriter, applying the language of constructive screenplay development and criticism to their own work as well as to the work of others.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to sophomores and above</li> <br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "MIT"}]
