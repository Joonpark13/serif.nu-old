[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "How has digital media transformed our sense of self and our relationships with others? In this course, we will attempt to answer this question by studying contemporary and historical media research from a variety of fields, including neurology, social science, philosophy, media studies, and communication studies. Students will participate in group work and self reflection activities intended to help them analyze and evaluate the role that digital media plays in their lives. They will practice using different interpretive strategies and analytical tools to help them determine the social and cultural impact of digital media. We will pay special attention to the influence of digital media on conceptions of self and community, so that we may better understand how digital media affects how we work, play, learn, and communicate with one another.<br/><br/>This course will be conducted completely online. A technology fee assessed for online courses will be added to tuition at the time of registration. All materials, lectures, and other interactions will take place through the course Canvas site. Each week, students will learn about a particular topic through readings, videos, mini-lectures, and podcasts. Then they will participate in online discussions and complete homework related to the topic. Several times throughout the quarter, we will also meet for real-time video conferences. The course will be highly interactive, and students will work with each other and with the instructor every week. <br/><br/><br/>This course is part of the Business Leadership year two cohort.", "name": "Topics in Communication Studies", "section": "17", "location": "TBA", "topic": "Digital Media and Society", "course": "395-DL", "meeting_time": ["TBA"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SCS/COMM_ST/395-DL/18427", "instructor": ["Mary Morley   Cohen"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "18427", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
