[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "For novice fiction writers, ENGLISH 207 will introduce students to the narrative necessities for creating character -driven literary fiction. The course will start off with close reading of published short stories and writing exercises, which will help you to recognize and apply such components of fiction as conflict, characterization, setting, use of detail, and more. Students will then embark on the creation of their own short stories, which will be workshopped in class so as to provide constructive feedback for revisions. A completed short story will be due at the end of the quarter.", "name": "Reading and Writing Fiction", "section": "14", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 516", "topic": "", "course": "207-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SCS/ENGLISH/207-CN/18435", "instructor": ["Lisa A Stolley"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "18435", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
