[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Immunobiology is the study of the response of higher organisms to foreign substances and pathogenic<br/>organisms. We will examine the role of the immune system in both health and disease. The field of<br/>immunobiology integrates recent developments and techniques in molecular biology, cell biology, and<br/>physiology. The emphasis of this course will be on the human immune system and how its successes,<br/>failures and compromises affect our lives. Students will understand how disorders such as HIV/AIDS,<br/>cancer, and autoimmune diseases develop in the context of a failed or over-active immune system.", "name": "Immunobiology", "section": "16", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 417", "topic": "", "course": "355-CN", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SCS/BIOL_SCI/355-CN/18420", "instructor": ["Steven J Anderson"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "18420", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
