You will become familiar with practical approaches for how to structure innovation processes (e.g. stage-gate processes, collaborative/open innovation), how to evaluate innovations (e.g. with regards to technological, market, organizational, and relational risks), and how to ensure innovations' contribution to the bottom line.
