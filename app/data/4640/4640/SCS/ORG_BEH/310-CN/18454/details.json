Today's emphasis on quality, service, and efficiency has created great urgency for change that runs counter to other factors (e.g., a mobile labor force, uninspired leadership, and intense global economic pressures). The byproduct is often cynicism, self-preservation, and confusion-ingredients for disaster. Yet some organizations thrive; this course examines why, and explores change drivers and dynamics across organizational settings and situations ranging from major corporate mergers to not-for-profit politics. This course combines classroom lecture and discussion with an online component. This course will meet on 9/3, 9/10, 9/17 in an intensive format. This course is part of the Business Leadership year two cohort."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:56 PM (CT)", "subject": "ORG_BEH"}]
