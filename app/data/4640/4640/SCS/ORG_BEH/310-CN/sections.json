[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an in-depth investigation of the forces driving organizational change and their impact on people and structure. Today's emphasis on quality, service, and efficiency has created great urgency for change that runs counter to other factors (e.g., a mobile labor force, uninspired leadership, and intense global economic pressures). The byproduct is often cynicism, self-preservation, and confusion-ingredients for disaster. Yet some organizations thrive; this course examines why, and explores change drivers and dynamics across organizational settings and situations ranging from major corporate mergers to not-for-profit politics. This course combines classroom lecture and discussion with an online component. This course will meet on 9/3, 9/10, 9/17 in an intensive format. This course is part of the Business Leadership year two cohort.", "name": "Organizational Change", "section": "17", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 406", "topic": "", "course": "310-CN", "meeting_time": ["Sa 9:00AM - 5:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SCS/ORG_BEH/310-CN/18454", "instructor": ["Aleen Marcia Bayard"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "18454", "subject": "ORG_BEH"}]
