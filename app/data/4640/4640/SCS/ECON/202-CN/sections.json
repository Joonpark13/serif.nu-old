[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "In a market economy, the interaction of buyers and sellers in many connected markets governs how the economy's resources are allocated. Market prices are determined by the decisions of all consumers and firms but mostly taken as given by any individual. We will construct models of the behavior of consumers and firms, and of the determination of prices in markets under a variety of conditions. We will examine the properties of the allocations, especially their efficiency, and the role of the government in these matters.", "name": "Introduction to Economics II: Microeconomics", "section": "14", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 409", "topic": "", "course": "202-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SCS/ECON/202-CN/18429", "instructor": ["Katheryn Rae DeVelvis"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "18429", "subject": "ECON"}]
