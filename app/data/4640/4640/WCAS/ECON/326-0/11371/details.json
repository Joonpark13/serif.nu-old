The emphasis will be on microeconomic issues. We will ask such questions as &quot;Do the poor under-invest in education and health?&quot; and &quot;What types of public policies can be used to improve the well-being of people living in developing countries?&quot; Other topics include microfinance, informal insurance, corruption, and the productivity of firms in developing countries. An important objective is to learn how to use both the theoretical and empirical tools of economics to investigate the questions above. Therefore, econometric techniques and theoretical models will feature prominently in the course."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Economics: 281, 310-1,2, 311"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Two lectures a week."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Evaluation will be based on one mid-term, one final, four assignments, and class participation"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "<i>Development Economics</i>, by Debraj Ray, 1998 (ISBN: 978-0691017068)<br/><i>Poor Economics</i>, by Abhjit Banerjee and Esther Duflo (ISBN: 978-1586487980)<br/>Additional readings will be assigned as the quarter goes on."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:03 PM (CT)", "subject": "ECON"}]
