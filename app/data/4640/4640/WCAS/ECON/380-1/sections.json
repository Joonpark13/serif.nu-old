It is used widely to reason about economic, political, social and biological phenomena. This course will present some of the basic ideas of game theory. The focus will be on the abstract concepts and their analysis rather than on the substance of the applications. While this course will not rely on wide knowledge of economics and will not use sophisticated mathematical techniques, it will be be fairly rigorous and will require an ability to follow closely reasoned arguments and solve problems.", "name": "Game Theory", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 102", "topic": "", "course": "380-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ECON/380-1/11345", "instructor": ["Asher   Wolinsky"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "11345", "subject": "ECON"}]
