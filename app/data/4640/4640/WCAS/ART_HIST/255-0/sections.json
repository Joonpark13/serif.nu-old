[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course introduces the concept of modernism in art. The historical period we call modernity?defined by industrialization, urbanization, colonization, the rise of mass commodity culture, mass spectacle and technology, revolution and mass war, as well as the emergence of the art market as we know it today?has been called both a dreamworld and a catastrophe. Modernist art was its harbinger and spokesperson, optimistically mimicking the new forms of modernity's mass visual culture or, more commonly, reworking or rejecting those forms in a critical commentary on both society and the artistic conventions that upheld its inequities. Proceeding from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century, primarily in Europe, we will examine the key modernist \"isms\": Impressionism, Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Suprematism, Constructivism, Purism and Socialist Realism, as well as the rise of abstraction culminating in Abstract Expressionism.", "name": "Introduction to Modernism", "section": "1", "location": "Block Pick-Laudati Auditorium", "topic": "", "course": "255-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ART_HIST/255-0/10592", "instructor": ["Christina Hilleboe Kiaer"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>Interdisciplinary Distro - See Rules<br/><br/>Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "10592", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
