The key artistic practices studied in the course are those of David, Goya, Ingres, Daumier, G\u00e9ricault, Delacroix, Blake and Constable. The rise of major metropolises (London and Paris) and their public and private buildings will likewise be important points of focus. Major themes will be the rise of an art for the public, art and revolution, art and empire, the invention of Orientalism and Romanticism, caricature and the press, new image technologies (including photography), and the rise of landscape painting and portraiture. The course subtitle may as well be: Sex, Violence, Politics, Big Cities, and the Land. A unique feature of the class will be its three professors: all renowned experts in the field. They will be teaching together in 2016-17 for the first and last time. The course has already gained a nickname: 19th-c.
