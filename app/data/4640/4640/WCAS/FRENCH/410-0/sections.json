[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The Troubadours and the Occitan Tradition: Lyrics in a Manuscript Context<br/><br/>This seminar will provide a comprehensive introduction to the poetry of the Occitan troubadours, their language, and their influence on literary traditions. The troubadours flourished in the south of France during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, producing a dazzlingly innovative corpus of lyric poetry, which exercised a profound influence on the emergence of literature in other European vernaculars. In addition to studying troubadour lyrics in their original language, we will also think critically about issues related to orality, textuality and the role of literary \"traditions\" in the construction of cultural and national identities. This course will include study of the Occitan language and close work with medieval manuscripts.", "name": "Studies in Medieval Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 109", "topic": "The Troubadours and the Occitan Tradition: Lyrics", "course": "410-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 3:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/FRENCH/410-0/12157", "instructor": ["Christopher John Davis"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "12157", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
