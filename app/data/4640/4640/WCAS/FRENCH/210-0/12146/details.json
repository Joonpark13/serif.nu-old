But is love itself constant? Is love a universal human emotion or does it change depending on place, time and the medium of expression? What might a study of love literature reveal about evolving attitudes towards gender, sexuality and the body? How might representations of love help us to understand other historical developments in politics, culture, and the role of the individual in society? This class will study the changing role of love in French literature from the Middle Ages to the Baroque (17th century) period. We will read works of lyric poetry, narrative and drama, including the Lais of Marie de France, the poetry of Pierre de Ronsard, and Jean Racine's Ph\u00e8dre. Readings, discussions and written work in French."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:04 PM (CT)", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
