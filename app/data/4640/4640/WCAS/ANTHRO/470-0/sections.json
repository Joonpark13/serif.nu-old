[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will attempt the impossible-to survey the development of anthropological theory in a single quarter. Needless to say, it will not and cannot be exhaustive. Instead, it will focus on the careful scrutiny of a few primary sources by prominent individuals who have contributed to the development of the discipline, but who will also be taken as \"representative\" of various historical trends. The first part of the course will rapidly outline the prehistory of the discipline and focus more extensively on the notion of evolution central to 19th century social theory. The second part of the course will deal with the individual contributions of three \"founding fathers\": Marx, Durkheim and Weber. The final part of the course will cover a few of the numerous trends of 20th century cultural anthropology.", "name": "History of Anthropological Theory", "section": "1", "location": "ANTHRO Sem Rm 104 - 1810 Hinmn", "topic": "", "course": "470-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 4:00PM - 6:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ANTHRO/470-0/10126", "instructor": ["Robert   Launay"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "10126", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
