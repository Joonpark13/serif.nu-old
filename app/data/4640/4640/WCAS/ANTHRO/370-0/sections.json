[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Rather than attempting the impossible-an overview of the whole history of the discipline of anthropology-this course will focus on one particular problem: the relationship between theory and ethnographic description in cultural Anthropology. The course will attempt to survey the development of certain schools of thought in the discipline since the mid-nineteenth century: evolutionism; historical particularism; structural-functionalism; culture and personality; cultural materialism; interpretive anthropology. In order to examine the ways in which each of these theoretical approaches affects the ways in which anthropologists choose to describe what they observe, the class will read a series of ethnographies (or excerpts from larger works) written at different times from different points of view.", "name": "Anthropology in Historical Perspective", "section": "20", "location": "ANTHRO Sem Rm 104 - 1810 Hinmn", "topic": "", "course": "370-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ANTHRO/370-0/10085", "instructor": ["Robert   Launay"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "10085", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
