This course examines one of the best-known pre-Columbian civilizations<br/><br/>in the New World: Ancient Maya civilization. The course will focus on the<br/><br/>achievements of the ancient Maya - considered one of the most advanced<br/><br/>civilizations in history - prior to the Spanish conquest in ca. 1500 AD. We will look<br/><br/>at the archaeology - from temples and cities to farmers&#39; homes and fields - to explore<br/><br/>ancient Maya daily lives. We will explore the Maya hieroglyphic writing system<br/><br/>which gives us insight into Maya beliefs, religion, and worldview. Major topics will<br/><br/>include the rise of ancient Maya civilization and the ancient Maya social, economic,<br/><br/>and political systems, subsistence, and religion. The course concludes with an in-<br/><br/>depth study of daily life in the ancient Maya world. We will explore what it was like<br/><br/>to be a Maya farmer living in the small Maya farming community of Chan in Belize,<br/><br/>and discover the lessons of sustainable lifestyles that we can learn from<br/><br/>ancient Maya farmers."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture with power point presentations.
