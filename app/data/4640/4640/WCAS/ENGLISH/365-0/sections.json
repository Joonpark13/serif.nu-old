[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course reads a variety of theoretical and literary texts to examine the interface of postcolonialism, posthumanism, and ecological thought. Using work by such scholars as Byron Caminero-Santangelo, Cajetan Iheka, and Laura Wright, we will particularly critique Western theories of the environment (e.g. Lawrence Buell, Bruno Latour, etc) from a postcolonial perspective as well as read postcolonial texts from ecocritical standpoints, including ecofeminism. We will also examine how at the root of perennial postcolonial debates (e.g., the language debate) is the question of nature. Paying attention to the formal properties the texts use to represent nature, our discussions will include the structural and thematic agency the writers give to other-than-human elements of the cosmos while depicting postcolonial societies' struggle against colonial domination and the over-exploitation of the environment at the hands of global capitalism.", "name": "Studies in Postcolonial Literature", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 122", "topic": "Postcolonial Ecologies", "course": "365-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ENGLISH/365-0/11978", "instructor": ["Evan M Mwangi"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "11978", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
