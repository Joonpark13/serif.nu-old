Whether you hope to become a healthcare provider or not, the medical experience requires a kind of narrative literacy. Both physicians and patients must grapple with narrative expectations (such as notions of causal sequence, symbolism, and closure) when conferring on medical decisions. As a group of future doctors, nurses, caregivers, and patients, we will explore what kinds of stories congregate around Western conceptions of the medical experience. We will approach this task with a multi-disciplinary lens, examining the history of medicine, medical ethics, religious practices, and narrative theory. We will pair contemporary theoretical and non-fiction works on illness with various kinds of narratives designed to communicate a patient's perspective. We will analyze the distinctive opportunities for immersion in stories about illness offered by different genres and media, including personal essays, poetry, films and even a cancer-themed video game. Finally, we will debate the limits of narrative in medical practice?as in communicating the unique cognition of autism, the experience of physical pain, or the process of dying."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar Discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation, one oral presentation, and two papers (one literary close-reading and one argument paper)."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Medical Humanities: An Introduction (2014), Lennard Davis's The End of Normal (2014), Leslie Jamison's The Empathy Exams (2014), Paul Kalanithi When Breath Becomes Air (2015).

Her current book project, The Afterlife of Illness, examines the largely-forgotten history of convalescent caregiving in Victorian Britain in order to theorize a historical reading practice that resisted narrative closure. Professor Krienke has taught courses in both the Feinberg School of Medicine and the Northwestern English Department, where she received a teaching award. In her courses, Professor Krienke aims to foster multi-disciplinary conversations that bridge the structural gap in the university between the humanities and the sciences."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:04 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
