[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The doctor-patient relationship is founded on storytelling. Whether you hope to become a healthcare provider or not, the medical experience requires a kind of narrative literacy. Both physicians and patients must grapple with narrative expectations (such as notions of causal sequence, symbolism, and closure) when conferring on medical decisions. As a group of future doctors, nurses, caregivers, and patients, we will explore what kinds of stories congregate around Western conceptions of the medical experience. We will approach this task with a multi-disciplinary lens, examining the history of medicine, medical ethics, religious practices, and narrative theory. We will pair contemporary theoretical and non-fiction works on illness with various kinds of narratives designed to communicate a patient's perspective. We will analyze the distinctive opportunities for immersion in stories about illness offered by different genres and media, including personal essays, poetry, films and even a cancer-themed video game. Finally, we will debate the limits of narrative in medical practice?as in communicating the unique cognition of autism, the experience of physical pain, or the process of dying.", "name": "Topics in Combined Studies", "section": "20", "location": "Parkes Hall 223", "topic": "", "course": "385-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ENGLISH/385-0/11983", "instructor": ["Hosanna Grace Krienke"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "11983", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
