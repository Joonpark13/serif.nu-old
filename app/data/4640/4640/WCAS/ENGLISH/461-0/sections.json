[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Much recent scholarship on poetry and poetics in the modernist and avant-garde traditions reconsiders modern poetry's cosmopolitan origins, global imagination, international networks, and transcultural diffractions. This scholarship has taken place under headings including \"transnational poetics,\" \"global modernism,\" and \"comparative modernisms.\" This course has several objectives: 1) to read representative works from the significant phases of poetic modernism in English in dialogue with romance language traditions; 2) to survey recent critical approaches to a \"transnational poetics\" of modernism, including hemispheric American studies, diaspora studies, sociology of literature, cultural front internationalism and the post-WWII emergence of postcolonial aesthetics; 3), and most broadly, to assemble an account of how to read the elements of modern poetic form against literary history's cosmopolitan horizons, rather than within the discrete boundaries of national literatures and natural language formations. <br/> <br/>We will not manage a comprehensive survey of any particular national modernism, nor an intensive historical dilation of any one moment in modernist literary production (e.g. an annus mirabilus such as 1913 or 1922). Rather, our focus will be intentionally expansive in both spatial and temporal terms, highlighting comparative problematics with representative texts.", "name": "Studies in Contemporary Literature", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 018 English", "topic": "Mod.
