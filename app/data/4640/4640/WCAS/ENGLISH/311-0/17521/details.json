An exploration of various global poetic traditions, including parts of Africa, Europe, the Arab World, Israel, and the U.S. (including hip-hop), this innovative course will be organized around a series of three-hour seminars and workshops dedicated to the rich and varied practices of poetry, the ways it is taught and learned, and the manner in which it enters and engages diverse communities. As we work through a variety of theoretical, practical, and pedagogical approaches to the different poetic traditions that help create our (un)common world, we will have the opportunity to work with two visiting poets (one from Botswana and one from Chicago), both in class and in the field, as they teach community workshops beyond the walls of the university. We will also benefit from in-class conversations with other poets who will help guide us in our study of the different poetic traditions under investigation and lead us in poetry-writing workshops. From the theoretical study of poetics, to the practice of writing poems, to community engagement at the local level, this class is dedicated to building critical and creative conversations about poetry and poetics, as we explore, interrogate, and begin to understand different poetic traditions."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "TBA."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Attendance in class and participation in outside workshops; 10-page critical paper; portfolio of poems."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "TBA."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "The above course is combined with COMP_LIT 390-0 sec. 20.
