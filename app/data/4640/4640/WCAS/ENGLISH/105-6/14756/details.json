The goal of this seminar is to answer those questions while becoming more enlightened and skillful writers ourselves. Toward that end, we will read narratives of survival and protest by people who have been marginalized by race, gender, poverty, politics, religion, war, or prison. As we do this reading, we will also look at (a) philosophical issues, such as the relationship between stories and &quot;truth&quot; (what's the line between fiction and non-fiction?) and (b) literary issues, such as whether mainstream stories are any different from &quot;stories from the margins.&quot; Then, focusing particularly on narratives related to our country's astonishingly high rate of incarceration, we will examine the power of stories to reshape our understanding of contemporary issues, including marginalization and inclusion at Northwestern.<br/><br/>Papers will involve analysis of personal experience, such as how you have benefited from, or have been challenged by, marginalization, as well as analysis and arguments based on research, exploring whether or how stories from the margin challenge our views of ourselves and the world."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion and workshop,"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Three papers and a short final reflection (approximately 25 pages total, including rough drafts).
