[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will read against the accepted tradition of the American Revolution as an essentially rational, Lockean, and non-terroristic Revolution. We will examine American Revolutionary writing as a rhetorical battlefield in which a multiplicity of voices and a plurality of forms?history, letters, notes, autobiography, novel, lyric, pamphlet, and journalistic piece?struggled over the cultural and political constitution of America and the American. We shall focus in particular on sites of contest, contradiction, resistance, and taboo in Revolutionary writing: the representation of \"citizens\" and \"others\"; conflicts between reason and passion, liberty and slavery, civilization and savage, progress and apocalypse; anxieties about nature, the body, sex, human psychology, race, and madness; the terrors of democracy, mob violence, slave insurrection, and political faction; and debates about the excesses of language, print, and representation. We will also reflect on past and ongoing debates about the meaning of the American Revolution.", "name": "Studies in American Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Parkes Hall 214", "topic": "Founding Terrors", "course": "378-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ENGLISH/378-0/11981", "instructor": ["Betsy J Erkkila"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "11981", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
