While tensions between and relations among African Americans and whites have shaped U.S. history in important ways, this course also recognizes the historical significance of multiple racial and ethnic groups, particularly Asian Americans and Latina/os. We will consider the histories of the various groups alongside one another and U.S. History more generally, as well as intersections among the various groups. Readings include both primary and secondary sources.<br/><br/>We will have four primary objectives in this course: 1) to understand twentieth-century U.S. history through the lens of race; 2) to consider similarities and differences among various racial and ethnic groups' twentieth-century experiences; 3) to foster analytical, reading, discussion, and writing skills that will help students think and communicate critically about historical and contemporary society and politics. 4) to learn to analyze the past using both primary and secondary sources."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:58 PM (CT)", "subject": "AMER_ST"}]
