[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The course surveys the period of Middle Eastern History which witnessed the emergence of Islam, as a religion, political system and cultural tradition. During the Middle Ages (ca. 550-1250 C.E.), Islam united the disparate regions of North Africa and Western Asia and provided the stimulus for unprecedented cultural fluorescence and economic growth, as depicted in the opulence of The Arabian Nights. We shall examine the career of the Prophet Muhammad, who functioned as God's messenger, and subsequently consider the critical social and intellectual issues resulting from the evolution of Muhammad's legacy into a world civilization. The course will terminate with an analysis of the first serious external challenges to this civilization: the Crusades from Western Europe and the Mongol Invasion from Central Asia.", "name": "History of the Islamic Middle East: 600-1200", "section": "1", "location": "University Hall 101", "topic": "", "course": "370-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HISTORY/370-1/12353", "instructor": ["Carl Forbes   Petry"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "12353", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
