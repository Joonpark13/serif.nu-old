It studies the historical emergence and transformation of categories like &quot;indigeneity,&quot; &quot;blackness,&quot; and &quot;whiteness&quot; and how dance practices became associated with these identifications. It also traces dance developments in relation to nation-state formation and social stratification. In short, it explores a paradox: How did dance serve as a source of local cohesion and division by underscoring shared culture as well as racial, gender, and class hierarchies? Weekly readings move forward chronologically from the fifteenth century to present day."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "GRADING BASIS: Student option"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "EVALUATION METHOD: Two response papers, one midterm, and a final"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until order posted to Norris website<br/>READING LIST: Readings (book excerpts and articles) will be made available in a course packet from Quartet Copies"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:05 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
