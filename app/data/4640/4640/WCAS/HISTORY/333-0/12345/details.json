In the wake of these disasters thinkers, artists, and a surprising number of common people began to search for explanations for what had gone wrong by asking questions about their own personal identities, about the obligations of a moral life, about the virtues of civic service, and about the their personal relationship with God. This course explores that search, which is what we now call the Renaissance. It began among the independent city-states of Italy, particularly Florence and Venice, and spread from them to the rest of Europe. The course will compare developments in Italy with those in northern Europe, especially on the political and family structures of the city-states, the culture of the princely courts, the ambitions of the Roman popes, the social and intellectual basis for artistic creativity, the origins of modern political thought and the scientific method, and the constraints and opportunities available to women."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "GRADING BASIS: Student option (P/N allowed)"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "TEACHING METHOD: Lecture and class discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "EVALUATION METHOD: Participation in class discussions, two short papers (ca. 5 pages), and a final paper (10-15 pages)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until order posted on Norris website<br/>Lauro Martines, Power and Imagination: City-States in Renaissance Italy, ISBN: 978-0801836435Giovanni Boccaccio, The Decameron, ISBN: 978-0451531735Benjamin G.
