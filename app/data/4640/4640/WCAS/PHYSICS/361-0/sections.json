[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "We investigate three advanced topics in electricity and magnetism beyond what is covered in Physics 333-1,2.<br/><br/>1) Electromagnetic Radiation - accelerated charges radiate, and this is the basis for communication and<br/>many natural phenomena. Subtle issues linking causality and the space and time domains are important to this topic.<br/><br/>2) Wave Optics - the wave properties of light are responsible for diffraction and interference phenomena.<br/>The basis for these phenomena lies in electro-magnetic theory.<br/><br/>3) Special Relativity - in contrast to mechanics, the laws of electrodynamics are already consistent with<br/>Einstein's theory of special relativity. This theory is explained and related to the electrodynamics in detail.", "name": "Classical Optics and Special Relativity", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute LG68", "topic": "", "course": "361-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PHYSICS/361-0/17441", "instructor": ["Enectali   Figueroa-Feliciano"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "17441", "subject": "PHYSICS"}]
