[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "An accelerated one quarter course in organic chemistry (without laboratory) intended for graduate students in chemistry and related fields needing a working knowledge of the principles of organic chemistry. <br/><br/>Topics include structure and reactions of organic molecules and an introduction to the strategy of organic synthesis. These topics approximately parallel those covered in Chemistry 212-1,2. This course may also be appropriate for graduate students or advanced undergraduates in other fields of science and engineering having little or no prior course work in organic chemistry. <br/><br/>This course is not appropriate for Northwestern undergraduates who have completed Chemistry 210-1,2 or 212-1,2.
