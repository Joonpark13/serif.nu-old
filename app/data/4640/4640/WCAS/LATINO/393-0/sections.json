[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "There is a current notion of ?woke Latinxs' in activism and social media. How do some Latinxs become \"woke\"? Why doesn't this happen more? What are the many ways in which Latinxs might be woke? This course looks at the ranges of possibilities and practices of being woke within Chicana/ Latina feminisms, including earlier practices concienciaci\u00f3n/ consciousness raising and articulations of the power of la mujer. We will use qualitative methodology to look at the current practices of self-representation in interviews, social media, and other forms of representation. The course considers the conditions that encourage ?sleeping/ sleepwalking' and the cost of responding to those conditions. By asking, \"What are Chicanxs and Latinxs saying about this moment of realization?\" and \"How are the saying it?\" students consider what are we becoming woke to and awoken from? What does that expansive range mean? What are the historical antecedents? Students will have an opportunity to create or produce their own vision of being woke.", "name": "Topics in Latina and Latino Text and Representation", "section": "1", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-415", "topic": "", "course": "393-0", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/LATINO/393-0/13147", "instructor": ["Monica L Russel y Rodriguez"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "13147", "subject": "LATINO"}]
