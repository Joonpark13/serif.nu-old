[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a combination of (usually) linear techniques to combine measurement (latent variable) models with path (regression) analysis. Special cases of SEM are classic reliability theory, confirmatory factor analysis, path analysis and regression analysis. This course will address the basic theory behind SEM and work through examples using standard sem computer programs (e.g.,the sem package in R, Mx, LISREL, EQS, AMOS).", "name": "Psychological Measurement", "section": "20", "location": "Swift Hall 210", "topic": "", "course": "454-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 4:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PSYCH/454-0/10205", "instructor": ["William R Revelle"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "10205", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
