However, within these societies, individuals, groups, and corporations often encounter a wide variety of opportunities and temptations to pursue their own personal goals, aspirations and achievements at the expense of the larger social good. What then determines when people will resist versus give into these temptations? Where do people's concerns for others come from in the first place, and what types of experiences nurture versus suppress these concerns? In this course we will explore these questions by reviewing the decades of research on prosocial behavior performed by economists, evolutionary biologists, and social psychologists. Through the reading of primary-source articles, class discussions, and hands-on class exercises and demonstrations we will uncover the fundamental psychological mechanisms responsible for behaviors such as fairness, trust, reciprocity, cooperation, helping, and altruism. Evaluations will be based on preparation of discussion questions, class participation and several written assignments."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: Psychology 205"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "There will not be a textbook for the course.
