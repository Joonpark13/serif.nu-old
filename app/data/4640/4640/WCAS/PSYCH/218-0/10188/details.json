The course considers perspectives and methods in developmental research. As each new topic is introduced, students are encouraged to think critically about the assumptions and methods that underlie research on particular issues. A central goal is to help students develop an appreciation of different criteria for evaluating research and other forms of evidence. The discussion sections will allow students to consider how the theoretical and research findings are relevant in specific domains, and will generally focus on more applied issues."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Must be incoming First-Year with AP Psychology credit"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and discussion sections"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Weekly written discussion questions and two exams"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Siegler, R., DeLoache, J., &amp; Eisenberg, N.
