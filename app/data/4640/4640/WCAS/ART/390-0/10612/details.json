Art as Vandalism asks its participants to take vandalism seriously and put it to use through interventions in public space and destructive acts that lead to ungoverned outcomes. Through the realization of projects in relation to reading and discussion, we will explore the ways in which disruption and destruction can lead to transformation. We will spend time with authors such as Badiou and Agamben, artists including Daniel Buren, Art and Language, Martha Rosler and Daniil Kharms, and the manifestos of Ted Kaczinski (a.k.a. the unibomber) and Steven Shearer, who wrote &quot;APOCALYPTIC HARVEST, PESTILENT FUNERAL FOGS, WHISPERS OF SUFFERING, ANCESTRAL NECROSODOMY, FECULENT BLACK EARTH, RELENTLESS SLAUGHTER, ENIGMATICAL HUMAN HATRED, SPHERE OF ROTTING, FLOURESCENT BLEEDING CHAOS, FOUL WINDS OF PUTREFACTION, ETERNAL DISMEMBERMENT, CADAVERIC MANSTRUBATION, CENTURIES IN DECOMPOSITION DESTROY SACRED WORDS. &quot;<br/><br/>This course has no prerequisites and is open to both undergraduate and graduate students."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "This course has no prerequisites and is open to both undergraduate and graduate students."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:58 PM (CT)", "subject": "ART"}]
