[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, we will examine two of the greatest works of world literature, The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky, and Anna Karenina by Tolstoy, in depth. These two novels raise profound questions and offer challenging answers to the most important issues of life: What gives life meaning, how to understand evil, the nature and kinds of love, the significance of death, faith and despair, how to make ourselves and the world around us better, and the way human minds work. We will see why Tolstoy and Dostoevsky are often considered the greatest psychologists who ever lived and why Russian literature conveys a sense of urgency perhaps unmatched anywhere else in human culture. Students will also learn skills for understanding novels that will make it easier and more rewarding to read great fiction generally.", "name": "Introduction to Russian Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Leverone Auditorium Owen Coon", "topic": "", "course": "210-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/SLAVIC/210-2/14338", "instructor": ["Gary S Morson"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>Given in English<br/><br/>", "id": "14338", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
