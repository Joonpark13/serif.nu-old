[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "LEGAL ST 101-6-20, First Year Seminar: \"Law and the Civil Rights Movement\" <br/>Prof. Joanna Grisinger, Fall 2016<br/><br/>This course explores the relationship between law and civil rights - in particular, African-Americans' efforts to secure legal, political, civil, and economic rights. How and why did the American civil rights movement pursue legal change through the judicial, legislative, and executive branch? How and why did legal actors (including judges, White House officials, members of Congress, and state governors) engage with civil rights reformers? What are the benefits of pursuing legal change, and what are the limits? In order to answer such questions, we will read and discuss material including court cases, statutes, speeches, memoirs, newspaper articles, photographs, and songs.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 318", "topic": "Law and the Civil Rights Movem", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/LEGAL_ST/101-6/13173", "instructor": ["Joanna Lynn Grisinger"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "13173", "subject": "LEGAL_ST"}]
