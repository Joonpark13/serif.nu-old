While tensions between and relations among African Americans and whites have shaped U.S. history in important ways, this course also recognizes the historical significance of multiple racial and ethnic groups, particularly Asian Americans and Latinos. We will consider the histories of the various groups alongside one another and U.S. History more generally, as well as intersections among the various groups, and will consider how law shapes (and is shaped by) the racial and ethnic categories in question. <br/>Students will write two short primary source analysis papers (3-5 pages) and one 6-8 page research proposal.", "name": "Comparative Race & Ethnicity", "section": "20", "location": "Fisk Hall 114", "topic": "", "course": "347-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/LEGAL_ST/347-0/13175", "instructor": ["Shana B Bernstein"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "13175", "subject": "LEGAL_ST"}]
