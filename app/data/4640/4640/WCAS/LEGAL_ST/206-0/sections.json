[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Legal_St 206 \"Law and Society\", Also taught with SOCIOL 206<br/>Prof. Laura Beth Nielsen, Fall 2016<br/><br/>Law is everywhere. Law permits, prohibits, enables, legitimates, protects, and prosecutes citizens. Law shapes our day to day lives in countless ways. This course examines the connections and relationships of law and society using an interdisciplinary social science approach. As one of the founders of the Law and Society movement observed, \"law is too important to leave to lawyers.\" Accordingly, this course will borrow from several theoretical, disciplinary, and interdisciplinary perspectives (such as sociology, anthropology, political science, critical studies, psychology) in order to explore the sociology of law and law's role primarily in the American context (but with some attention to international law and global human rights efforts). The thematic topics to be discussed include law and social control; law's role in social change; as well as law's capacity to reach into complex social relations and intervene in existing normative institutions, organizational structures, and the like.", "name": "Law and Society", "section": "20", "location": "Leverone Auditorium Owen Coon", "topic": "", "course": "206-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/LEGAL_ST/206-0/13166", "instructor": ["Laura B Nielsen"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "13166", "subject": "LEGAL_ST"}]
