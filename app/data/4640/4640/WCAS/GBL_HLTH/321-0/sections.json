[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course draws on perspectives from anthropology and related social scientific fields to provide a comparative overview of the impact of armed conflict on public health and health care systems worldwide. Drawing primarily on examples from recent history, including conflicts in the Balkans, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East, we will explore warfare as a crucial sociopolitical determinant of global health disparities and consider organized efforts to respond to the health impacts of mass violence. Key topics that we will consider include variations in the relationship between warfare and public health across eras and cultures; the health and mental health impacts of forced displacement, military violence, and gender-based violence; and the roles of medical humanitarianism and humanitarian psychiatry in postwar recovery processes. Through close readings of classic and contemporary social theory, ethnographic accounts, and diverse research on war, health, and postwar humanitarian interventions, this course will encourage you to build your own critical perspective on war and public health anchored in history and the complexities of real-world situations.", "name": "War and Public Health", "section": "1", "location": "University Hall 412", "topic": "", "course": "321-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 1:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/GBL_HLTH/321-0/17536", "instructor": ["Peter Andrew Locke"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>No Freshmen<br/><br/>", "id": "17536", "subject": "GBL_HLTH"}]
