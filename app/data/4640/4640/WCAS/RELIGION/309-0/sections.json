[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Indian Secularism and Religious Nationalism.<br/><ln/><br/>In light of the recent ascent to power of the BJP in India, this course will ask one fundamental question: how can India be both officially secular and governed by Hindu Nationalists? Beginning with a discussion of the history and unique form of Indian secularism, the course will then investigate secularism's impact on legal matters in India. Next the course will examine Hindu nationalism's history and ideology, and the role of religious nationalism in major events. Finally, the course will engage with recent scholarship on secularism in India that present various differing viewpoints that will problematize any straightforward answer to the course's fundamental question, and will even challenge the presuppositions of the question itself. Our conversation and debate will be open to all variety of opinions. Comparisons with secularism and religious nationalism in other countries will also be encouraged.", "name": "Topics in Hinduism", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-410", "topic": "Indian Secularism and Religious Nationalism", "course": "309-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/RELIGION/309-0/14157", "instructor": ["Charles Scott Preston"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "14157", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
