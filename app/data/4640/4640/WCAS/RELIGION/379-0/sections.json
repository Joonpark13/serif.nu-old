[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Using a multi-disciplinary approach, this seminar-style course investigates the construct of <br/>\"religion\" in the contemporary American context and examines the ways in which religious systems and beliefs intersect with other primary identity categories and group memberships. We will work through the social construction and experience of religion(s) for both the group and the individual. Particular thought will be given to <i>whose</i> \"group\" and <i>whose</i> \"religion\" is at work shaping experience. Many social scientific studies of religion tend to focus on mapping out and making sense of practices, patterns of affiliation, etc. We will instead examine how \"religion\" and religious ideas are manifest in everyday lives and experiences, even for those who are unaffiliated or understand themselves as non-religious. By looking at how religions and religious beliefs interact with a variety of other types of individual and collective identities and discourses such as ethnicity, race, gender, and American-ness, and in turn, how each of these shapes the American cultural landscape <i>writ large</i>, we will aim to gain insight into the importance and role of religion in contemporary American life and in the lives of Americans. <br/><br/><ln/>We will start by examining a number of theories of \"religion\" in order to best understand what it is/isn't and how it is/isn't differentiated from other types of beliefs (such as political ideology, \"culture,\" and so on). We will also work towards developing an understanding of the dominant cultural narrative(s) in the mainstream American context and examine the role that \"religion\" historically and in the contemporary context plays in shaping those narratives so as to be able to make sense of the ways in which these narratives affect the ways in which groups construct and experience their own identities and realities and \"others\" various groups. The remainder of the course will work through a series of case studies, looking at how religion is manifested in, for example, class, race, ethnicity, gender, and place, as well as how each of these categories is in turn constitutive of religious identity and/or group membership in the contemporary American context. The course will illustrate that religious discourses are prolific and have profound impact in individual and group lives. Further, we will see that \"religion\" is not a static construct, but instead is perpetually evolving, affecting individual identities and experience, and both local/group specific and larger cultural and national narratives.", "name": "Topics in Comparative Religion", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G32", "topic": "Religion and Identity", "course": "379-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/RELIGION/379-0/14860", "instructor": ["Lilah Devra Shapiro"], "class_attributes": "No Freshmen<br/><br/>", "id": "14860", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
