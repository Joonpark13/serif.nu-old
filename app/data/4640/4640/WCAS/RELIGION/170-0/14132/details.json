Students should gain a basic &quot;literacy&quot; in each of these traditions; (2) It will encourage students to become comfortable thinking analytically about religion. The course will discuss how various scholars have understood what religion &quot;is,&quot; and explore several lenses through which they analyze it (mythology; ritual, worship and sacred space; prayer and meditation; morality, ethics, and politics; and gender and sexuality); (3) Students will apply their religious literacy, along with their newfound analytic skills to identify similarities, but also differences between and among religious traditions."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "The course will consist of an in-class midterm and an in-class final."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "course pack"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:09 PM (CT)", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
