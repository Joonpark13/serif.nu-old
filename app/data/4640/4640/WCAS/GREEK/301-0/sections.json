[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Odysseus' homecoming to Ithaca is one of the most fascinating and enduring narratives of Western culture. While Nausicaa, the Cyclops, and the Sirens irresistibly appeal to our imagination, Odysseus' wanderings, return, and revenge raise fundamental questions about identity, gender, and justice. We will read three books in the original Greek from different sections of the poem and reflect upon the complex relationship between Odysseus' travels through supernatural lands and his subsequent adventures on Ithaka. We will also read the entire poem in English and discuss a selection of articles emphasizing the poetic, anthropological, and cultural significance of the Odyssey in its ancient performance context.", "name": "Readings in Greek Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge 4364 Classics Sem Rm", "topic": "Homer's Odyssey", "course": "301-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/GREEK/301-0/10962", "instructor": ["Marianne I Hopman"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "10962", "subject": "GREEK"}]
