Whereas the former will<br/>make you a better colleague to fellow social scientists, the latter improves your job<br/>prospects (and get you colleagues to begin with). Based on the potential outcomes<br/>framework, this class will introduce students to qualitative and quantitative techniques<br/>that enable researchers to isolate causal effects. It will force students to move beyond<br/>&quot;naive&quot; regression and case study designs and explore how &quot;less na\u00efve&quot; combinations of<br/>both methods can strengthen our confidence in causal claims. It does this by<br/>emphasizing the importance of research design and making explicit the assumptions<br/>underlying causal arguments."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "This course will have required books/other materials.<br/><br/>Thad Dunning (2012) Natural Experiments in the Social Sciences: A design based<br/>Approach.
