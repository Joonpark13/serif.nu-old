[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this class, we will investigate how gender - as a set of relations, identities and cultural schemas - shapes politics, including political participation and representation, the formation of social movements (e.g., the feminist and anti-ERA movements), and social policy, as well as how, in turn, political institutions and policy shape gender. We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both \"top down\" and \"bottom up\" perspectives. And we will take advantage of the fact that we are in the middle of a Presidential election to examine gendered politics in the contemporary United States.", "name": "Sociology of Gender", "section": "20", "location": "SOCIOL Sem Rm 107 - 1812 Chi", "topic": "", "course": "356-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/SOCIOL/356-0/17786", "instructor": ["Ann Shola   Orloff"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "17786", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
