Or is it an inevitable by-product of human society? Can technology and political will ever make possible a post-scarcity society? What are the conditions that produce, distribute, and mediate scarcity locally, nationally and globally? How does scarcity interact with abundance? What are the cultural and historical effects of scarcity? When and to whom is scarcity invisible? Which policies work best in confronting scarcity? These are some of the questions that will animate this class as we examine scarcity in the distribution of water, food and healthcare in countries and communities around the world. Topics include: the effects of gender, race, ethnicity on scarcity; what the developed world can learn from the developing world about conservation and distribution; how scarcity is portrayed or ignored in contemporary media."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "lecture, discussion, student presentations"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "short paper, midterm and final, participation"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Please contact instructor for a list of books."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:10 PM (CT)", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
