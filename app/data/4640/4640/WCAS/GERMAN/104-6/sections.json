[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Friedrich Nietzsche's famous characterization of German 19th century art and science as a crass fetish-being introduces the notion of the fetish into the vocabulary of cultural analysis. Since its origin in the ethnographic writings of the enlightenment in the 17th and 18th century, the fetish appears in many different incarnations in such heterogeneous discourses as theology, Marxism, sociology, psychoanalysis, the clinical psychiatry of sexual deviance, modernist aesthetics, popular culture, and anthropology. This class will give a historical survey of these transformations by focusing on crucial representations of the fetish, fetishism and the fetishist in literature (Sacher-Masoch, Hoffmann), philosophy (Marx, Adorno, Benjamin), psychoanalysis (Freud) and film (Lynch, Cronenberg, Farocki).", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge 3354 German Seminar Rm.", "topic": "Secret Life of the Fetish", "course": "104-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 9:00AM - 9:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/GERMAN/104-6/12254", "instructor": ["Jorg   Kreienbrock"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>", "id": "12254", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
