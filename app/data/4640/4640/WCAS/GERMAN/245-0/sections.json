[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Everybody who has been to Germany knows that Germans are obsessed with crime stories: \"Tatort\", the weekly TV series that has 20 teams of investigators solve crimes all over the country, is widely seen as a symbol for the federal republic with all its strengths and weaknesses, and the bestseller lists are brimming over with detective stories of all kind. We will definitely watch some \"Tatort\" and read some contemporary crime fiction, but we will also try to gain some historical insight: From Friedrich Schiller`s \"Verbrecher aus verlorener Ehre\" (Criminal of Lost Honor) to GDR movies concerned with a crimeless socialist society, from Theodor Fontane`s realist novella \"Unterm Birnbaum\" (Under the Pear Tree) to classics of cinematic history like Fritz Lang`s \"M\", artists have again and again revisited tropes of crime, punishment, guilt and social reintegration.
