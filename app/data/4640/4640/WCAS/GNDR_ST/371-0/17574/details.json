We will touch on topics as diverse as prostitution, pornography, and other aspects of the sex industry; medical technologies such as birth control, gender reassignment, and aesthetic surgery; and historic shifts in social categories that we commonly attribute to an unchanging biology of race, sex, disability, and health. Our goal is to understand &quot;body history&quot; in a way that not only illuminates the past but also interrogates the received wisdom that governs how we live our lives. Readings include cultural theory and fiction, as well as scholarship in history , anthropology , sociology , and gender studies. The course is also designed to expose students to the tools and techniques of historical research and writing."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 7:05 PM (CT)", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}]
