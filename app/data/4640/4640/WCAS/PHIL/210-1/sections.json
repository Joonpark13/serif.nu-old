[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will be taught by visiting professor Christopher Shields of the University of Notre Dame. (https://philosophy.nd.edu/people/faculty/christopher-shields/) <br/><br/>Socrates poses a series of deceptively simple questions: What is justice? What is holiness? What is virtue? Strikingly, he contends that he is unable to answer these questions himself?and seems adept at showing that those who think they know the answers in fact do not. Using his elenchtic method (the ?Socratic method'), he is able to reduce his interlocutors to embarrassing perplexity and outright contradiction. One question from Socrates, then: do you think you can answer such questions? Plato and Aristotle, who followed in his wake in the rich philosophical milieu of ancient Athens, seem to think that they can develop the epistemological and metaphysical sophistication required to answer them satisfactorily. So, a second question from Socrates: are they right?", "name": "History of Philosophy - Ancient", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall 107", "topic": "", "course": "210-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/PHIL/210-1/13757", "instructor": ["Christopher John Shields"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "13757", "subject": "PHIL"}]
