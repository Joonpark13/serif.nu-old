[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The 20th century has been marked by upheaval and consequent migration for the people of the Korean peninsula. As a result of these migrations, substantial communities of ethnic Koreans exist in Central Asia, China, Japan, the United States and Canada, South America and Europe. How and why did Koreans go to these places? What kinds of communities and identities did they construct? How do these Koreans fit into the history of Korea, particularly in the context of a country divided into two opposing states? How do they fit into the history of their host countries? By examining the histories of ethnic Koreans outside the Korean peninsula, we will examine issues of migration, diaspora, race relations, and colonialism. We will also take a fresh look at modern Korean history by examining how these \"overseas Koreans\" view and relate to the history and ongoing politics of their divided homeland.", "name": "Studies in Diaspora", "section": "1", "location": "Frances Searle Building 3220", "topic": "Korean Diasporas", "course": "370-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ASIAN_AM/370-0/10624", "instructor": ["Ji-Yeon   Yuh"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "10624", "subject": "ASIAN_AM"}]
