[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Asian American Studies, as a part of Ethnic Studies, emerged from the interracial social movements and global solidarities of the 1960s and 1970s, and sought to value the histories, experiences, communities, and people who had been excluded from classrooms and curriculum. In this course, we will focus on the experiences of Asian and Asian American people from the 19th to the 21st centuries through an interdisciplinary lens. Our week-to-week explorations will ask key questions that characterize Asian American scholarship and activism, paying attention to intersections of identity and difference, as well as interracial and intraracial conflict and cooperation. What can we learn about race, rights, national metanarrative, agency, imperialism, capital, and diversity by centralizing Asian Americans?", "name": "Introduction to Asian American Studies", "section": "1", "location": "555 Clark B03", "topic": "", "course": "210-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/ASIAN_AM/210-0/10625", "instructor": ["Douglas Sadao Ishii"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "10625", "subject": "ASIAN_AM"}]
