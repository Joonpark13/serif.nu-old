[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course surveys Japanese cinema from its earliest days to the contemporary moment. We will consider how film and other moving image technologies have reflected historical periods and shaped cultural discourses in modern Japan. Focusing on films that raise disciplinary questions related to the cinematic medium and Japan, we will examine, among other topics, the relationship between nationhood and the formation of a \"national\" cinema; genre theory and melodrama; J-horror and digital media. We will also study the place of important individual directors - Ozu, Mizoguchi, and Kurosawa - within the broader economic and institutional contexts of Japanese cinema and its global circulation.", "name": "World Cinemas", "section": "20", "location": "555 Clark B01", "topic": "Cinema Japan", "course": "305-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/COMP_LIT/305-0/14243", "instructor": ["Patrick James Noonan"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "14243", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
