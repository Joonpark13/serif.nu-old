[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Reading World Literature: \"Self\" Creation & First Person Narration<br/>Beyond the grammatical, what is meant by the \"first person\"? Some answers might include a literary technique, a claim to identity, and a perspective on the world. Yet no matter how clear its vision, the story of an \"I\" also unfolds as a dark mystery, one that is never fully solved. From childhood on, how does the \"I,\" with its own secret desires and ulterior motives, absorb or transfigure the environments that surround it ? its cultural, political, and physical geographies? How are the notions of reliability or self-knowledge anchored or imperiled by the mysteries, inventions, and confessions of first-person story-telling (especially as it draws on philosophy and poetry)? This course gives students concrete tools for reflecting on first person aesthetics, while always returning to larger questions about how the problem of perspective helps create or alienate a \"self,\" in the struggle to solve the mystery (or even the crime) of identity.", "name": "Reading World Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Fisk Hall 114", "topic": "", "course": "201-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/COMP_LIT/201-0/14239", "instructor": ["Tristram Nash Wolff"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "14239", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
