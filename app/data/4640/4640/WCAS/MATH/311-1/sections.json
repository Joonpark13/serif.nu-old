[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Probability and Stochastic Processes is three-quarter sequence in probability and stochastic processes requiring background in calculus but not measure theory. The first quarter is a careful introduction to probability spaces, random variables, independence, distributions, and generating functions culminating in the Central Limit Theorem. The second and third quarters largely concern stochastic processes, including Markov chains, stationary processes, martingales, and diffusion processes.
