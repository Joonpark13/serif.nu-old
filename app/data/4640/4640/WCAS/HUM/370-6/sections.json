[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course surveys the field of what is variously referred to as \"new media\" or \"digital art.\" It considers Western art and artistic practices employing digital computational technologies from the room-sized mainframe computer to today's mobile and ubiquitous media, roughly from the 1960s to the present. We will attend to the work of a variety of artists working in a host of emergent genres (net.art, glitch art, interactive art, bio art, etc.) in order to gauge the ways in which digital media has changed, continues to change, and has failed to change contemporary art, culture, and experience more broadly. Possible topics include new media art's vexed relation to the art world, networks and networked sociality; sexuality and digital art; and the changing meanings of abstraction and figuration. The course will include a visit to the Block Museum to view their collection of computer-generated prints. Artists to be studied may include Frances Stark, Cory Arcangel, Jason Salavon, Lillian Schwartz, Paul Chan, Jon Satrom, Lynn Hershman Leeson, Vuk Cosic, and others.", "name": "Special Topics in the Humanities", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-430", "topic": "New Media Art", "course": "370-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/WCAS/HUM/370-6/12940", "instructor": ["James Joseph Hodge"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "12940", "subject": "HUM"}]
