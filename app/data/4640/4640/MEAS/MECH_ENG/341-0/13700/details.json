The course will promote project-based learning which encourages students to work on computational design projects. The course will also expose students to the state-of-the art commercial software for computational design.<br/><br/>Topics include:<br/>Engineering systems and modeling<br/>Simulation in design <br/>Optimization<br/>Sampling and analysis of physical and computer experiments<br/>Probabilistic computing/robust design<br/>Finite element based structural optimization"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Senior standing or consent of instructor."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Homework (40%), Mid term (15%), Project (25%written + 10% presentation), Class participation (10%)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Introduction to Optimum Design, 4th edition, Jasbir Arora, Elsevier, 2016, ISBN 978-0128008065"}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "MECH_ENG"}]
