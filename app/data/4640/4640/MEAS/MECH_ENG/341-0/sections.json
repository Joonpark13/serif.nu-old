[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "The course is designed to provide students across all engineering disciplines a view of using computational techniques and the simulation-based design paradigm for engineering decision making, across a wide spectrum of activities in engineering product development, including those in product design, manufacturing, and life cycle engineering. The course will promote project-based learning which encourages students to work on computational design projects. The course will also expose students to the state-of-the art commercial software for computational design.<br/><br/>Topics include:<br/>Engineering systems and modeling<br/>Simulation in design <br/>Optimization<br/>Sampling and analysis of physical and computer experiments<br/>Probabilistic computing/robust design<br/>Finite element based structural optimization", "name": "Computational Methods for Engineering Design", "section": "1", "location": "Frances Searle Building 2107", "topic": "", "course": "341-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MEAS/MECH_ENG/341-0/13700", "instructor": ["Wei   Chen"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "13700", "subject": "MECH_ENG"}]
