Want to be a user of such tools and/or gain the ability to write your own codes? Then, this course is for you.<br/><br/>Computational fluid dynamics is an important tool to investigate fluid flow problems in industry and academia. This first course in the series can be taken without prior background in computational techniques. A background of fundamental fluid dynamics, partial differential equations, linear algebra and a programming language is desirable. The primary focus in this first course is to gain a solid foundation of numerical methods for convection-diffusion problems. The emphasis is on the physical meaning underlying the required mathematics. A control volume method, which is a robust physically intuitive numerical approach, widely used in industry and academia alike, is taught."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Who takes it: Undergraduate and graduate students interested in computational methods for fluid flow problems."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "value": "Suhas V.
