[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "<br/>Have you ever wondered how a bug looks when magnified 10,000 times? How about 100,000 times? How about a music CD or a Pentium chip? Well...this course is all about \"structure\" of all types of materials, from metals to semiconductors to biological materials. This is a laboratory oriented course and is designed to teach materials science and engineering using scanning electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. First, principles of SEM and STM are taught in class, and the training in using these two types of microscopes is provided in the laboratory. Second, students carry out projects of their design on structure and properties of materials using SEM. Third, reporting of the project results via and oral presentation and a written report is required at the end of the quarter.", "name": "MS & E Freshman Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute LG68", "topic": "", "course": "190-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/MEAS/MAT_SCI/190-0/13236", "instructor": ["Vinayak P Dravid"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "13236", "subject": "MAT_SCI"}]
