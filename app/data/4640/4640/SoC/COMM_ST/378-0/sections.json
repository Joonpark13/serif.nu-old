[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Online communities and crowds are among the most innovative organizations today. Distributed groups collaborate over the Internet to write free encyclopedias, launch social movements, create software, share music and films, develop new products, and conduct advanced scientific research. When and why do these efforts succeed? What motivates participants to join, contribute, and sustain these communities? How can online communities' and crowds' successes be harnessed and reproduced? What can be learned from their shortcomings? This course presents an intensive and interdisciplinary introduction to the study of online communities and crowds, with a particular emphasis on how and why some of these systems mobilize and organize people in ways that seem to have been impossible a few decades ago. Throughout the quarter, we will analyze these and other conceptual puzzles, studying many different communities in the process. Readings and assignments will draw on current research in the social sciences (Communication, Sociology, Economics) and Human Computer Interaction.", "name": "Online Communities and Crowds", "section": "20", "location": "Frances Searle Building 2107", "topic": "", "course": "378-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM", "Fr 2:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SoC/COMM_ST/378-0/16216", "instructor": ["Aaron David Shaw"], "class_attributes": "No Freshmen<br/><br/>", "id": "16216", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
