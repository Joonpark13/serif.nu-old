Or it can be used to cement power and subject the masses to tyranny. Theater can spread information during famine, health crises, and war. It can throw elections. It has been used for hundreds of years to change society. This course will bring together theater makers and students who will study those artists working at the intersection of theater, politics and social justice. Relevant areas of interest will include workers rights, anti-war protest, civil rights, HIV/AIDS, queer theater, gender-based violence and how theater is used in electoral politics and political movements throughout history. The course will have a special focus on Augusto Boal's Theater of the Oppressed and other contemporary performance work."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:51 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
