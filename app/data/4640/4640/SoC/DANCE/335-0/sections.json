[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course examines the histories of Latin American dances and their relationship to developing notions of race and nation in the region. It studies the historical emergence and transformation of categories like \"indigeneity,\" \"blackness,\" and \"whiteness\" and how dance practices became associated with these identifications. It also traces dance developments in relation to nation-state formation and social stratification. In short, it explores a paradox: How did dance serve as a source of local cohesion and division by underscoring shared culture as well as racial, gender, and class hierarchies? Weekly readings move forward chronologically from the fifteenth century to present day.", "name": "Special Topics in Dance Research", "section": "20", "location": "University Library Video Theat", "topic": "Dance, Race & Nation in Latin America", "course": "335-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4640/SoC/DANCE/335-0/11188", "instructor": ["Elizabeth Bowlsby Schwall"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "11188", "subject": "DANCE"}]
