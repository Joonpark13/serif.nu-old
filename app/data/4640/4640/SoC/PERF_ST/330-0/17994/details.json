When a text was not originally intended for the stage, how do we make the audience see what the text allows a reader to see? What are the tricks of the trade and what new theatrical tricks might we invent? How do we develop images that are complex, apt and striking? Assignments will draw from both dramatic and non-dramatic texts and may include such exercises as staging the same literary event in multiple ways, staging the &quot;epic&quot; event, handling narrative and internal thought, compression of text, etc."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:50 PM (CT)", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
