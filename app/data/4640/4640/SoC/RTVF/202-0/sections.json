We will consider the tension revealed in films which present varying perspectives on print, broadcast, and internet media operations. Are the media operating for the common good or ill, to reveal or to hide corruption in business and government, and/or to raise the level of public discourse or pander to the uninformed masses? Especially in this election year, what sources of news do you trust to give you accurate information, and which are manipulating facts to further an agenda or merely to entertain? We will use these films to generate lively class discussions and rich paper topics. <br/><br/>Registration requirements: First years only, priority to RTVF majors<br/><br/>Learning objectives: Acquiring/fine tuning skills in writing college-level analytical and research papers while exploring topics relevant to both historic and current media culture.<br/><br/>Evaluation method: Class participation, in-class writing exercises, 3 papers of varying lengths (done in drafts, one-on-one paper conferences, and revised). No final exam.<br/><br/>Required text: Hacker, Diana, and Nancy Sommers. A Pocket Style Manual, Seventh Edition. New York: Bedford/St. Martin's Press, 2015.
