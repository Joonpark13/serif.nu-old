The course will focus on understanding the relationship between screens, the spaces around screens, and human performance. The course is a practical survey of systems that create meaning by engendering human interaction and participation. Students are encouraged to use a range of creative media to initiate playful situations that span different disciplines and dimensions of art-making. Units are constructed around questions of what contexts are suitable for the combination of live performance and media, how one might approach different audiences, and how one constructs a system that negotiates order with unexpected results. Students will have the opportunity to conceptualize their own projects and select from a menu of approaches in order to resolve them. Students will be evaluated through active participation, individual exercises, reading responses, presentations, and unit projects in group critique. The course is designed for students of any experience level.<br/><br/>Learning Outcomes:<br/>By the end of the quarter students should have a strong understanding of contemporary developments in media-enabled performance. Students should also have a working understanding of different tools for performing with media and technology as an individual production practice. Students should also be able to discern what tool and approach is appropriate and effective for a given concept, as well as how to seek out additional resources on their own.<br/><br/>Materials:<br/>Readings will be provided as pdf or web documents."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:50 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
