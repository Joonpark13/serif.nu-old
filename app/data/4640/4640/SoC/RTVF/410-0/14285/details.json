We explore historical models through which to understand the significance of media (mostly film and television, but also new digital platforms) in the everyday life of 20th and 21st Century publics. We will consider the relationship among texts, audiences, and historical contexts, and access various models of cultural history and media history. We will also ask questions about media, the archive, and memory. We'll examine how popular memories of the past invade all sorts of modern/postmodern cultural experiences from the tourist trip to the public museum to ephemera collections to digital archives. Finally, we'll consider how memory can serve as a source of alternative historical knowledge."}], "lmod": "10/30/16 6:50 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
