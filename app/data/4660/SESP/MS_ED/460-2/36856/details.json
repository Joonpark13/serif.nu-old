We will achieve this in two ways: (1) by implementing, reflecting upon, and redesigning a leadership routine (&quot;action-observation-reflection&quot;) to accomplish established goals at teachers&#8217; school sites, and (2) by examining various aspects of leadership that can facilitate teachers&#8217; personal leadership practice and development."}], "lmod": "2/19/17 6:42 PM (CT)", "subject": "MS_ED"}]
