The focus is on integrating across theoretical frameworks in order to maximize classroom support and minimize the need for individual differentiation for students struggling with physical, academic or emotional challenges, including learning disabilities, emotional disturbance, attention deficit disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. Theoretical concepts are introduced in both readings and lecture. Teamwork exercises designed to promote research and theory-based practice provide students with opportunities to analyze increasingly complex case studies, while developing skills in educational leadership, collegial collaboration and student advocacy.
