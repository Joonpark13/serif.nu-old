Topics will include analyzing two- and three-dimensional space and figures using distance, angle, similarity, and congruence; informal geometric constructions; right triangles and trigonometry; circles; understanding and applying the Pythagorean Theorem; and coordinate geometry with algebraic representations. Emphases will be placed on geometric reasoning, proof, and modeling. The course will utilize dynamic geometry software as a tool to investigate and model geometric phenomena.", "name": "Topics in Teaching and Learning", "section": "21", "location": "Annenberg Hall 345", "topic": "Geometry", "course": "451-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:00PM - 9:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SESP/MS_ED/451-0/36842", "instructor": ["James J Lynn"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "36842", "subject": "MS_ED"}]
