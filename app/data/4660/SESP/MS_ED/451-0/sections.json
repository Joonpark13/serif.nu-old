Emphases will be placed on geometric reasoning, proof, and modeling. The course will utilize dynamic geometry software as a tool to investigate and model geometric phenomena.", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Topics in Teaching and Learning", "title": "SESP MS_ED 451-0-21 Topics in Teaching and Learning", "lmod": "2/22/17 6:40 PM (CT)", "section": "21", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "James J Lynn", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "Geometry", "course": "451-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "The course is intended to deepen conceptual understanding of middle school and high school geometry topics, especially as related to attributes and relationships of geometric objects.
