Teachers must communicate with students and foster an environment in which students can communicate with each other. Teachers must not only be comfortable themselves with public speaking; if a teacher wishes to assign oral presentations to his or her students, it is imperative that the teacher be able to assist those students as well. Teacher candidates in the class will be expected to make several small presentations, both to highlight different styles of public speaking, and also to simply grow comfortable speaking in front of others. Interpersonal communication, social emotional learning, and classroom management issues will be discussed. This class will satisfy the public speaking deficiency for licensure and will also count as a graduate-level elective for the Master of Science in Education degree."}], "lmod": "2/12/17 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "MS_ED"}]
