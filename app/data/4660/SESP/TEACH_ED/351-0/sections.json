[{"school": "SESP", "overview_of_class": "How can we design engaging and relevant Holocaust education? How has Holocaust education developed over time? What is its purpose? And what is its future? In this course, we consider and debate the complexities and challenges of Holocaust pedagogy, including responding to learners' emotions and misconceptions. We explore the possible goals of educating about the Holocaust, the merits and challenges of addressing all of the Nazis' target groups, and the relationship between Holocaust education and genocide education. We study the benefits and challenges of prioritizing specific perspectives, including those of victims, survivors, the second and third generations, rescuers, liberators, bystanders, perpetrators, and collaborators. Through theoretical texts, fiction, film, witness testimony, school curricula, and museum and online exhibitions, we explore appropriate and inappropriate teaching methods and consider the design of training for Holocaust educators across formal and informal learning environments.", "name": "Special Topics in Teacher Education", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G01", "topic": "The Holocaust and Education", "course": "351-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SESP/TEACH_ED/351-0/37394", "instructor": ["Daniel Maurice Cohen"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37394", "subject": "TEACH_ED"}, {"school": "SESP", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "Special Topics in Teacher Education", "section": "21", "location": "Annenberg Hall 345", "topic": "Geometry", "course": "351-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:00PM - 9:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SESP/TEACH_ED/351-0/37198", "instructor": ["James J Lynn"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "37198", "subject": "TEACH_ED"}]
