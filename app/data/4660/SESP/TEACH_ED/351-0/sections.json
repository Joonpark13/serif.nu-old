How has Holocaust education developed over time? What is its purpose? And what is its future? In this course, we consider and debate the complexities and challenges of Holocaust pedagogy, including responding to learners' emotions and misconceptions. We explore the possible goals of educating about the Holocaust, the merits and challenges of addressing all of the Nazis' target groups, and the relationship between Holocaust education and genocide education. We study the benefits and challenges of prioritizing specific perspectives, including those of victims, survivors, the second and third generations, rescuers, liberators, bystanders, perpetrators, and collaborators. Through theoretical texts, fiction, film, witness testimony, school curricula, and museum and online exhibitions, we explore appropriate and inappropriate teaching methods and consider the design of training for Holocaust educators across formal and informal learning environments.", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Special Topics in Teacher Education", "title": "SESP TEACH_ED 351-0-20 Special Topics in Teacher Education", "lmod": "2/22/17 6:40 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Daniel Maurice Cohen", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "The Holocaust and Education", "course": "351-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "How can we design engaging and relevant Holocaust education?
