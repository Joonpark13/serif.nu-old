Topics will include analyzing two- and three-dimensional space and figures using distance, angle, similarity, and congruence; informal geometric constructions; right triangles and trigonometry; circles; understanding and applying the Pythagorean Theorem; and coordinate geometry with algebraic representations. Emphases will be placed on geometric reasoning, proof, and modeling. The course will utilize dynamic geometry software as a tool to investigate and model geometric phenomena."}], "lmod": "2/20/17 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "TEACH_ED"}]
