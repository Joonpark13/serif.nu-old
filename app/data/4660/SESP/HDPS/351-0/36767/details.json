From a sociological standpoint, it has traditionally meant assuming the roles and responsibilities of marriage, family, and work. From the perspective of psychology, it has traditionally meant developing a certain kind of identity that situates a person in the adult world while providing a clear self-definition and a sense of unity and life purpose. In recent years, however, both of these perspectives have been challenged, as young people postpone the assumption of adult roles and sometimes take issue with standard expectations regarding pathways to identity achievement. In this class, we will explore what it means to become an adult through a close reading of contemporary literary texts and scientific sources, paying special attention along the way to issues of gender, race/ethnicity, ideology, and life narrative. The process of becoming an adult is conceived as an extended and problematized rite of passage, involving (1) separation, (2) transition, and (3) re-integration."}], "lmod": "2/9/17 6:38 PM (CT)", "subject": "HDPS"}]
