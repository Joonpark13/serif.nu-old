We bring to this examination a particular set of perspectives emphasizing philanthropic giving intended to improve the lives of children and adults and the opportunities afforded them. As a class, we will interrogate this focus and the role of philanthropy in the United States by studying its history, social meanings, motivations, and effects. Students will learn about philanthropy in light of relationships with the nonprofit sector and government, socio-cultural and historical contexts, and influences on why individuals give. In addition to developing rich understandings of theory and actions in philanthropic practices, students will be asked to explore their own conceptions and values about philanthropic purposes and outcomes.<br/><br/>In the lab part of this course, students will have the unique opportunity to experience the challenges and responsibility of giving away money with the intention of promoting a public benefit. Expectations are high for participation and engagement in course assignments and class discussion. Together, students and professors will decide, through deliberation and discussion, why and how this money will be granted to benefit people and causes of their choosing.
