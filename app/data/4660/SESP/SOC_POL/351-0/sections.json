[{"school": "SESP", "overview_of_class": "This course is designed for upper-level students interested in social policy, politics, inequality and law. It explores the \"carceral state\" or the institutions and policies that create a system of criminalization and punishment in the United States. Within the carceral state, the focus of the course is on the history and policies in the United States that led to the highest per capita incarceration rate in the world. The course examines and moves beyond various common explanations for mass incarceration, including crime, politics, public opinion, racism and the \"prison industrial complex.\" It then explores specific policies and practices that created and sustain high levels of incarceration, including sentencing, prison programing, and prosecutorial discretion. Finally, it addresses recent attempts at reform, including policies around re-entry, drug courts and prison conditions. Students read a variety of materials including statutes, policy reports, social science research, law review articles and case law. Assignments include a class presentation and fifteen page research paper.", "name": "Special Topics in Social Policy", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G01", "topic": "Reforming State Government", "course": "351-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SESP/SOC_POL/351-0/37193", "instructor": ["Jerome   Stermer"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37193", "subject": "SOC_POL"}, {"school": "SESP", "overview_of_class": "This course is designed for upper-level students interested in social policy, politics, inequality and law.
