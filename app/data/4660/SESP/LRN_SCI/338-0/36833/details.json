The course starts with a reflection on the relationship between teaching philosophy and technology use. We will also explore children&#8217;s everyday uses of technology. We then will take an in-depth look at three emerging technologies: personal broadcasting (e.g., blogs, podcasts), Wikipedia, and gaming. In each case, you will get extensive experience with the technology, examine empirical models that can be applied to the technologies, and reflect on how the technologies intersect with your teaching philosophy. The course also provides exposure to a variety of technologies that are common school settings."}], "lmod": "2/21/17 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "LRN_SCI"}]
