A &quot;future&quot; is a binding, legal agreement to buy or sell a given asset or commodity. An &quot;option&quot; is a right-but not an obligation-to buy or sell an asset at a certain price in a given period. These derivative securities are used by individuals and companies for speculative gain and as a means to manage risk while reducing the cost of doing business. The growth in options and futures has been accompanied by innovative products, such as bundled portfolios of options, futures, and their underlying securities. This course provides students with the skills needed to value and use options, futures, and related financial contracts. Topics include arbitrage, hedging, spreading, pricing relations, models such as Black Scholes and cost of carry, and currency and interest-rate swaps."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites: FINANCE 202 and FINANCE 364, or equivalents."}], "lmod": "2/21/17 6:41 PM (CT)", "subject": "FINANCE"}]
