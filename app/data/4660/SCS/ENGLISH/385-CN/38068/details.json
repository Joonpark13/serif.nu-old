In response, literary artists have created dark visions of fictional worlds dominated by the collective and hostile to individuality. We will begin by studying Utopia by Thomas More, an influential Renaissance book that portrays a harmonious and virtuous collective society. Then we will turn our attention to the opposite of that, the &quot;dystopian&quot; worlds created by George Orwell in 1984, Margaret Atwood in The Handmaid's Tale, and Eugene Ionesco in the absurdist play Rhinoceros. Students will also be asked to do a presentation on a dystopian film or television series (or another dystopian literary work)."}], "lmod": "2/20/17 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
