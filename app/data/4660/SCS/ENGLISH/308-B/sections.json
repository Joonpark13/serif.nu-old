[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course is for writers who seek to further develop voice, skill, and technique in writing various forms of creative nonfiction, including the personal essay and literary journalism. Students will engage in close reading and study of well crafted, published creative nonfiction essays to expand their awareness of the range of subject and technique in creative nonfiction writing. Emphasis will be placed on the artful use of language. This course is discussion and workshop-based. Using published works we all deem as effective and artful examples of creative nonfiction writing, we'll come up with a set of criteria with which to evaluate student essays submitted to the workshop. Students will write two full-length creative nonfiction essays, one of which will be a literary journalism piece. Any student who is already working on a creative nonfiction piece and would like to continue working on it in this course, please feel free to bring it. Toward end of quarter, the instructor will talk about publishing opportunities for creative nonfiction essays, including how to submit your work, write a cover letter, and how to best determine which journals will like your work.
