[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course focuses on early-stage companies (including, but not only, startups) and how they are structured, financed, managed, scaled, and sold. It is an example-driven course that demands substantial research outside class; past students have mentioned spending between 2 to 4 hours each week outside of class on research - if you are not prepared to do work outside class each week to prepare for the following week, do not take this course. While the course focuses on technology companies, this is interpreted broadly to include telecommunications, financial technology, medical technology, hardware innovation, and other topics; this is not a sector-specific course focused on \"pure tech\" (e.g. social media startups, ad tech, etc.).", "name": "Entrepreneurship and Technology", "section": "14", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "369-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SCS/ORG_BEH/369-CN/38103", "instructor": ["Karl Tan Muth"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "38103", "subject": "ORG_BEH"}]
