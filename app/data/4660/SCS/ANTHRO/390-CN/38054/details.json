We will cover social, economic and cultural forces that create variation in human health and well-being in populations worldwide. The course highlights the importance of employing a population-based vs. a purely clinical approach to solving these health problems. Methods for assessing and tracking patterns in population health will be reviewed. Additionally, students will learn about key players in international health and understand important shifts in donor policies towards healthcare delivery. Finally, we will look at how awareness of the need for ethical oversight of research in resource-poor settings is increasing. The course will orient students to the skills and sensitivities that must be mastered in order to understand the structural underpinnings and culture-specific interpretations of health and sickness needed for international public health practices. This course is also listed as GBL HLTH 301. Carries social science credit."}], "lmod": "2/20/17 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
