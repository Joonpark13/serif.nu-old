Class discussions will deal with how the brain works and how it plays a role not only in human behavior such as motivation, learning and sensory perception, but also in psycholpathology. We will also discuss issues raised by new medical technologies. There are no prerequisites for this course, but students should be prepared to be challenged both by the amount and complexity of the course material"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "None."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "By the end of the course, students should:<br/>1. have a working vocabulary of basic neurobiological terms.<br/>2. have a general understanding of human brain anatomy, physiology and chemistry.<br/>3. be able to read and comprehend neurobiological articles (programs) presented in the popular media.<br/>4. be able to critically evaluate new medical findings and technologies dealing with the human nervous system."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Carlson's Physiology of Behavior ISBN 9780205239399"}], "lmod": "2/16/17 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
