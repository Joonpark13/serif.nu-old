[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course is the continuation of PHYSICS 130-A,B. Wave motion, optics, and introduction to the basic concepts of modern physics including quantum mechanics, relativity, and atomic physics. The course focuses on conceptual understanding of basic physical principles and their real-world applications. Demonstration experiments will be used to illustrate physical phenomena and concepts. Requires concurrent enrollment in the PHYSICS 131-C lab. Lab times are Tuesdays 8-9:50 pm; Wednesdays 9-10:50 am; Saturdays 12-1:50 pm; or Saturdays 2-3:50 pm. Labs will meet for the first time after the first lecture session.", "name": "College Physics III", "section": "66", "location": "Technological Institute L211", "topic": "", "course": "130-C", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SCS/PHYSICS/130-C/38128", "instructor": ["Arthur Gerard   Schmidt"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "38128", "subject": "PHYSICS"}]
