[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This is a rigorous course that deals with difficult concepts in macroeconomics, some of which are \"undecided\" even among top scholars in this field, including advisors to heads of state and faculty members at Northwestern and elsewhere. I do my best to provide information on alternate theories of macroeconomic mechanisms as well as my own position so that students can appreciate and debate various viewpoints presented by academics, businesspeople, journalists, and policymakers. The \"chalkboard mathematics\" I present in this course intermittently (but infrequently) exceeds the bounds of basic calculus, but occasionally will include game theory exercises in an actor-counterparty net-gains framework (e.g. Kaldor-Hicks models) and conceptualizations of advanced modeling (at the level of MATH 234 Vector Calculus). There will be no graded \"chalkboard math\" or proofs on the exam; no graded work exceeds MATH 230 (Differential Calculus with Multivariable Functions). You are graded on your conceptual understanding of the underlying mathematics; this is not a \"quant whiz\" class. Statistical knowledge at the level of STAT 202 is highly recommended and considered a minimum.", "name": "International Trade", "section": "12", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "361-CN", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SCS/ECON/361-CN/38062", "instructor": ["Karl Tan Muth"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "38062", "subject": "ECON"}]
