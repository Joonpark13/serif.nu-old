[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, we will be studying film from a psychological perspective. There are three aspects to this perspective: the psychology of the characters, of the viewers, and of the creator. Readings that present these three aspects of the psychology of cinema will be a part of the course, as well as readings about each of the individual movies. All of the films viewed in the course are psychologically insightful and have received critical acclaim, and include Vertigo (Alfred Hitchcock), Ordinary People (Robert Redford), Autumn Sonata (Ingmar Bergman), Blue Velvet (David Lynch), and Hannah and Her Sisters (Woody Allen). The chief assignment is writing a paper on a movie of your choice. There will also be a quiz at the beginning of each class except for the first and last class.
