[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course helps students find their writing voice through independent reporting, coaching and class critiques. It emphasizes visual story telling - i.e., photos and text together. This course focuses on reaching a specific audience - professional, academic, familial. It does so by allowing the student to select an appropriate topic for a photo essay. Students research, report and write their stories which become the script for a final project that resembles a slideshow. Coaching and class critiques help students along the way. Some weeks the instruction is remote-site - computer interaction and telephone discussion with the professor. A schedule will be provided early in the quarter.", "name": "Visual Storytelling", "section": "12", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "201-B", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SCS/JRN_WRIT/201-B/38286", "instructor": ["David L Nelson"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "38286", "subject": "JRN_WRIT"}]
