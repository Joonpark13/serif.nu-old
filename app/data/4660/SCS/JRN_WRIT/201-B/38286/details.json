It emphasizes visual story telling - i.e., photos and text together. This course focuses on reaching a specific audience - professional, academic, familial. It does so by allowing the student to select an appropriate topic for a photo essay. Students research, report and write their stories which become the script for a final project that resembles a slideshow. Coaching and class critiques help students along the way. Some weeks the instruction is remote-site - computer interaction and telephone discussion with the professor. A schedule will be provided early in the quarter."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Instructor approval if student has not taken JRN WRIT 201-A Writing for Media or its equivalent."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "How to write and tell stories to a specific audience using text/photo presentations."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Provided by instructor."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Professional work level and attitude required."}], "lmod": "2/16/17 6:41 PM (CT)", "subject": "JRN_WRIT"}]
