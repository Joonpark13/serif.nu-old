[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Far back in the mists of time, the poet Hesiod sanctioned, \"if anyone has a fresh grief in his spirit and his troubled heart is parched with sorrow,\" when a bard or storyteller then sings a song about the glorious accomplishments of men of old, and about the blessed gods who dwell in Olympus, soon the sorrowful person \"forgets his woes, and does not remember any of his burdens, which have been dispelled by this gift of song bestowed by the goddesses.\" This course presents a tapestry woven of the multicolored strands of mythic story and of song, the fabric of the eternal. Presented in a five-week format (along with others during each academic term), this course meets for five Saturdays from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm: 5/13, 5/20, 5/27, 6/4, 6/10.
