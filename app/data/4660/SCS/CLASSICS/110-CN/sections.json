[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "The intent of this course is to familiarize students with a wide range of Greek- and Latin-derived words encountered in scientific and primarily medical fields. Students learn the basic components and an understanding of the underlying principles of word formation, which includes acquiring a basic vocabulary of word roots, prefixes, and suffixes, much of which is a matter of applied memorization. It also includes analysis of words, aiming at an understanding of the relationship of their various components. Students will be able to develop, practice, reinforce and test these skills through a variety of in-class exercises, as well as regular tests (weekly quizzes, a midterm and a cumulative final exam). Once equipped with the knowledge of how all such words function, the meaning of thousands of scientific words encountered in context may be inferred with reasonable assurance of accuracy. <br/><br/>Another aim of the course is to acquaint students with the ancient Greek and Roman roots of scientific (specifically medical) inquiry. We will explore the ancients' philosophical ideas and understanding of the workings of the human body and mind and their views on health, healing, and disease patterns and patient care. We will also examine developments in science broadly speaking, and discoveries and advancements in ancient anatomy, physiology, surgery and pharmacology with ramifications for modern science in general, and medicine in particular.", "name": "Scientific Vocabulary through Classical Roots", "section": "66", "location": "Parkes Hall 214", "topic": "", "course": "110-CN", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SCS/CLASSICS/110-CN/38106", "instructor": ["Graziela Marieta Byros"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "38106", "subject": "CLASSICS"}]
