[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "When he entered office, President Barack Obama sought to change the language of the previous administration's \"global war on terror,\" recasting the conflict as \"overseas contingency operation.\" Obama's concern about the language of terrorism coupled with his administration's policy of assassinating terrorism suspects across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa with drones and special operations forces was only the latest twist in the relationship between U.S. presidential power and \"international terrorism\" in the post-Vietnam War era. This course seeks to understand that relationship historically. It asks: Why did \"international terrorism\" become so prominent in the national security imaginary of successive U.S. presidential administrations since the sixties? Why have armed strugglers targeted the United States with spectacular political violence over that period? Why have U.S. presidents been selective in designating some acts terrorism and others not? How did the emerging U.S. counterterrorism apparatus connect to the \"punitive turn\" that historians have located in U.S. politics and culture from the 1970s? This seminar course focuses on these questions and others as we aim to understand the connection between terrorism, U.S. politics, and U.S. global power. We will analyze an array of primary sources including declassified government documents, film, and political posters. In addition, we will refer to recent scholarship in U.S. history, the history of terrorism, and U.S. empire.", "name": "Topics in History:", "section": "64", "location": "Harris Hall L06", "topic": "U.S. Presidents and Terrorism", "course": "392-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SCS/HISTORY/392-CN/38069", "instructor": ["Alex Michael Hobson"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "38069", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
