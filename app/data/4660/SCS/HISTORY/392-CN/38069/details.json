This course seeks to understand that relationship historically. It asks: Why did &quot;international terrorism&quot; become so prominent in the national security imaginary of successive U.S. presidential administrations since the sixties? Why have armed strugglers targeted the United States with spectacular political violence over that period? Why have U.S. presidents been selective in designating some acts terrorism and others not? How did the emerging U.S. counterterrorism apparatus connect to the &quot;punitive turn&quot; that historians have located in U.S. politics and culture from the 1970s? This seminar course focuses on these questions and others as we aim to understand the connection between terrorism, U.S. politics, and U.S. global power. We will analyze an array of primary sources including declassified government documents, film, and political posters. In addition, we will refer to recent scholarship in U.S. history, the history of terrorism, and U.S. empire."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "None."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "To put the relationship among international terrorism, the U.S. presidency, and the &quot;surveillance&quot; state in historical context; to ponder some of the debates about terrorism and what to do about it in the social sciences and in the public sphere."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar<br/>group work<br/>class participation<br/>writing assignments."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "papers<br/>class participation<br/>attendance"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Paul R.
