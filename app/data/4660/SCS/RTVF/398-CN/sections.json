[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Our daily dose of news in the United States tends to be rife with reports of conspiracies and scandals, real or imagined. Such stories tend to be riddled with the machinations of political parties, whistleblowers, corporate influence, corruption in government, media manipulation, financial and sexual misconduct, espionage, cover-ups, and intrigue. Once such stories break, the revelation of the players, motives, methods, and results make excellent fodder for filmmakers. In this course we will view, discuss, and write about films which dramatize scandals - both factual and fictional - because, as the film-going public knows, the subject of scandal can make for some exciting times at the movies, besides commenting on the state of our American society and media culture in any given era. Are these films meant to shed light on wrongdoing, serve as a warning to a naive public, or merely meant to entertain? Films to be viewed may include Breach, Eight Men Out, The Insider, JFK, Reversal of Fortune, Silkwood, Spotlight, Far From Heaven, The Front.
