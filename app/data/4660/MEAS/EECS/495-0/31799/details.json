Examples include peering agreements among Internet Service Providers, <br/>licensing agreements for wireless spectrum, designing the right incentives for crowdsourcing platforms, competition among producers of electricity, engaging robotic groups to cooperate. Game theory is a basic tool for understanding such interactions. This course gives an interdisciplinary introduction to the fundamentals of game theory and it applications to such networked systems. <br/>The pre-requisites are basic optimization and mathematical maturity or consent of the instructor."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "PREREQUISITES<br/>Linear Algebra (e.g. Math 240 or GenEng 205-1), Probability (e.g. EECS 302), basic optimization and mathematical maturity"}], "lmod": "2/9/17 6:35 PM (CT)", "subject": "EECS"}]
