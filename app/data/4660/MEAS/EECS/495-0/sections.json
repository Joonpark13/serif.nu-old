Game theory is a basic tool for understanding such interactions. This course gives an interdisciplinary introduction to the fundamentals of game theory and it applications to such networked systems. <br/>The pre-requisites are basic optimization and mathematical maturity or consent of the instructor.", "name": "Special Topics in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science", "section": "68", "location": "Technological Institute L150", "topic": "Game Theory and Networked Systems", "course": "495-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/MEAS/EECS/495-0/31799", "instructor": ["Randall A Berry", "Ermin   Wei"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31799", "subject": "EECS"}, {"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "Special Topics in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science", "section": "70", "location": "Annenberg Hall 303", "topic": "Tang.
