[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "Description<br/><br/>(to become CS351-2) Second in a 3-course series on the methods and theory of computer graphics, this project-oriented course explores how to describe shapes, movement, and lighting effects beyond the abilities of the standard OpenGL rendering pipeline. It includes interactive particle systems, simple rigid-body dynamics, explicit and implicit dynamics solvers (suitable for smoke, simple fluids and cloth) and an introduction to ray tracing (chrome, glass, and diffraction) with a few basic ideas for global illumination.<br/><br/> This course satisfies the CS Depth Interfaces & the project requirement.<br/><br/>DETAILED COURSE TOPICS: The course has just two topics, but they are very broad: A. Particles and Movement: 1) Abandon all polygons to make 'shapeless' shapes (fireworks, swarms of bees, rain, snow, grass, etc.) from clouds of particles. How close can we get to modeling each particle in a cloud of steam? 2) Moving particles coupled together can simulate many interesting materials (rope, water, smoke, cloth, etc.). We'll explore both 'explicit' and 'implicit' solvers that make soft things move and behave realistically. B. Light Done Right: we'll learn ray tracing, BRDFs and light units, extended light sources (soft shadows), and some basic global illumination ideas. You will make pictures that look much more like photographs than OpenGL, with shadows, chrome reflections, transparency, and complex surfaces.", "name": "Special Topics in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science", "section": "21", "location": "Pancoe Building Abbott Aud", "topic": "Intermediate Computer Graphics", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/MEAS/EECS/395-0/31760", "instructor": ["John E Tumblin"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31760", "subject": "EECS"}, {"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "CATALOG DESCRIPTION: The course discusses modern processor architectures, the constraints that limit their design and programmability, and promising techniques to mitigate these constraints.<br/><br/>DETAILED COURSE TOPICS: The course will have a seminar format.
