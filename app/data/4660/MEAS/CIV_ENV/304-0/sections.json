[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "COURSE DESCRIPTION / The course explores problems that arise in the planning and management of large-scale CEE systems. We introduce a set of quantitative tools to develop prescriptive models that can be used to address each of the problems. The tools are drawn from decision analysis,dynamic programming, linear and nonlinear programming, etc. <br/><br/>COURSE OBJECTIVES / <br/>1. To encourage the development of a \"systems perspective\" necessary for the planning and management of large scale civil and environmental engineering systems;<br/>2. To gain experience in formulating and solving a range of civil and environmental engineering problems; and <br/>3. To enable the students to become proficient in the use of commercial software to solve engineering problems.", "name": "Civil and Environmental Engineering Systems Analysis", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute M120", "topic": "", "course": "304-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/MEAS/CIV_ENV/304-0/31312", "instructor": ["Pablo Luis   Durango-Cohen"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31312", "subject": "CIV_ENV"}]
