[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "The flow of fluids is important in many biomedical applications ranging from blood flow in the human body to drug delivery. BME 270 provides a general introduction to fluid mechanics, both statics and dynamics. The laboratory component of the class consists of take-home experiments using aquarium pumps.<br/><br/>BMD_ENG 270 is a required course for the BS in BME. Undergraduates take this course at the end of their second year or at the beginning of their third year. The course uses integral calculus and differential equations, so these courses are prerequisites. It also helps to have taken physics and thermodynamics prior to this course. An equivalent course, ME 241, may also be taken.", "name": "Fluid Mechanics", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute L211", "topic": "", "course": "270-0", "meeting_time": ["TuWeTh 5:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/MEAS/BMD_ENG/270-0/30435", "instructor": ["Mitra J Hartmann"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "30435", "subject": "BMD_ENG"}]
