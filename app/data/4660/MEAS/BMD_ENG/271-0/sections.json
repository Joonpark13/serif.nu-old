Students will learn methods of computing stresses in several types of structural and machine components and the fundamental approach for determining internal forces and stresses in indeterminate structures - use of equations of equilibrium, force-temperature-deformation relations, and expressions for the geometry of the deformations. This will be accomplished in a series of lectures taught by a CIV instructor. In a weekly discussion section lead by a BME instructor, students will apply that knowledge to biological and physiological systems.<br/><br/>BME students typically take this course in their sophomore year.", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Introduction to Biomechanics", "title": "MEAS BMD_ENG 271-0-20 Introduction to Biomechanics", "lmod": "2/22/17 6:34 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-3411", "instructor_name": "John W Rudnicki", "instructor_addr": "Technological Institute, Rm A333, 2145 Sheridan Rd, EV CAMPUS"}, {"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Gloria   Kim", "instructor_addr": ""}, {"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Maria Arantzazu Alarcon", "instructor_addr": ""}], "associated_classes": [{"component": "DIS", "room": "Tech Institute Lecture Room 5", "meeting_time": "Th 11:00AM - 11:50AM"}], "topic": "", "course": "271-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "The objective of this course is to provide BME undergraduate students with concepts and skills required to develop an ability to visualize and understand the fundamental behavior of structures and solids.
