[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "This course covers the background of rapid prototyping methods and the operation of different types of rapid prototyping and reverse engineering equipment available in Northwestern's rapid prototyping facilities. Students will review the fundamentals and theory behind rapid prototyping methods, the different types of methods and materials, applications of rapid prototyping technology, and the use of advanced CAD modeling within rapid prototyping. The course will then transition to lab work, where students will learn the operation of rapid prototyping machines, reverse engineering scanners, and CAD surfacing software.<br/><br/>The goal of this class is to create a proficient student operator of available rapid prototyping machines, and tp allow students to reverse engineer a product to allow manipulation at a CAD software level.<br/><br/>DSGN 348 topics are independent of any other course.", "name": "Rapid Prototyping", "section": "20", "location": "Ford Eng Design Cntr SB310", "topic": "", "course": "348-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 3:00PM - 6:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/MEAS/DSGN/348-0/31924", "instructor": ["Michael Joseph Beltran"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31924", "subject": "DSGN"}]
