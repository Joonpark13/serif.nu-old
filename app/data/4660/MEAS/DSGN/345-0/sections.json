You will learn the basics of creating a manufacturing setup using parts and blanks, and establishing various machining operations to machine everything from simple parts to complex surfaces. We review basic design for manufacturing, general machining rules, and the NX manufacturing environment, including various types of operations, tool generation, and establishing proper manufacturing geometry.<br/><br/>Classes balance lecture and software use so you can familiarize yourself with NX manufacturing. For a final project, you will design and manufacture the modeling, g-code generation, and CNC manufacturing of a simple part.<br/><br/>DSGN 345 topics are independent of any other course.<br/><br/>Teaching method: 50% lecture and 50% software use.", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Computer-Aided Manufacturing: NX", "title": "MEAS DSGN 345-0-20 Computer-Aided Manufacturing: NX", "lmod": "2/26/17 6:35 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/467-1995", "instructor_name": "Michael Joseph Beltran", "instructor_addr": "Technological Institute, Rm AG28, 2145 Sheridan Rd, EV CAMPUS"}], "topic": "", "course": "345-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Prerequisite: Students must have taken DSGN 106-1 and 106-2, and one of the following: DSGN 240, DSGN 245 or Mech_Eng 240, or have received permission from the instructor in order to enroll in the course.", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This half-unit course on CAM uses the NX manufacturing environment to program machining operations for CNC milling.
