All issues relating to patents and patentability of inventions, copyrights and the protection of the expressions of ideas, trademarks and source identifiers will be reviewed and analyzed in the context of multiple engineering domains. While these domains will initially be functional (mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, industrial engineering, computer science, etc), we will explore how new combinations of traditionally functional knowledge (e.g. ME+CS, CS+CE, IE+CE?) are the fertile areas of new commercial markets and wealth creation.", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Intellectual Property and Innovation", "title": "MEAS DSGN 350-0-20 Intellectual Property and Innovation", "lmod": "2/22/17 6:35 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Daniel P.
