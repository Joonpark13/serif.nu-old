Lay out a program in a formal process to assure a very high degree of success in the product development process. Select candidate materials from which to make the article, by optimizing among qualities that meet multiple performance requirements. Select candidate manufacturing processes that meet economic and parts-quality constraints. Validate the material and manufacturing process decisions for economic viability. Recognize opportunities to do continuous improvement of the article by optimizing the design based on research, and refining the material and manufacturing process decisions. Have a portfolio of work products developed during the course."}], "lmod": "2/6/17 8:33 AM (CT)", "subject": "DSGN"}]
