What is the role of storytelling and narrative in understanding the complexities of human rights issues? What kind of questions does fiction raise about individual and collective responsibilities toward others? What can close attention to literary stylistics (voice, person and perspective) teach us about the limitations of our common sense approach to rights and ethics? In this course, we will investigate how literature has responded to the challenges and prospects presented to the modern world by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) that recognized the &quot;inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family.&quot; Through examples from Hungary, Palestine, Chile, Somalia and India, we will gain insight into how world literature actively participates in establishing what it means to be a human being entitled to freedom, life and liberty.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to sophomores and above</li> <br/><li>Open for Cross-Registration</li><br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "2/8/17 6:37 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
