[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "<p>This class will enable students to gain a great overview into to the fundamentals of researching, planning, shooting and editing video for documentaries. Students will learn about the power of documentaries and how they can be used to address issues of social significance. They will also explore the history of documentary video production, current trends and will learn to develop critical viewing skills. In the same way as you would be expected to read books for other courses, in this course students will view and critique a range of contemporary documentary films. Additionally, students will lean to research for, collect and analyze primary sources - e.g. news stories, first-person accounts, government records, ephemera, found footage that are stored in archives libraries, museums and online databases. Given our unique location in the Middle East, one of the most diverse and fast developing Arab nations in the world, students will be encouraged to explore the social, cultural and political resources within Qatar. Students are expected to complete a 10-minute documentary by the end of the 5-week course.</p>", "name": "Documentary", "section": "70", "location": "Northwestern Qatar Room 1-213", "topic": "", "course": "368-0", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeSu 01:30PM - 04:20PM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/DOHA/JOUR/368-0/30727", "instructor": ["Miriam   Berg"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "30727", "subject": "JOUR"}]
