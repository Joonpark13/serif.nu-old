[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "<p>This course provides an in-depth look at inequality in America, in which some individuals and groups \"get what, when, and how\" (Lasswell 1936) more than others. The class will contrast the promise of equality with the reality of inequality in American democracy today. Although the primary focus is on America, relevant comparisons to Qatar and the Gulf will be introduced to investigate how these concepts travel across contexts and raise awareness of global forms of inequality. Students will understand the social construction of difference (race, class, gender, and sexuality) and the impact of intersectionality. Specific issues, such as immigration, policing, and health, will be explored through a comparative and critical perspective, and the prospects of social change will be assessed.</p>", "name": "Advanced Topics in Political Science", "section": "70", "location": "Northwestern Qatar Room G-200", "topic": "Inequality in America", "course": "387-0", "meeting_time": ["TuSu 10:30AM - 11:50AM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/DOHA/POLI_SCI/387-0/30752", "instructor": ["Jocelyn S Mitchell"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "30752", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
