It starts with looking at the history of Zionism and the idea of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine; then it moves to discuss the consequences of the implementation of this idea within colonial and postcolonial contexts. Particular importance is given to the Palestine war in 1948, the subsequent creation of Israel, and regional conflicts between Israel and neighbouring Arab countries that have had devastating impacts. Chief among them are the emergence of the Palestinian refugees issue and the lack Palestinian statehood. Following the chronology of the conflict with its war and peace episodes, the course intends to critically discuss conflicting narratives, the role of regional and international players, and the long-lasting ramifications of the conflict that have affected the shape and politics of the Middle East.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to sophomores and above</li> <br/><li>Open for Cross-Registration</li><br/><li>Satisfies Middle Eastern Studies Certificate</li><br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "2/6/17 6:37 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
