Students work to develop critical perspectives on mass media as they consider the relationships between media institutions, content, culture, audiences and communities. The impact of globalization and the role of technological change are important variables. Students also consider the historical background of several media industries, including newspapers, film, radio, the Internet, television and music. The course examines content and media messages delivered as news, entertainment, persuasion, public relations, and advertising. Global media systems are playing an increasingly large role and are a vital area of study within the class, as is the notion of ethical communication.
