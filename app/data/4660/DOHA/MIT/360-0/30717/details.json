Students will analyze structure, scene writing, and dialogue as they develop a story from an outline to a full narrative. Through the practice of writing the feature, students will (1) investigate the needs and desires of their characters to generate genuine, believable conflict that actively drives the story forward; (2) brainstorm, evaluate, and assess materials that would be suitable for a full-length script; and (3) master the structural elements of a script to revise their own work as well as to analyze effectively the work of others. By the end of the course, students will be able to (1) develop an engaging narrative that takes their characters on a transformative journey; (2) surprise their audience with highly flawed and active characters; and (3) strengthen their voice through elegant and impactful writing.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: MIT 260-0</li><br/><li>Open to sophomores and above</li> <br/><li>Students must be present on the first day or they will be dropped from the class</li><br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "2/6/17 8:35 AM (CT)", "subject": "MIT"}]
