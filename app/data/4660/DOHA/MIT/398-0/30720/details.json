In the first half of the semester, they will explore some of the theories and methods that communication scholars have used to study persuasive communication. In the second half of the semester, they will employ some of these theories and methods to develop a detailed critique of a rhetorical text (literary, audio-visual, performative, interactive, multimedia) of their choice. Students will write several short papers that summarize and comment upon the various critical theories and methods. Each student will co-teach (with me) one critical theory or method. Students will write a detailed rhetorical critique of a text of their choice in four steps (Text Description, Critical Stance, Interpretation, Evaluation) and will share their critique with the class in a formal presentation.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to sophomores and above</li> <br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "2/14/17 6:38 PM (CT)", "subject": "MIT"}]
