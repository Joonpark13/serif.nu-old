Surveying foundational scholarship in television and new media theory, the class examines a range of critical approaches, including aesthetic/formal analysis, narrative criticism, ideological analysis, political economy, cultural criticism, and audience reception. Working to advance their analytical skills, students will practice using these approaches to examine issues of style, form, ideology, and identity (e.g., race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, and nation) in a range of historical and contemporary television shows, commercials, and online videos. Ultimately, the goals of the course are 1) to acquaint students with a range of critical and methodological tools for analyzing the production, reception, and cultural meanings of television; and 2) to strengthen and expand students' understanding of diverse TV content, contexts, and convergences at different times in history.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to sophomores and above</li> <br/><li>Open for Cross-Registration</li><br/><li>Satisfies Media &amp; Politics Minor and Contemporary Media Sequence</li><br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "2/13/17 6:37 PM (CT)", "subject": "MIT"}]
