[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "<p>The goal of this course is to address some of the major trends and issues in cinema from the MENA region, including the contexts of their production and audiences. We will discuss how we can integrate critical theory relevant to the Middle East and North Africa with the weekly screenings of works of cinematic art produced in cities throughout the region from the 1950s to the present day. The course gives special attention to cinema, but topics will range from photography in colonies and royal courts, to video installation in galleries, to contemporary social media. We will learn how to analyze images, and how to situate them within a historical context that pays particular attention to the intersections of art and politics.</p>", "name": "National Cinema", "section": "70", "location": "Northwestern Qatar Room 2-255", "topic": "Middle East and North Africa", "course": "351-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 02:30PM - 04:20PM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/DOHA/MIT/351-0/30716", "instructor": ["Kaveh Travis Askari"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "30716", "subject": "MIT"}]
