[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "Although media made for girls has long been derided as silly and undeserving of close attention, to the millions of preteen and teen girls who consume it, it is anything but insignificant. From Nancy Drew novels in the 1930s to beach party movies in the 1960s, from 1970s sitcoms such as The Brady Bunch to contemporary films and TV shows such as Whip It, Wadjda, and K.C. Undercover, girls' media forms have functioned as important historical sites for the negotiation of cultural politics and youthful feminine ideals. In order to shed light on the oft-overlooked history of girls' media in both the U.S. and abroad, this course offers a critical investigation of popular girls' media from the 1930s to the present, including novels, films, TV shows, advertisements, music videos, teen magazines, and toys. We will investigate girls' media artifacts as commercial and aesthetic texts through which girls have interfaced with lessons about gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, national identity, generation, and ability at different historical moments in both Western and non-Western contexts. We will also consider how the landscape of girls' media production has changed, and resisted change, over time. Finally, we will examine the expansion of female youth culture beyond consumer-oriented activities to those involving girls' cultural production as we compare girl-made and adult-made girls' media.", "name": "Film, Media & Gender", "section": "70", "location": "Northwestern Qatar Room 2-255", "topic": "Girls' Media Culture", "course": "325-0", "meeting_time": ["TuSu 03:30PM - 05:20PM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/DOHA/MIT/325-0/30712", "instructor": ["Kirsten Marie Pike"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "30712", "subject": "MIT"}]
