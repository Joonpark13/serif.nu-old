We will examine case studies of current practices, including: managing genetics of native and ex situ and zoo populations, reintroducing and restoring plants and animals to the wild, selection in harvested populations, evaluating genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation, creating habitat corridors, measuring genetic diversity, and responses to climate change. To synthesize new concepts and theory we will engage in group problem-solving and computer simulation exercises.", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Conservation Genetics", "title": "TGS PBC 430-0-20 Conservation Genetics", "lmod": "2/26/17 6:42 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/835-6959", "instructor_name": "Jeremie B Fant", "instructor_addr": "Hogan Hall, Room 6-140B"}, {"instructor_phone": "847/835-6978", "instructor_name": "Stuart   Wagenius", "instructor_addr": "156 PCSC Chicago Botanic Garden, Glencoe"}], "topic": "", "course": "430-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "In this course we will learn how basic evolutionary and genetic principles guide policies about the conservation and management of wildlife, game, and plant populations.
