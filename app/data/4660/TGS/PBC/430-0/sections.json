[{"school": "TGS", "overview_of_class": "In this course we will learn how basic evolutionary and genetic principles guide policies about the conservation and management of wildlife, game, and plant populations. We will read and discuss current research in the primary literature including both molecular and quantitative genetic examples and compare them to institutional policies that deal with conservation genetics. We will examine case studies of current practices, including: managing genetics of native and ex situ and zoo populations, reintroducing and restoring plants and animals to the wild, selection in harvested populations, evaluating genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation, creating habitat corridors, measuring genetic diversity, and responses to climate change. To synthesize new concepts and theory we will engage in group problem-solving and computer simulation exercises.", "name": "Conservation Genetics", "section": "20", "location": "Frances Searle Building 2107", "topic": "", "course": "430-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 3:30PM - 4:20PM", "We 3:30PM - 5:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/TGS/PBC/430-0/34603", "instructor": ["Jeremie B Fant", "Stuart   Wagenius"], "class_attributes": "Department Majors Only<br/><br/>Jrs, Srs, Grad Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "34603", "subject": "PBC"}]
