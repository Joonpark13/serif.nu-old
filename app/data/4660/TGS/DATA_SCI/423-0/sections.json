[{"school": "TGS", "overview_of_class": "From robotics, speech recognition, and analytics to finance and social network analysis, machine learning has become one of the most useful set of scientific tools of our age. With this course we want to bring interested students and researchers from a wide array of disciplines up to speed on the power and wide applicability of machine learning. The ultimate aim of the course is to equip you with all the modelling and optimization tools you'll need in order to formulate and solve problems of interest in a machine learning framework. We hope to help build these skills through lectures and reading materials which introduce machine learning in the context of its many applications, as well as by describing in a detailed but user-friendly manner the modern techniques from nonlinear optimization used to solve them. In addition to a well curated collection of reference materials, registered students will receive a draft of a forthcoming manuscript authored by the instructors on machine learning to use as class notes.<br/><br/>This course counts towards the AI breadth requirement for both undergraduate and graduate students. Students may receive credit for both this course and EECS 349.<br/>Course is crosslisted with Data_Sci 423", "name": "Machine Learning: Foundations, Applications, and Algorithms", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute AUD", "topic": "", "course": "423-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/TGS/DATA_SCI/423-0/37191", "instructor": ["Aggelos K Katsaggelos"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37191", "subject": "DATA_SCI"}]
