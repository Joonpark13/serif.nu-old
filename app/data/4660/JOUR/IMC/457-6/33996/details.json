This course provides students with a toolkit derived from theories, case studies, and class exercises that can be effectively deployed in planning for, and responding to, these issues. The combination of topics is designed to develop skills in integrative thinking, navigating organizations, and managing unexpected events. Class discussion and assignments focus on applying the theories, cases, and experiences to real-world IMC examples as well as learning from the integration challenges companies are facing. Advisory notes for online students: Students will benefit from having experience managing in multi-function enterprises, and/or prior course work in organizational behavior. It is suggested that either IMC 455 Consumer Insight or IMC 452 Marketing Management be taken in advance of IMC 457."}], "lmod": "2/13/17 6:36 PM (CT)", "subject": "IMC"}]
