[{"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "IMC 465 Brand Equity helps students learn and apply principles around building, managing, measuring and protecting brand equity. Fundamental to this course is the proposition that brands are not cost centers, but assets that can be leveraged to help organizations meet their business objectives.<br/><br/><br/>The topics covered focus on strategic application of either building or leveraging brand equity. Examples include brand assessment, segmentation, brand architecture, positioning, brand extension, brand alliances, and brand valuation. While we will touch on the creative aspects of communicating a memorable and compelling brand identity, the emphasis of the course will not be on marketing communication tactics. Rather it will focus on the issues that organizations must address as part of creating a comprehensive brand strategy. Class activities include readings, case studies, short papers, and a term project.<br/><br/>Advisory note for online students: It is recommended that students complete IMC 452-6 Marketing Management in advance of this class.", "name": "Brand Equity", "section": "20", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "465-6", "meeting_time": ["TBA"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/JOUR/IMC/465-6/33999", "instructor": ["Ariel   Goldfarb"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33999", "subject": "IMC"}]
