Student teams will receive a brand challenge briefing directly from the client, and then work with faculty guidance through key stages to develop a marketing communications program to address brand needs. Along the way students will clarify the marketing objective, use qualitative and quantitative means to understand consumers, uncover brand building insights, identify an integrating idea, hold a strategic work session with the client, solidify brand positioning and develop a winning message strategy that includes creative content, consumer engagement platforms and measurement. Teams will compete to &quot;win the business&quot; and finish the quarter with a formal presentation of their recommended IMC plan directly to the client. Three faculty members with complementary experience in brand strategy, digital communications and creative development will share lecture and student engagement opportunities."}], "lmod": "2/12/17 6:45 PM (CT)", "subject": "IMC"}]
