The course will examine methods for effective communication using images and design as a language. It prepares students for further study in photojournalism, video storytelling, publication design and interactive storytelling. The class will follow the narrative arc of visual storytelling from the ancient 32,000 year old Chauvet Cave paintings in southern France all the way to the sophisticated eye track activity recognition systems that influence modern design. Students will learn and apply Gestalt theory to design problems and expand their visual lexicon. Photo history will be brought into context with the larger visual narrative and explore how light, shape, form and composition help communicate complex thought and emotion. Guest lecturers will frequent the class giving insight into how visual language is used to communicate and report beyond words."}], "lmod": "2/6/17 6:36 PM (CT)", "subject": "IMC"}]
