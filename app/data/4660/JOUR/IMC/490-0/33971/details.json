Students will explore many of the issues that arise in building such models, e.g., exploratory vs. confirmatory studies, inductive vs. deductive reasoning, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, nonlinearity, interactions, model selection, regularization, bias-variance tradeoff, extrapolation, and the curse of dimensionality. The course will help students understand how and why different methods work, which methods are well-suited for certain situations, and the extent of the conclusions that can be drawn from various models."}], "lmod": "2/9/17 6:36 PM (CT)", "subject": "IMC"}]
