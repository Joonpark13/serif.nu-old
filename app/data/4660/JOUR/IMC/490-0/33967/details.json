It is comprised of category management, retail display, personal selling, packaging, promotion, research and marketing brought together in retailer-specific programs designed to fit the mutual interests of brands and retailers. Students learn to deal with the sometimes conflicting interests of retailers and manufacturers in their efforts to influence their shared target consumers. Students identify best practices for executing and measuring the wide variety of in-store, near-store and online tactics and put these practices into use through a course-long shopper marketing project for a sponsoring company."}], "lmod": "2/16/17 6:37 PM (CT)", "subject": "IMC"}]
