[{"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "This course will provide students with a comprehensive overview of HD video production, specifically geared towards producing short documentaries that tell human stories. Emphasis is put on the use of character, conflict, drama and surprise in telling these documentary stories. We will also look at different documentary styles and how narrative structures like story arcs are implemented. Students will learn documentary production with a journalism focus: reporting, camera technique, lighting, and sound recording in the field. Students will create a seven-ten minute documentary project in a group of three. They will research and write a treatment, cast charismatic characters, get signed releases, shoot and edit the film. Documentaries created in this course have gone on to win National College Emmys, Chicago College Emmys and premiere at film festivals like Cannes and Tribeca.", "name": "Documentary", "section": "20", "location": "McCormick Foundation Ctr 4115", "topic": "", "course": "368-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 1:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/JOUR/JOUR/368-0/33204", "instructor": ["Brent E Huffman"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "33204", "subject": "JOUR"}]
