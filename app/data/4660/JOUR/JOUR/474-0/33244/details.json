From cardiologists to chief security officers to chefs, professionals and industry decision-makers use these media to gain the highly specific knowledge that can inform and improve their work. B2B reporters, editors and publishers become or collaborate with experts and specialists, and often report targeted information well before the general media does. While B2B operations can be lean, they reward cross-media expertise at competitive salaries and offer smaller pyramids to the top of the masthead.<br/><br/>You'll learn about B2B media through lectures, examining award-winning stories and formats, and teamwork on a real-world problem. This Spring's project will involve making content recommendations for three media-oriented titles."}], "lmod": "2/6/17 8:35 AM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
