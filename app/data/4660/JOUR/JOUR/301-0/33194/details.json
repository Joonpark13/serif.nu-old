Why is Chicago one of the most popular tourist destinations? What makes it attractive to young urban professionals? But there are other questions as well that deal with poverty, race and social discrimination and gang violence.?Social?Change and Urban Dynamics?is designed to look more deeply into these questions and more by examining two Chicago neighborhoods, one north, one south; one that has undergone tremendous social and economic change in little more than a decade, and another that is just on the verge of neighborhood revitalization but isn't there quite yet. What is involved in transforming a community from one that is low-income to high income? What are the positives and negatives of gentrification? In both teamed and individual research, this class will look at the economics, sociology and humanity of changing neighborhoods, using Chicago, one of the most fascinating cities in the world, as a primary source."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Sophomore Standing"}], "lmod": "2/7/17 6:37 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
