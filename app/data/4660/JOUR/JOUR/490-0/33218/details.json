The Lab places students together on teams to work on an important problem for the future of media, rapidly moving beyond conversation and hypothesis to well-reasoned action during the quarter. Our process combines user and audience research, design thinking, critical and analytical work, iterative building, storytelling, new technology, and a healthy dose of experimentation?often within the confines of a single, specific problem. Projects are open by application. Spring 2017 includes projects on virtual reality, 3D photography, audience engagement, environmental reporting using sensors to measure air quality, and data explorations. Partners include ProPublica and Public Good Software. Full project details and application available at knightlab.com/class."}], "lmod": "2/21/17 6:38 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
