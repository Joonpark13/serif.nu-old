From the way we present complex data on mobile screens, to building out immersive 360-degree environments for our audiences to explore, we must consider each technology carefully and assess what it brings to the story. Working with Knight Lab techniques and in the Device Lab, students in Applied Technology in Journalism will explore how to report and present stories using various technologies?from exploring programming languages such as JavaScript to emergent presentations such as VR (Virtual Reality) or VUI (voice user interfaces). Students will learn the basics of interactive storytelling through an in-depth study of nonlinear narrative structure, while learning to build their own stories during hands-on story-development labs."}], "lmod": "2/7/17 6:37 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
