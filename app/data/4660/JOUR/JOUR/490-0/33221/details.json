Students also join science research facilities at CERN, in Munich and New Zealand and at other locations. This two-credit capstone course begins with seminars on field reporting strategies and on building narrative and visual stories from field experiences, sources and data. We also pitch stories in advance to major media partners prior to your departure. You file blogs, photos and stories for publication from the field. Once you return, you produce major in-depth narrative stories with photos and graphics and/or multimedia stories, working closely with your instructor. Students choosing to embed at a Washington D.C. site such as NIH can complete story production in D.C. or return to Chicago. We have some funding for embedded reporting to help offset travel expenses."}], "lmod": "2/16/17 6:37 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
