Families of students from a rural province in China spend life savings on sending children to U.S. colleges, and top communist officials send their kids to Ivy League schools. Along with embracing expanded opportunities, some students struggle with isolation, racism and a fundamental change in identity and career expectations. At one Midwestern university, Chinese students have created a Mandarin sports network and an underground network of businesses - homemade dumplings, Chinese products and services.

Much of our reporting will be focused on universities in Illinois, but we will also report on campuses nationwide. Participants in our class will learn about and practice cross-cultural and multi-lingual (English and Chinese dialects) interviewing (with and without translators) and produce multimedia stories. We also will compare and contrast the interests and needs of global audiences, and discuss how different people engage with storytelling in distinct languages and media. Our class will develop pitches and stories in English and Mandarin to be considered for publication by editors from global media outlets, including the New York Times in Mandarin.<br/><br/>Knowledge of a Chinese language is not required, though students who understand and speak Mandarin and Cantonese are encouraged to participate. Some travel will be funded through a Northwestern University innovation grant."}], "lmod": "2/8/17 6:37 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
