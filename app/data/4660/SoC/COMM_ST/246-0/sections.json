This is true on a personal, intimate level in the way patients and caregivers interact in the examination room and how families communicate at home. It is also true on an organization level; policies and community relations affect the way that health care is provided and the way that people feel about that care. It is also evident in media campaigns that seek to educate people about health. The importance of health communication is extraordinary, but so are the challenges. People who understand communication are uniquely positioned to solve health related problems, and their services are increasingly in demand. Indeed, health communication specialists work (a) in hospital education departments, teaching medical professionals to communicate more effectively; (b) in public relations, marketing, and human resource departments; (c) in patient satisfaction and patient advocacy programs; (d) in health care administration; (e) in media organizations covering health issues; (f) in nonprofit organizations; and (g) in organizations that educate the public and support public policy and research. This course is designed to familiarize you with the field of health communication. Specifically, through readings, in-class lecture, discussion, assignments, and experiential activities, we will explore the theory, research, and skills associated with communicating in various health contexts. This will include communication among providers, family caregivers, patients, healthcare organizations, and in mediated messages in the marketing and promotion of health information and the politics of health care. By taking this course, you will become a more mindful, educated, and effective health communicator.", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Intro to Health Communication", "title": "SoC COMM_ST 246-0-20 Intro to Health Communication", "lmod": "2/24/17 6:39 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Kimberly Brook Pusateri", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "246-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Communication is inextricably intertwined with issues of health and medicine.
