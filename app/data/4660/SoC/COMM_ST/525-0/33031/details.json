Given the complexity of such a task, the course aims not for theoretical or methodological mastery, but seeks to begin the process of mapping relevant traditions and literatures that have influenced recent attempts to connect rhetoric and culture. The course will survey some of the concepts of &quot;culture&quot; that have been used to describe and analyze the constitution and consequences of communicative behavior in the past and survey some of the most influential work that has been based upon such conceptualizations."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "No textbook"}], "lmod": "2/16/17 6:38 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
