We will question the novelty of digital media by acknowledging both its limitations and its additional affordances. By historically situating digital media, we will trouble the notion of newness and investigate past media evolutions (as it relates to print, radio, and television) in order to complicate understandings of the present digital landscape. Using this lens, students will learn how to produce a 20-page research paper that demonstrates their writing, research, and critical thinking skills."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "The Craft of Research"}], "lmod": "2/7/17 6:37 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
