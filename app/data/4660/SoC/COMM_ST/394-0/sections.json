[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This section provides a general introduction to theory and research concerning health-related persuasion, especially in the context of health communication campaigns. The course covers leading theoretical frameworks that have guided health persuasion research and practice (e.g., the transtheoretical model) and research concerning health communication campaigns (campaign planning, execution, and evaluation). Students will complete a substantial research paper and contribute to class discussion of readings.", "name": "Communication Studies Research Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G31", "topic": "Persuasion in Health Contexts", "course": "394-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 3:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/COMM_ST/394-0/33041", "instructor": ["Daniel James O'Keefe"], "class_attributes": "Undergraduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "33041", "subject": "COMM_ST"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "The proliferation of information and communication technologies (e.g., social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter) has connected people at an unprecedented level. For example, \"six degrees of separation\" (a.k.a. small world phenomena) suggests that individuals can be connected with any other individuals via six intermediaries. However, recent research suggests that individuals on Facebook can be connected via about four intermediaries. Social networks play an important role in our understanding of a wide array of human phenomena, including interpersonal interaction, organizational communication, political campaigns, public health, and social movement. Trends suggest that new networked forms of self-organizing are emerging and evolving. This course will introduce theories for analyzing and understanding how social actors (e.g., individuals, organizations, and even texts) are connected via social networks. We will review scholarship on social networks across a wide array of disciplines in order to gain insight into their structures and dynamics. We will examine how psychological, cognitive, economic, social, cultural, political, and technological factors influence our networked society. In addition, we will critically evaluate the impact of social networks on relationships, activism, management, marketing, politics, and media. Topics of this course include the antecedents (the \"why\" question), processes (the \"how\" question), and outcomes (the \"what\" question) of social networks in a variety of fields. Students will read classic and cutting edge articles and book chapters about these topics and discuss their implications. In addition, through weekly writing exercises culminating in a final research paper (15 - 20 pages) at the end of the quarter, students will learn to articulate and defend a position about the role of social networks in the networked age. In service of this goal, this class will provide an overview of the mechanics of writing a research paper. Topics covered will include how to locate and use academic source material, how to make and defend claims, how to incorporate peer reviews, and how to organize a research paper.", "name": "Communication Studies Research Seminar", "section": "21", "location": "Parkes Hall 213", "topic": "Social Networks and Society", "course": "394-0", "meeting_time": ["We 3:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/COMM_ST/394-0/33042", "instructor": ["Jiawei   Fu"], "class_attributes": "Department Majors Only<br/><br/>Juniors/Seniors Only<br/><br/>", "id": "33042", "subject": "COMM_ST"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Smartphone apps are widely designed and used to engage people in positive behavioral changes in recent years, ranging from weight loss, healthy diet and exercise to meditation practice and eco-friendly behaviors.
