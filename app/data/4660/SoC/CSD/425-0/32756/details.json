Specifically students will become familiar with the following clinical protocols: auditory brainstem responses including cABR, auditory steady-state responses, middle latency responses and the cortical P300 response. Students will also cover the central auditory system, auditory neurodevelopment, test analysis and interpretation, consideration of the impact of hearing aids and cochlear implants on speech and music perception, and how to convey diagnostic/intervention information to patients and families."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "The only undergrads that will be allowed to register are CSD juniors and seniors if they have taken CSD 310/410."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Students will be assessed on lab reports, other clinically-based written reports and presentations, a midterm, a final, and weekly assignments.<br/>The Weekly Assignment:<br/>The weekly responses will be due every Tuesday before class.

If it is clear that you have grasped a major concept from the lectures and a major concept from the readings, engaged in some form of critical thinking regarding these concepts, and have sufficiently communicated this information, you will get all 6 points.
