[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Through lecture-based classes and hands-on, clinically-focused laboratory assignments, students will learn how to evaluate the auditory system for hearing loss, retrocochlear disorders and auditory processing disorders using the appropriate electrophysiological test(s). Specifically students will become familiar with the following clinical protocols: auditory brainstem responses including cABR, auditory steady-state responses, middle latency responses and the cortical P300 response. Students will also cover the central auditory system, auditory neurodevelopment, test analysis and interpretation, consideration of the impact of hearing aids and cochlear implants on speech and music perception, and how to convey diagnostic/intervention information to patients and families.", "name": "Electrophysiology of the Human Auditory System", "section": "20", "location": "Frances Searle Building 2370", "topic": "", "course": "425-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/CSD/425-0/32756", "instructor": ["Jason Tait Sanchez"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "32756", "subject": "CSD"}]
