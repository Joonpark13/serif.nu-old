[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Students will acquire knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of normal swallowing and pathophysiology of swallowing impairment (dysphagia) across the age spectrum. Students will acquire fundamental skills in swallowing screening, clinical evaluation and radiographic swallowing assessment. They will be introduced to other instrumental assessment methods including flexible fiberoptic nasendoscopy, electromyography, manometry and respiratory-swallow recordings. Students will learn and apply evidence based and physiologically targeted interventions and critically evaluate the dysphagia literature. They will demonstrate competency in the selection of swallowing assessment and treatment methods based on the condition of the patient, nature of impairment and clinical question. Synthesis of acquired knowledge, skills and clinical decision making will be assessed through the development of management plans in special patient populations with dysphagia. Formulation of treatment goals with consideration of ethical and cultural issues will be integrated into case based learning. Professional dysphagia practice issues, resources and research opportunities will be introduced.", "name": "Swallow Physiology and Pathology", "section": "20", "location": "Frances Searle Building 1441", "topic": "", "course": "497-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/CSD/497-0/32766", "instructor": ["Bonnie Jean Martin"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "32766", "subject": "CSD"}]
