Describe respiration, phonation, resonance and articulation as related to modulation of voice. Describe neurophysiology of respiration, phonation and resonance.

(ASHA III-C)<br/>Identify techniques for prevention of voice disorders and promotion of vocal wellness (vocal hygiene, avoiding phonotrauma) in varied clinical, educational and corporate settings. Identify evidence-based treatment approaches and outcomes to voice disorders: behavioral, medical (including pharmacological), surgical, and combination strategies.

In case of an emergency or of a known absence, please email or call Mr. Waller in advance. Punctuality is expected!<br/>Exams (50 points for each): There will be a mid-quarter and final exam. The instructor will review the material, which will be tested prior to the examinations.<br/>Written article review (25 pts.): You will read a current research article (i.e., report on a study) focused on assessment or intervention and provide a two page summary and critique. This can cover anything related to voice. Summarize the article including the following information: purpose, subjects, method, results, and conclusions. Also, how the information relates to class (lectures/discussions) and/or your potential role as a speech pathologist.<br/>Guest speaker report (25 pts.): You will write a 3 to 4 page report summarizing the topics presented by our guest speakers. <br/>Group presentation (100 pts.): Each student will participate in a group presentation and will present to the class. The professor will assign each group a therapy technique/program for the student groups to present. Presentations should include which subset of voice disorders their therapy technique is applicable, long term and short term goals, sample materials, a presentation handout for the rest of the students and DEMONSTRATION of techniques. <br/>Lab (50 pts.): During available hours, use the computerized speech lab to complete a vocal profile of a classmate's voice. The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with the technology. The professor will provide you with written instructions for how to run this program and will list the necessary measurements you should obtain. In your report, you should include a summary of your classmate's vocal health/demands, talkativeness/loudness rating, perceptual findings (quality of voice, loudness level, pitch, breath support, swelling tests, vocal attack) and finally their acoustic findings."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Aronson, A.E., &amp; Bless, D.M.
