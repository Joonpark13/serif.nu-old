Understand normal speech sound acquisition.<br/>2. Demonstrate an understanding of assessment procedures and analytic tools for performing diagnostic procedures related to developmental speech sound disorders. <br/>3. Develop intervention plans to address developmental speech sound disorders with consideration of phonetic versus phonemic approaches, treatment efficacy, motor learning principles, as well as other various treatment approaches. <br/> <br/>-<br/>Teaching Method: <br/> <br/>The course will include lectures and lab activities. <br/> <br/>-<br/>Evaluation Method: <br/> <br/>Grades will be based on lab activities and three in-class exams. <br/> <br/>-<br/>Class Materials (Required): <br/> Bauman-Waengler, J.
