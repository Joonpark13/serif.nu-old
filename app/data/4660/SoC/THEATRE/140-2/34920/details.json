In this course we will investigate how theatre can build connections between, across, and within communities. We will examine how issues of privilege and oppression inform community-based theatres in the United States, such as Cornerstone Theater, Albany Park Youth Theatre Project, and Theatre of the Oppressed NYC. By the end of the course you will be able to articulate how these companies and others engage the traditions they inherit, and argue for theatre's role in communities that it represents and engages. Like all Theatre 140-2 courses, this class introduces students to university-level research-paper writing that incorporates performance analysis and secondary sources. This course mixes lectures, discussion, and writing to explore methods for theatre history performance critique."}], "lmod": "2/20/17 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
