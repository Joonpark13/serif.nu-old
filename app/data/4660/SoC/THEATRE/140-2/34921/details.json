By considering the different associations and functions of satire across theatre communities, we come to consider the role of satire in theatre and performance today. Does Longinus linger in late-night? Is Hamilton satire? What are the racial and gender politics of different theories of satire? What are the legacies of theatrical satire on the big and small screen today? We will supplement readings by listening to audio recordings of stand-up and sketch, watching late-night TV shows, and reading and seeing plays. We will also take advantage of all the rich comic and satiric offerings that Chicago has to offer, with an outing to a Chicago comedy event. Like all Theatre 140-2 courses, this class introduces students to university-level research-paper writing that incorporates performance analysis and secondary sources. This course mixes lectures, discussion, and writing to explore methods for theatre history performance critique."}], "lmod": "2/19/17 6:41 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
