[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "\"This class will examine the representation of gender norms in Anglophone theatre from the early twentieth century to the present day. We will study such writers as Alice Childress, Angelina Weld Grimk\u00e9, Susan Glaspell, Zona Gale, Sophie Treadwell, and Maria Irene Fornes. As we read these dramatic texts, we will also read classic texts of feminist theory and criticism, written at the same time as the plays we will be reading, by such writers as Simone De Beauvoir, Juliet Mitchell, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous, Luce Irigaray, and Michael Kimmel. In addition, we will compare these texts to the representation of gender norms in both popular and more avant-garde films of the time. Throughout the class, our view will be on understanding both the continuities and the changes in the conceptions and the performance of gender, both on the stage and in everyday life.<br/><br/>Students will have homework assignments, reading quizzes, two 3-4 page essays, and one 8-10 page essay.<br/>\"", "name": "Special Topics in History", "section": "20", "location": "Wirtz 240 Seminar Room 2", "topic": "Staging Gender in 20th Century American Drama", "course": "366-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/THEATRE/366-0/34959", "instructor": ["Charles C Harmon"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34959", "subject": "THEATRE"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course studies contemporary African plays and performances, each within a distinct cultural, political, and economic context.

Designed to provoke new collaborations across creative disciplines, the workshops invented new possibilities for the integration of art, architecture, and dance. As an alternative to set choreography, Anna Halprin developed unique methods of dance scoring. Combining task-based improvisation structures and environmental exploration, her performance works initiated a style for avant-garde multimedia theatre. Anna's dances have defied obscenity laws, confronted race relations, upended theatrical traditions, and redefined dance itself. This course will examine the history, theory, and practice of the Halprins' workshop models. Additionally, the class will engage Anna Halprin's work in expressive arts. Through an exploration and analysis of the physical body's connection to expressivity, we will undertake a creative practice that investigates metaphoric relationships between emotion, imagination, community, and life experience.", "name": "Special Topics in History", "section": "22", "location": "Wirtz Center BERGEN", "topic": "Anna Halprin Life/Art Workshop", "course": "366-0", "meeting_time": ["Fr 9:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/THEATRE/366-0/34961", "instructor": ["Elliot Gordon Mercer"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34961", "subject": "THEATRE"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Although the postmodern, avant-garde, and contemporary are widely perceived as genres emerging from and residing within the white West, artists of color outside of Euro-America are creating some of the most fascinating and complex work today.

We will analyze their choreography through postcolonial and feminist perspectives in order to attend to the structural challenges that the artists face in the aftermath of colonialism and ongoing increasing global capitalism.
