[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "\"This class will examine the representation of gender norms in Anglophone theatre from the early twentieth century to the present day. We will study such writers as Alice Childress, Angelina Weld Grimk\u00e9, Susan Glaspell, Zona Gale, Sophie Treadwell, and Maria Irene Fornes. As we read these dramatic texts, we will also read classic texts of feminist theory and criticism, written at the same time as the plays we will be reading, by such writers as Simone De Beauvoir, Juliet Mitchell, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous, Luce Irigaray, and Michael Kimmel. In addition, we will compare these texts to the representation of gender norms in both popular and more avant-garde films of the time. Throughout the class, our view will be on understanding both the continuities and the changes in the conceptions and the performance of gender, both on the stage and in everyday life.<br/><br/>Students will have homework assignments, reading quizzes, two 3-4 page essays, and one 8-10 page essay.<br/>\"", "name": "Special Topics in History", "section": "20", "location": "Wirtz 240 Seminar Room 2", "topic": "Staging Gender in 20th Century American Drama", "course": "366-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/THEATRE/366-0/34959", "instructor": ["Charles C Harmon"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34959", "subject": "THEATRE"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course studies contemporary African plays and performances, each within a distinct cultural, political, and economic context.

We will analyze their choreography through postcolonial and feminist perspectives in order to attend to the structural challenges that the artists face in the aftermath of colonialism and ongoing increasing global capitalism. The course asks: as contemporary dance is practiced in multiple sites across the world, what coheres in the category \"contemporary dance\"?
