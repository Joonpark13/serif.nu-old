Designed to provoke new collaborations across creative disciplines, the workshops invented new possibilities for the integration of art, architecture, and dance. As an alternative to set choreography, Anna Halprin developed unique methods of dance scoring. Combining task-based improvisation structures and environmental exploration, her performance works initiated a style for avant-garde multimedia theatre. Anna's dances have defied obscenity laws, confronted race relations, upended theatrical traditions, and redefined dance itself. This course will examine the history, theory, and practice of the Halprins' workshop models. Additionally, the class will engage Anna Halprin's work in expressive arts. Through an exploration and analysis of the physical body's connection to expressivity, we will undertake a creative practice that investigates metaphoric relationships between emotion, imagination, community, and life experience."}], "lmod": "2/20/17 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
