We will study such writers as Alice Childress, Angelina Weld Grimk\u00e9, Susan Glaspell, Zona Gale, Sophie Treadwell, and Maria Irene Fornes. As we read these dramatic texts, we will also read classic texts of feminist theory and criticism, written at the same time as the plays we will be reading, by such writers as Simone De Beauvoir, Juliet Mitchell, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous, Luce Irigaray, and Michael Kimmel. In addition, we will compare these texts to the representation of gender norms in both popular and more avant-garde films of the time. Throughout the class, our view will be on understanding both the continuities and the changes in the conceptions and the performance of gender, both on the stage and in everyday life.<br/><br/>Students will have homework assignments, reading quizzes, two 3-4 page essays, and one 8-10 page essay.<br/>&quot;"}], "lmod": "2/20/17 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
