We will examine Death and the King's Horseman (Nigeria) by Wole Soyinka, Anowa (Ghana) by Ama Ata Aidoo, Amajuba (South Africa) by Yael Farber,The Rise and Shine of Camrade Fiasco (Zimbabwe) by Andrew Whaley, and The Other War (Eritrea) by Alemseged Tesfai. In addition to investigating these five plays within their greater contexts, students will be exposed to non-text based performance work in their specific contexts and contemporary issues in theatre within the African and international context. As a final project, students will choose a play or performance originating on the African continent for in-depth analysis and engagement, resulting in a final presentation and paper."}], "lmod": "2/6/17 8:37 AM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
