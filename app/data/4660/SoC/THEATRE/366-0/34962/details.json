Through readings, viewings, and dance practice, this course encounters a handful of contemporary choreographers from sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We will analyze their choreography through postcolonial and feminist perspectives in order to attend to the structural challenges that the artists face in the aftermath of colonialism and ongoing increasing global capitalism. The course asks: as contemporary dance is practiced in multiple sites across the world, what coheres in the category &quot;contemporary dance&quot;? This guiding question will be enriched by themes including transnational circulation, choreographies of anti-colonial resistance, global feminisms, national identity, state violence, and intercultural collaboration."}], "lmod": "2/8/17 6:38 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
