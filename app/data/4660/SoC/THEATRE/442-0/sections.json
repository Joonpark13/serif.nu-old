MFA Directing students in 21st Century Performance Texts will be expected to read 1-2 new pieces of writing each week, respond to these texts with assigned weekly exercises (in text or other artistic medium) and synthesize ideas into a final project. This class posits that directors need a personal reflection process prior to the practical prepping for production. We will explore preparation of a text refracted through other artistic forms. The class will be run as a creative workshop, so we will investigate these texts, narrative strategies and temporal/spatial/design ideas from a director's perspective, focusing on the earliest stage of building relationship to text through mapping strategies. Throughout the quarter, we will explore Kenneth Burke's philosophical construction of the relationship between THE CONTAINER and THE THING CONTAINED. Also we will cover the concepts that questions beget questions and lists beget lists, multiplicity of one vs two vs three, density of production, beginnings, and capturing our own process through a personal tool of passionate inquiry.", "name": "Theatre Practice", "section": "21", "location": "Fisk Hall 115", "topic": "Master Class: 21st Century Plays", "course": "442-0", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/THEATRE/442-0/34989", "instructor": ["Bonnie S Metzgar"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34989", "subject": "THEATRE"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "Theatre Practice", "section": "22", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "442-0", "meeting_time": ["TBA"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/THEATRE/442-0/34990", "instructor": [""], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34990", "subject": "THEATRE"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "Theatre Practice", "section": "24", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "442-0", "meeting_time": ["TBA"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/THEATRE/442-0/34991", "instructor": [""], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "34991", "subject": "THEATRE"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "Theatre Practice", "section": "25", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "442-0", "meeting_time": ["TBA"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/THEATRE/442-0/34992", "instructor": [""], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "34992", "subject": "THEATRE"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "Theatre Practice", "section": "27", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "442-0", "meeting_time": ["TBA"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/THEATRE/442-0/34993", "instructor": [""], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "34993", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
