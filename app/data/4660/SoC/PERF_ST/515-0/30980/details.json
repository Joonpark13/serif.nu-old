This seminar integrates experiential learning with readings and discussions to develop ethnographic skills in interpreting what John Blacking famously called &quot;humanly organized sound.&quot; We will engage with case studies that analyze field recordings, oral histories, sound archives, listening practices, and commodified sounds. We ask how sonic phenomena can be used to address key anthropological issues, including but not limited to sensory studies, space and place, historical ethnography, political economy, and the sonic relations of bodies and technologies. Students will be asked to design and conduct an ethnographic project that will be workshopped over the course of the term."}], "lmod": "2/20/17 6:38 PM (CT)", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
