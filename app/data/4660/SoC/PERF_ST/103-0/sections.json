[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "<br/>Overview of class<br/> <br/>The course studies the performance of poetry, short fiction, and non-fiction. It explores how performance helps the performer and audience to understand a text; it considers in what ways a performance can \"match\" a written text; and it examines the techniques of performance. Students write three critical papers and give three live, graded performances. There are some quizzes and workshops. The class is neither an acting class nor an English class, but it draws on practices fundamental to both. Much of class time will be devoted to performance of texts and rigorous critical discussion of the performances and the works on which they are based. Consequently, attendance is mandatory. It examines the role of the audience in the critical reception of the text. The course is designed for both students with little prior performance experience and those with considerable theatrical experience.<br/><br/>It is an excellent course for students to take who want to become excellent communicators; it hones your professional skills and gives you the poise and confidence to excel in the \"real world.\"", "name": "Analysis & Performance of Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L06", "topic": "", "course": "103-0", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeTh 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/PERF_ST/103-0/30963", "instructor": ["Carol Simpson   Stern"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "30963", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
