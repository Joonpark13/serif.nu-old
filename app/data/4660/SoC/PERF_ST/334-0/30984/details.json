This is the question the class will explore throughout the course.<br/><br/>Key perspectives from various artists, activists, and scholars on human rights and activism are examined through class discussion and debate. As we read and engage these various texts our knowledge and feelings about them will culminate in a range of collaborative performances: improvisation, symbolic movement, narrative, poetic texts, digital imagery &amp; sound.<br/><br/>This is a performance-centered class that draws on central debates in the field of rights and activism. It is preferred, but it is not required that you have any performance experience. Performances will emerge collaboratively and generously in each class session. All that is required is that you come to class prepared from the assigned readings and with an open mind toward embodied, interactive, and experiential learning in the service of human rights and activism."}], "lmod": "2/9/17 6:38 PM (CT)", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
