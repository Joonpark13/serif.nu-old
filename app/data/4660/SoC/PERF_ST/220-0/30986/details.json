Exploring the interdisciplinary field of sound studies, we engage with sound as sensory mode, cultural expression, creative practice, and technology. We will discuss core texts within sound studies and relate these to a broad range of case studies including avant-garde practices, protest cultures, consumerism, urban life, and popular culture. Our key questions include: how does sound mediate identity formation with regard to race, gender, religion, and class? What constitutes conditions of hearing and listening in the modern era, and, how might mediated sound facilitate new encounters with the lived environment, our bodies, or with history? In what ways do publics emerge through the transnational circulation of sound and conversely, how are publics contested through listening practices? Students will be able to describe, contrast, and analyze sound cultures over a wide geographical and chronological range. Students will gain skills in close listening, or the critical assessment of sound objects, technology, and sensory experience, and apply these to media studies, performance studies, and related fields of critical inquiry."}], "lmod": "2/7/17 6:38 PM (CT)", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
