Using &quot;Blacktino&quot; as a framing device, the course will highlight how these artists index the specificities of black and brown social and political relations, while also waging a broader queer-of-color critique of institutionalized racism and homophobia. Students will engage these artitsts' work on various levels, including textual analysis, embodied experience, critical reception, and site-specific engagement.<br/><br/>*This class includes a mandatory experimental learning trip to New York City (May 26-29, 2017).
