The class will view and analyze a range of representative films with accompanied readings (e.g. Julie Dash's Daughters of the Dust, Jean Luc Godard's Hail Mary, Luis Bunuel's Un Chien Andalou, Lindsay Anderson's The White Bus, Leos Carax's Holy Motors, Michael Haneke's Code Unknown, Jane Campion's Peel, Ingmar Bergman's Persona, Lynne Ramsay's Small Deaths, Apichatpong Weerasethakul's Tropical Malady, Barry Jenkin's Moonlight, et al). Students will then write and create final short film projects positing their own narrative strategies working either as individuals or in pairs. <br/><br/>Warning: Please research the list of sample films before taking the class. Most films screened are counter-cultural works which were designed to provoke a strong emotional response. Many contain what might be for some sensitive viewers disturbing depictions of violence and sexual content. Most are chosen because they are recognized by the field as exceptional works for narrative experimentation. You are encouraged to respond and critique each filmmaker's approach to discover more about your personal voice as an artist.<br/><br/>Evaluation Method<br/><br/>Attendance/discussion participation, one short written director's manifesto, one short script and final completed short film.<br/><br/>Registration Requirements<br/><br/>RTVF 190<br/><br/>Class Materials (Required)<br/><br/>Alternative Scriptwriting: Beyond the Hollywood Formula by Ken Dancyger and Jeff Rush, Focal Press, ISBN-13 978-0240522463 Edition <br/><br/>Media production expendables necessary for completion of dramatic or documentary project, should include hard drive for your media.
