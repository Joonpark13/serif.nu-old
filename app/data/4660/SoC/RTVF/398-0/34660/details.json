We will discuss audience engagement, distribution, and outlets (online, broadcast, and brick-and-mortar) and interview programmers, who work for festivals, movie theaters, micro cinemas, and cinematheques. Students will come away with insights about festival strategy for their own films and a solid understanding of the distribution and exhibition phase, allowing them to navigate that landscape more successfully as mediamakers and potentially as programmers. In addition to the class group project, students will also develop an individual proposal for an event or series that can encompass a wide range of work (audio, new film/video, or even archival material).<br/> <br/>Students will leave the course with a portfolio that includes their interview with a programmer, a written proposals for an event or series, and in-depth documentation of a successfully realized public event that they co-produced.<br/> <br/>Students will be evaluated based on individual assignments and the culminating group project; as well as attendance and class participation.<br/> <br/>Required class materials will include a course packet or book (TBA), not to exceed $50."}], "lmod": "2/19/17 6:41 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
