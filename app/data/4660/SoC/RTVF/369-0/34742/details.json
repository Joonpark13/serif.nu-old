Through screenings of work by such fiction narrative directors as Ford, Kurasowa, Campion, and Cuaron, the class will introduce distinct strategies for covering action and blocking performers in relation to both camera movement and editorial design. Students will practice at staging for long-take and fast-cutting, for still and moving camera, tripod, dolly, and handheld work. If film school were Hogwarts, this course would be &quot;Defense Against the Dark Arts,&quot; emphasizing directorial and performance skills in production to control pacing and dramatic emphasis, as well as to guide audience attention through the scene work itself, in the tradition of classical studio direction and performance that determined editing &quot;in camera&quot; to most directly communicate with the audience and protect against post-production meddling by studio heads and marketing departments.<br/> <br/>Learning objectives: students will: demonstrate understanding and ability to execute a range of approaches to blocking, positioning camera, and planning editing; put scene analysis into practice through arrangement and movement of performers; engaging in practical critique of visual storytelling strategies, aesthetics, and emotional engagement<br/> <br/>Evaluation method: Class participation; in-class presentations on staging and editorial strategies of feature films shown for class; supervised in-class exercises; frequent group shooting projects outside class to practice strategies of staging, shooting, and editing drama; all students will act in these projects, and the course will count as an Acting for Screen module elective.<br/> <br/>Class Materials: Film Directing: Cinematic Motion 2nd Edition by Steven D.
