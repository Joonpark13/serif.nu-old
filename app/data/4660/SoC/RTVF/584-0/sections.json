[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "RTVF 584: Media and Everyday Life <br/>Prof. Lynn Spigel <br/><br/>This course explores media in the context of theories of everyday life. We'll trace theories of everyday life as they emerge in the 20th Century, especially in the post-WWII period through the present. We'll explore how the notion of the \"everyday\" became a subject of both political and scholarly concern, and how theories of the everyday are particularly relevant for understanding media culture. The course focuses on the ways in which media, from television to digital, have come to define everyday experience in modern/post-industrial culture. We'll place special emphasis on way media have saturated the built environment, material objects, and social relations in everyday life. Readings will offer interdisciplinary perspectives. Film and TV Screenings will be discussed weekly (some screened in class, some on your own). Evaluation based on short essays, a final research paper, oral presentations, and discussion.", "name": "Research Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "Annie May Swift Hall 109", "topic": "Media & Theories of Everyday Life", "course": "584-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 10:00AM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/RTVF/584-0/34705", "instructor": ["Lynn B Spigel"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34705", "subject": "RTVF"}]
