It is also part of your professionalization training. As such, it involves a series of professionalization classes, workshops, and talks on conference presentation, job search, developing research questions, and academic writing and publication, some of which will also be open to all Screen Cultures graduate students and faculty. In addition, the student will present and critically analyze and discuss the drafts of each other's prospectuses throughout the term, resulting in a relatively polished prospectus by each student."}], "lmod": "2/16/17 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
