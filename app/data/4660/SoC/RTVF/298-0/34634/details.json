We will demystify these ubiquitous technologies by investigating the specific political, economic, and cultural factors that have shaped their development and use over course of the 20th and 21st centuries. Highlighting how geopolitical forces, as well as the social categories of race, gender, and class have molded the design, applications, and social meanings of computers, we will learn that the significance of digital media is as rooted in social context as in technological change. <br/> <br/>Topics include: the origins of modern computers in wartime engineering; the social history of the Internet and networks; the interaction of computer technology with global capitalism and the culture of work; and the political significance of video games, social media, open source software, and hacker culture. <br/><br/>Learning Objectives:<br/>Hone research and writing skills while exploring the history and politics of ubiquitous digital technologies.<br/><br/>Evaluation Methods:<br/>Class Participation; Reading Responses; Discussion Leader; Research Assignment; 10 page paper<br/><br/>Class Notes:<br/>We will screen a relevant film in class the first meeting of each week.
