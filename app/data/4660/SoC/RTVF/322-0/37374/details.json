This class considers American romantic comedy films from the 1930s to the early 2000s with particular consideration of: 1) mistaken identities, reversals, and masquerades and 2) the norms, normative boundaries, and pliability of the genre, especially when it comes to race and sexuality. Many of the films we will see are based on confusions about who is whom, based on accidental misunderstanding, willful deceptions, or unruliness. Films include: My Man Godfrey, Bringing Up Baby, Some Like It Hot, Pillow Talk, You've Got Mail, Bringing Down the House, The Wedding Banquet, among others.<br/><br/>Students will be encouraged to research other aspects/variants/formulas of romantic comedy films (and other films) as an integral part of their class work. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Evaluation method: \u00a0\u00a0Class participation, short writing assignments in response to class screenings and/or readings; research and writing assignments building toward a final research project.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Class materials: \u00a0Reading packet/students will need access to films (of their own choosing), based on their research project topic."}], "lmod": "2/14/17 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
