With an emphasis on the actor/director relationship, it will address practices for creating and portraying characters as well as the more technical concerns of how actors place themselves in relationship to the camera for the most effective appearance onscreen. Students in this course will perform in (and, in some cases, direct) a number of exercises to build acting skills in front of the camera, in projects - both in-class and out-of-class - designed to focus on cinematic storytelling achieved primarily through performance rather than primarily through directorial technique, cinematography, editing, and sound design. PREREQUISITES: RTVF 190 and either TH 143-0 or TH 243-1. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: Students will develop a working knowledge of film acting techniques, on-set protocol, as well as preliminary industry tips.
