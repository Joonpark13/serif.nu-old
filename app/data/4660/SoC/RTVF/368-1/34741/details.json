With an emphasis on the actor/director relationship, it will address practices for creating and portraying characters as well as the more technical concerns of how actors place themselves in relationship to the camera for the most effective appearance onscreen. Students in this course will perform in (and, in some cases, direct) a number of exercises to build acting skills in front of the camera, in projects - both in-class and out-of-class - designed to focus on cinematic storytelling achieved primarily through performance rather than primarily through directorial technique, cinematography, editing, and sound design.<br/><br/>LEARNING OBJECTIVES: Students will develop a working knowledge of film acting techniques, on-set protocol, as well as preliminary industry tips.<br/><br/>TEACHING METHOD: in-class workshops and scenes, out-of-class student-directed filmed projects<br/><br/>EVALUATION METHOD: Students will be evaluated on class participation and individual progress in performance."}], "lmod": "2/21/17 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
