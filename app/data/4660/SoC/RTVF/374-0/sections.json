Students will collaborate on a single science fiction short film project to be shot over the course of the quarter.

We will incorporate old-school effects with set-building, miniatures, models, mirrors, and forced perspective, as well as cutting-edge motion control, virtual camera, some basic 3D animation, green screen and compositing. The course requires a substantial time investment on the part of the students, including at least two weekend days for shooting, and a considerable amount of time outside of class working on shots, building models, or doing post-production.
