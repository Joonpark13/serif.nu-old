Students will collaborate on a single science fiction short film project to be shot over the course of the quarter. The project will involve multiple visual effects in both production and post production ranging from the most simple in-camera effects to sophisticated 5-axis motion-control operations. We will incorporate old-school effects with set-building, miniatures, models, mirrors, and forced perspective, as well as cutting-edge motion control, virtual camera, some basic 3D animation, green screen and compositing. The course requires a substantial time investment on the part of the students, including at least two weekend days for shooting, and a considerable amount of time outside of class working on shots, building models, or doing post-production. The result is a really fantastic collaboration and a completed film. Students will be evaluated on quality of work, participation, and demonstrated mastery of techniques.
