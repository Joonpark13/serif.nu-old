The class will be a challenging mixture of artistic and technical, with a deeply hands-on approach. <br/><br/>Using Davinci Resolve, you will learn the fundamentals in primary, secondary, and effects color correction, as well as stabilizing and tracking. You'll become familiar with the round-trip workflow between Resolve and various editing programs, and how to best work with Quicktime, RED, Black Magic, and Canon files. While the focus of the class will be on DaVinci Resolve, we will also explore the new color grading capabilities in Adobe Premiere as well as color grading for Effects work such as green-screen using alpha channels. You'll be evaluated through one presentation, several in-class exercises and one main project. There will be a final exam that takes the form of a practical exam. There may be quizzes on readings and workflows. There is one required text: Alexis Van Hurkman, Color Correction Handbook 2nd Edition."}], "lmod": "2/19/17 6:41 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
