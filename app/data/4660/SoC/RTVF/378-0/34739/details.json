Directors or editors MUST submit the current cut of their film via a password protected private link (e.g. Vimeo or YouTube) to the instructor via email BEFORE the first week of classes. This can either be an assembly or rough cut of any length and any genre (e.g. narrative, documentary, experimental, et al). Classes will include: feedback sessions, test-screenings, editing labs and allowing sections of your work to be re-edited by classmates in order to open the work up to further possibilities. Through readings and screenings, we will survey current festival programming to better familiarize yourself with the curatorial landscape. Additionally, you will get an introduction to basic color correction and audio mixing techniques to help you get the piece to a point fit for festival submissions, and to give you the language to communicate with colorists and sound designers/mixers.&quot;"}], "lmod": "2/13/17 6:38 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
