From the &quot;living newspapers&quot; of the 1930's to today's &quot;verbatim theatre,&quot; from documentary film to narrative drama &quot;based on a true story,&quot; non-fiction can provide dramatists with a rich vein of material and raise fascinating issues about the differences between historical and artistic truth.<br/><br/>There will be weekly reading assignments, and each student will assemble an original portfolio of fact-based sources (historical research, contemporary interviews, photographs and video footage, etc.)\u00a0and write at least 30 pages of a new play, film, or television script (narrative or documentary) drawn from that non-fiction material. <br/><br/>CLASS MATERIALS (REQUIRED):<br/><br/>? Aristotle, The Rhetoric and the Poetics<br/>? Lynn Nottage, Ruined<br/>? Moises Kaufman and the Tectonic Theatre Project, The Laramie Project<br/>? Anna Deavere Smith, Fires in the Mirror<br/>?
