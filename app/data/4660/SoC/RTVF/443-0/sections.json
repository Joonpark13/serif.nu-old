[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This class explores the emergence of feminist film theory in the 1970s, of feminist television studies in the 1980s (through some of the \"classic\" work by Mulvey, Doane, Modleski, and others), and the subsequent elaborations and complications of thinking about feminism and media culture in the decades since. This includes considerations of race and sexuality; of the kinds of cultural texts and objects ?worthy' of serious consideration; of the movements between generalities and particularities of theory, texts, and reception; of considerations of mainstream versus alternative media works and media worlds. We will also watch films by women that constitute a kind of critical inquiry of women's status in media culture (e.g. Sally Potter's Thriller; Julie Dash's Illusions; Su Friedrich's Sink or Swim, among others).<br/><br/>The class will include some lectures along with discussion of weekly reading assignments. <br/>Students will write a research paper on topic of their choosing.", "name": "Advanced Seminar in Film & Video", "section": "20", "location": "Annie May Swift Hall 109", "topic": "Feminism and Media Culture", "course": "443-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 5:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/RTVF/443-0/37381", "instructor": ["Miriam B White"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37381", "subject": "RTVF"}]
