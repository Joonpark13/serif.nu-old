This includes considerations of race and sexuality; of the kinds of cultural texts and objects ?worthy' of serious consideration; of the movements between generalities and particularities of theory, texts, and reception; of considerations of mainstream versus alternative media works and media worlds. We will also watch films by women that constitute a kind of critical inquiry of women's status in media culture (e.g. Sally Potter's Thriller; Julie Dash's Illusions; Su Friedrich's Sink or Swim, among others).<br/><br/>The class will include some lectures along with discussion of weekly reading assignments. <br/>Students will write a research paper on topic of their choosing."}], "lmod": "2/14/17 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
