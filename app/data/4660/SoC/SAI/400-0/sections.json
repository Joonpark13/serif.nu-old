[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course will explore the history of the recording industry from the invention of the phonograph in 1877 to recent developments in digital audio. We will examine the social, cultural, and technological factors that have shaped the development of the recording industry, and consider musical genres such as jazz, blues, rock, swing, muzak, dub, techno and rap. We will consider the production, distribution, and reception of recordings, tracking the changing ways in which people have listened to music, from phonograph parlors to jukeboxes to hi-fi home stereos to iPods. The industry in recorded music will be our primary focus, but we will explore synergies with the film industry, radio, gaming, and other emergent digital forms. Some of the key themes in the course will be the intersection of sound industries; the tension between independent and major labels; questions of copyright and creativity in popular music; the relationship between technology and innovation in sound art; and the increasing mobility and cultural ubiquity of recorded sound. Looking back across the \"century of sound\" allows us to gain a deeper appreciation of our current immersion in recorded sound, and to understand the central debates and dynamics that have shaped the recording industry.", "name": "Topics in Sound Studies", "section": "20", "location": "Helmerich Auditorium", "topic": "History of Recording Industry", "course": "400-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/SAI/400-0/34800", "instructor": ["Jacob Arnaud Smith"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34800", "subject": "SAI"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "What does the study of human(s) in specific historical contexts sound like? How does situated listening help us to better understand the ways in which social relations are constituted through sound? This seminar integrates experiential learning with readings and discussions to develop ethnographic skills in listening, recording, editing and representing what John Blacking famously called \"humanly organized sound.\" If the ethnographic process consists of gathering, interpreting and analyzing, and representing ethnographic material, we look at various case studies that analyze field recordings, oral histories, sound archives, listening practices, and commodified sounds as their primary object of study. We ask how sonic phenomena can be used to address key anthropological issues, including but not limited to sensory studies, space and place, historical ethnography, political economy, and the sonic relations of bodies and technologies. Students will be asked to design and conduct an ethnographic project that we will workshop over the course of the term.", "name": "Topics in Sound Studies", "section": "21", "location": "Annie May Swift Hall 110", "topic": "Sound Ethnography", "course": "400-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/SoC/SAI/400-0/34801", "instructor": ["Shayna Mei Silverstein"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34801", "subject": "SAI"}]
