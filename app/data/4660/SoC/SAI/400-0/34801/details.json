How does situated listening help us to better understand the ways in which social relations are constituted through sound? This seminar integrates experiential learning with readings and discussions to develop ethnographic skills in listening, recording, editing and representing what John Blacking famously called &quot;humanly organized sound.&quot; If the ethnographic process consists of gathering, interpreting and analyzing, and representing ethnographic material, we look at various case studies that analyze field recordings, oral histories, sound archives, listening practices, and commodified sounds as their primary object of study. We ask how sonic phenomena can be used to address key anthropological issues, including but not limited to sensory studies, space and place, historical ethnography, political economy, and the sonic relations of bodies and technologies. Students will be asked to design and conduct an ethnographic project that we will workshop over the course of the term."}], "lmod": "2/13/17 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "SAI"}]
