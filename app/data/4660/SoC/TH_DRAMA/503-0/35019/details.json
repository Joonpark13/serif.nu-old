States often rely on embodied practices to demonstrate power in order to govern citizens, while citizen-subjects employ performances to resist, critique, and reconfigure social arrangements of power. We will study how political climates impact the aesthetic and ideological work of a range of performances such as rituals, theatre, opera, parades, mass games, and dance. This seminar is also interdisciplinary, and students will learn and apply various methodological approaches to understanding the intersections of the political with the aesthetic and quotidian in China, India, Indonesia, Japan, and North and South Korea. We will pay special attention to the following topics: the state and public spectacles; the politics of memory; gender and sexual politics; identity and community formation; and transnationalism, diaspora, and globalization."}], "lmod": "2/12/17 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "TH_DRAMA"}]
