[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Whole-Body Thinking: Partnered Swing Dancing as Source of Collaborative Decision-Making In this approach to swing dancing, the goal is for two people to join hands and use the rhythms they hear in swinging, jazz-rhythm-based music as a means of connecting with each other in both motion and emotion.
