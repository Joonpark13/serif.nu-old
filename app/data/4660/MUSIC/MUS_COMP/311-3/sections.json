[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "This course will introduce students of any background or skill level to compositional aesthetics and processes. Students will develop a broad range of skills, analyzing and critiquing different approaches to composition through score study, reading and active listening exercises (with an emphasis on tools, craft, and technique), and creating their own compositions by the end of the quarter. Our primary focus will be on 20th-century and contemporary concert music approaches to parameters including duration, pitch, dynamics, timbre, extended techniques, and theatricality, among others.", "name": "Class Composition", "section": "20", "location": "RCMA Lower Level 113", "topic": "", "course": "311-3", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/MUSIC/MUS_COMP/311-3/35947", "instructor": ["Morgan Lindsay Krauss"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35947", "subject": "MUS_COMP"}]
