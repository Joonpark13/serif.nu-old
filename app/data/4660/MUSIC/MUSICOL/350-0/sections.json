[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "<em>Topics in Medieval Music: History, Notation, Performance</em><br/><p>This course engages Mediterranean and European musics practiced and conceived between the 6th and 14th centuries with focus placed on the historical contexts of music cultures, issues of notation and music literacy, and the performance practices musicians use today. Considering plainchant, organum, song, and motet, the class will be organized as a pro-seminar in which lectures are balanced by student discussion of musical repertoire and significant scholarship. Participants will broaden their existing knowledge of medieval music and history, acquire a working knowledge of traditions of French and Spanish music notation, ponder ideas about the theoretical and cosmological understandings of music in medieval culture, and link music to other medieval arts.</p>", "name": "Topics in Medieval Music", "section": "20", "location": "RCMA 1-160", "topic": "Medieval Music", "course": "350-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/MUSIC/MUSICOL/350-0/35891", "instructor": ["Drew Edward Davies"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "35891", "subject": "MUSICOL"}]
