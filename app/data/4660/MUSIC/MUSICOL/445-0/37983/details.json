Prerequisites are completion of a core sequence of courses on Western music history or previous course work in film, theatre, or comparative literary studies. Our focus will be a select group of operas from the eighteenth- and nineteenth centuries which were based on pre-existing literary or theatrical works, and which, in turn, inspired cinematic or televised works in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries, in one case going through a Broadway musical. In each case, we will study the literary or theatrical inspiration in its own right (those who can are encouraged to read these classic works in their original languages), become familiar with the opera, and proceed to some famous films and other video adaptations of each opera. We will end the course with a popular 1987 film that is directly based on neither a literary original nor an opera, but relies strongly on conventions from both and features a performance of one of our featured operas."}], "lmod": "2/12/17 6:33 PM (CT)", "subject": "MUSICOL"}]
