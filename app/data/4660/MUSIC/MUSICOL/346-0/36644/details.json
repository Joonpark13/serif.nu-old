The answer lies in a complex web of issues, based partially on the unquestionable power and aesthetic appeal of Beethoven&apos;s music, but also on concepts of genius, heroism, politics, myth, and meaning in music that were shifting in the early nineteenth century.</p><p> This course aims to better understand Beethoven&apos;s music by situating it within the aesthetics of the French Revolutionary period, the genres of Classicism and the new subjectivity of the nineteenth century; probing the gestural intersections between Beethoven&apos;s vocal and untexted repertoires; mapping Beethoven&apos;s expansion of music genres; understanding connections between Beethoven&apos;s music and late eighteenth-century religious philosophies; and considering performance practice from the nineteenth century to today.</p><p>Although it is a fairly large 300-level class, it will be run as a pro-seminar, meaning graduate-level group discussion of scholarly readings from upper level academic journals, and independent research work, is expected of all students.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Students taking this course should have some background in music history and performance; some reading knowledge of German is a plus.
