[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "<em>Beethoven</em><br/><p>Scholars, critics, and concertgoers alike regularly characterize Ludwig van Beethoven as the West's, if not the world's, \"greatest composer.\" Why? The answer lies in a complex web of issues, based partially on the unquestionable power and aesthetic appeal of Beethoven's music, but also on concepts of genius, heroism, politics, myth, and meaning in music that were shifting in the early nineteenth century.</p><p> This course aims to better understand Beethoven's music by situating it within the aesthetics of the French Revolutionary period, the genres of Classicism and the new subjectivity of the nineteenth century; probing the gestural intersections between Beethoven's vocal and untexted repertoires; mapping Beethoven's expansion of music genres; understanding connections between Beethoven's music and late eighteenth-century religious philosophies; and considering performance practice from the nineteenth century to today.</p><p>Although it is a fairly large 300-level class, it will be run as a pro-seminar, meaning graduate-level group discussion of scholarly readings from upper level academic journals, and independent research work, is expected of all students.</p>", "name": "Composer Topics", "section": "20", "location": "RCMA 1-172", "topic": "Beethoven", "course": "346-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/MUSIC/MUSICOL/346-0/36644", "instructor": ["Drew Edward Davies"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "36644", "subject": "MUSICOL"}]
