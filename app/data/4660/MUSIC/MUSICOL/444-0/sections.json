[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "This seminar will be devoted to a survey of major scholarly literature on music and cinema from a variety of perspectives (originating from musicology, film studies, and other disciplines). Topics will include music and narrative (beginning from Claudia Gorbman's foundational Unheard Melodies); genre; hermeneutics; authorship and auteurism; sound technology; industry practices and media convergence, among others. Our goal is to absorb and reflect upon a variety of methodological approaches to this area of study, and our fundamental guiding questions will be: \"How, as musicologists, can we study film?\" and/or \"How, as film scholars, can we study music?\" Weekly reading will generally include either a complete scholarly monograph or several articles and chapters on a related topic, and students will be expected to develop and pursue a research project in which the methodologies examined can be put into practice.", "name": "Seminar in Music and Film", "section": "20", "location": "RCMA Lower Level 113", "topic": "", "course": "444-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/MUSIC/MUSICOL/444-0/36645", "instructor": ["Scott Douglas Paulin"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "36645", "subject": "MUSICOL"}]
