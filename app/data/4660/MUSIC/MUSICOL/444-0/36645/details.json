Topics will include music and narrative (beginning from Claudia Gorbman's foundational Unheard Melodies); genre; hermeneutics; authorship and auteurism; sound technology; industry practices and media convergence, among others. Our goal is to absorb and reflect upon a variety of methodological approaches to this area of study, and our fundamental guiding questions will be: &quot;How, as musicologists, can we study film?&quot; and/or &quot;How, as film scholars, can we study music?&quot; Weekly reading will generally include either a complete scholarly monograph or several articles and chapters on a related topic, and students will be expected to develop and pursue a research project in which the methodologies examined can be put into practice."}], "lmod": "2/20/17 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "MUSICOL"}]
