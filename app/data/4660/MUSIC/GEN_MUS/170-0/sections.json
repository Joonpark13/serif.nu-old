Today, whether we are at a concert or in an elevator, music is an integral part of our experiences. Why do we like the music that we like? What about the music that we don't like? Primarily using examples from Western art (Classical) music, this class will consider both universal and culturally specific attributes of musical traditions. Class members will become engaged and critical listeners, consider the backgrounds of music, and develop the concepts necessary to discuss what they hear. This class requires no prior musical training; all students are welcome regardless of past musical experience. Students are expected to complete reading and listening assignments ahead of class meetings, engage with class lectures, participate in discussions, attend concerts (discounted and sometimes free admissions are available for Northwestern University students both on campus and around the Chicago area), submit written assignments, and prepare for quizzes or exams.", "name": "Introduction to Music", "section": "21", "location": "RCMA 1-160", "topic": "", "course": "170-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/MUSIC/GEN_MUS/170-0/35793", "instructor": ["Dane Christian Philipsen"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "35793", "subject": "GEN_MUS"}]
