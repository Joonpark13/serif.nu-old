The purpose of this course is to help students acquire the skills required to arrange pop songs themselves in a contemporary a cappella style.<br/><br/>Students will analyze existing arrangements, listen to current pop a cappella songs, learn about and write in styles from simple transcriptions to full arrangements, and discuss advanced techniques like mash-ups and reharmonization. While it will be helpful to come to the class with a basic ability to read notated music, no prior experience in arranging is necessary. This course will be fine-tuned to individual student needs and strengths in order to meet students at their current skill level."}], "lmod": "2/13/17 6:30 PM (CT)", "subject": "GEN_MUS"}]
