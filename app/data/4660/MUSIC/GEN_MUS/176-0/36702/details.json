It will also address how music teachers can be used as a resource for enhancing learning outside of music. Music can be incorporated into non-music classrooms to illustrate abstract concepts, provide insight into unfamiliar contexts, motivate student engagement, and enhance student learning in general. Curricular areas that will be addressed may vary based upon the teaching areas of enrolled students. Additionally, students will explore integration of music across the curriculum and will develop lessons incorporating music into their own curricular areas. No previous music experiences are expected or required for this course."}], "lmod": "2/12/17 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "GEN_MUS"}]
