We will reflect on what is &quot;black&quot; and what is &quot;popular&quot; about this broad and varied expression, and consider the ways in which the music both represents for black life and is expropriated by mainstream society. The course will help uncover the role music plays in social activism and in the critique of power structures. We will examine how this role problematizes black music's understanding as entertainment."}], "lmod": "2/16/17 6:30 PM (CT)", "subject": "GEN_MUS"}]
