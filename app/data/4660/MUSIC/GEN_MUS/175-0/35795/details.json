Throughout the quarter, we will consider how communities turn to musicians in service of their cultural, political, and affective needs through individual case studies of icons ranging from Richard Wagner to Whitney Houston. Class time will be spent discussing assigned listening and readings, listening as a group, and developing research and writing strategies toward a final term paper."}], "lmod": "2/12/17 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "GEN_MUS"}]
