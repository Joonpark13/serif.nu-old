Among others, case studies to be examined will include: Music and Propaganda in the Renaissance Italian Court; Music and the Reformation; Music and Nationalism; Music under a Totalitarian State; Protest Music and Civil Rights in the 1960s; and Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade. This reading-intensive course will also include weekly listening assignments, weekly Canvas discussion board entries, a midterm, student-led discussion, and a final research project. No prior musical experience is required: Musicians and non-musicians alike are welcome."}], "lmod": "2/12/17 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "GEN_MUS"}]
