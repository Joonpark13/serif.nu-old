This course explores the rich scholarship that has developed as a result. We will consider a number of key canonical texts as well as innovative new work. The course will be centered around close reading and discussion of important texts (ca. 60-100 pages per week). The major project for the quarter will be a substantial analytical and/or theoretical paper. <br/><br/>Significant objectives of the course include the following:<br/>? Familiarity with a wide range of theoretical and analytical approaches to rhythm and meter, including seminal texts as well as recent research<br/>? Understanding of the principal issues and &quot;big questions&quot; of rhythm and meter scholarship<br/>?
