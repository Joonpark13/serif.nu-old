More recently, they have also become the subject of much scholarly research. This course explores various themes, theories, and scenes of electronic dance music. Issues that may be considered include aesthetics; the body in dance, movement, and space; composition and musical design; identity (including gender, sexuality, race, and other constructs); place; pleasure; policing and moral panics; sampling; spirituality and religion; sub-cultural affiliations; and technology.<br/><br/>Dr. Mark J. Butler is a Professor in the program in Music Theory and Cognition in the Henry and Leigh Bienen School of Music. He is an expert on popular music and electronic dance music. He is the author of Unlocking the Groove (Indiana, 2006) and Playing with Something That Runs (Oxford, 2014) and the editor of Electronica, Dance, and Club Music (Ashgate, 2012)."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Although the course is labeled MUS_THRY, as Music Theory is the professor's home program, it will not be a music theory course per se. Rather, it will be broadly interdisciplinary. Students from outside the Bienen School of Music are welcome, and ability to read musical notation is not a prerequisite. Undergraduates should have junior-level standing or higher."}], "lmod": "2/21/17 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "MUS_THRY"}]
