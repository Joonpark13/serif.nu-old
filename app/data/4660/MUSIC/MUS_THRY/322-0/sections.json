[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "During the past three decades the topic of rhythm and meter has become one of the most active and productive areas of investigation in music theory. This course explores the rich scholarship that has developed as a result. We will consider a number of key canonical texts as well as innovative new work. The course will be centered around close reading and discussion of important texts (ca. 60-100 pages per week). The major project for the quarter will be a substantial analytical and/or theoretical paper. <br/><br/>Significant objectives of the course include the following:<br/>? Familiarity with a wide range of theoretical and analytical approaches to rhythm and meter, including seminal texts as well as recent research<br/>? Understanding of the principal issues and \"big questions\" of rhythm and meter scholarship<br/>? Enhanced ability to analyze aspects of rhythm and meter in music and to apply analysis in support of larger arguments<br/>? Enhanced ability to conduct independent research", "name": "Rhythm and Meter", "section": "20", "location": "RCMA Lower Level 111", "topic": "", "course": "322-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/MUSIC/MUS_THRY/322-0/36429", "instructor": ["Mark Jonathan Butler"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "36429", "subject": "MUS_THRY"}]
