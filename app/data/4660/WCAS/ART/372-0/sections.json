Today, along with art objects, art subjects are exteriorized. Having evacuated its core and essence, the individual is now performative, on-demand and just-in-time, in constant feedback with her or his specific context from one moment to the next. From object-oriented ontology to theorizations of information, this class will explore how the centered subject has been displaced.
