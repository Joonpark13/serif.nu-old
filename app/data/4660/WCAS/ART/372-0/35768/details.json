Today, along with art objects, art subjects are exteriorized. Having evacuated its core and essence, the individual is now performative, on-demand and just-in-time, in constant feedback with her or his specific context from one moment to the next. From object-oriented ontology to theorizations of information, this class will explore how the centered subject has been displaced. And we'll look at the consequences for the &quot;self&quot; ? as it transforms performatively and communicationally into the agent, operator, avatar, professional and manager, someone who, according to Jean Baudrillard, has given up dramaturgical and symbolic identifications for &quot;organizational values,&quot; who privileges relationships &quot;no longer of an instinctive or a psychological but, rather, of a tactical kind,&quot; who imagines itself reigning &quot;at the controls of a hypothetical machine, isolated in a position of perfect and remote sovereignty, at an infinite distance from his original universe; that is to say, in the same position as an astronaut in his bubble ... in orbit, living no longer as an actor or a dramaturge but as a terminal of multiple networks.&quot;<br/><br/>Pre-Requisite: Art 272 or one 300-level course in the department or permission of intstructor."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Pre-Requisite: Art 272 or one 300-level course in the department or permission of intstructor."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}], "lmod": "2/7/17 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "ART"}]
