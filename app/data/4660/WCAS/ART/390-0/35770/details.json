We will consider the historic precedents an contemporary trajectory of objects that blur the line between painting and sculpture. Beginning with Donald Judd's Specific Objects essay from 1965, the class will attempt to trace a lineage of artworks that embody this hybrid nature. Lectures, readings and materials demonstrations will frame each project. The course will consist of five projects that explore a range of contemporary concerns through formal approaches like casting, weaving, dyeing, digital printing, and traditional painting processes. This course will not only attempt to decode the current strategies of object making but expand on a field that is continually forcing collisions between increasingly disparate materials and styles. <br/><br/>Pre-requisite: A minimum of one Art Theory &amp; Practice course and undergraduate standing."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Pre-requisite: A minimum of one Art Theory &amp; Practice course and undergraduate standing."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lectures, readings and materials demonstrations will frame each project."}], "lmod": "2/21/17 6:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "ART"}]
