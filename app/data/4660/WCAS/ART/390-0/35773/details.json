Scott that explores forms of daily resistance against authority in agrarian societies. Together, we will examine how weakness and power are constructed and the potential roles of creative production in complicating those hierarchies. Performance techniques of Image and Forum Theater will serve as frequent departure points for personal and collective exploration. Image-making and time-based practices are highly encouraged and students will have access to the digital lab and printing facilities, though interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary practices are welcome.<br/><br/>Readings include texts from Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, Paolo Freire, Hito Steyerl, Gloria Anzaldua, Mimi Thi Nguyen, James C.
