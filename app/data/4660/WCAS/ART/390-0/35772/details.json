Many contemporary artists use the medium of printmaking in interdisciplinary ways to form and conceptualize ideas. Students will be introduced to a brief history of printmaking and how contemporary artists use print techniques towards creative expression. The course will provide an introduction to a variety of traditional and and non-traditional print techniques including: chine colle, digital printing, monoprinting, relief, photocopying and silkscreen. <br/><br/>Through course readings and assigned studio projects, student will develop the skills to analyze both theoretical arguments and works of art. We will create original works of art that exist as multiples in editioned sets, and will also make singular prints. By the end of the course students will be able to produce images through a variety of print techniques with the hope that this will influence and affect their greater studio practice. This process will be explored through hands-on practice, wherein students will learn the practice and technical skills involved in making various kinds of print."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Pre-requisite: A minimum of one Art Theory &amp; Practice studio course."}], "lmod": "2/21/17 6:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "ART"}]
