We will consider the constitutional responses of countries such as the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Kenya, South Africa and Australia to the challenges of terrorist bombings, the rise of populism, hate crimes, legitimacy of public authority, and refugee crisis and examine the birth of constitutionalism that is currently underway in Africa where the peaceful exchange of power, a value that we have taken for granted, is still an aspiration for countries such as Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In learning about the varying traditions of written and unwritten constitutions, civil and common law and the foundations and structures of separation of powers and judicial review of the constitutionality of laws in these countries, students will learn to think critically about the U.S. Constitution and the different ways in which constitutional democracies provide for public order, counter-majoritarian governance, equality and protection of the rights of minorities through rule of law and question whether constitutional solutions can address the kinds of social and political problems we have today.", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Topics in Legal Studies", "title": "WCAS LEGAL_ST 376-0-20 Topics in Legal Studies", "lmod": "2/22/17 6:48 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Galya Benarieh Ruffer", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "Constitutional Challenges in Comparative Perspecti", "course": "376-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Legal Studies 376-0-20 &quot;Comparative Constitutionalism: Constitutional Challenges in Comparative Perspective&quot;, Galya Ben-Arieh Ruffer, Spring 2017 (also Poli_Sci 390-0-24)<br/><br/>In this course we will be thinking about how and whether constitutions shape national values and offer a framework for legitimacy and governance to hold together diverse societies and resolve deeply rooted social tensions and ethnic divisions.

Students will learn about the different ways in which constitutions structure government, freedoms and protect the rights of citizens and minorities. <br/>? In exploring these topics, students will learn how constitutional designs respond to competing claims, try to diffuse controversy and accommodate different constituencies. <br/>? The intention of considering these different approaches is to enable students to improve their capacities to think systematically about constitutions, different structures for organizing governments and establishing just and efficacious governments, and about the role of constitutional law and courts.<br/>? Throughout this course, students will develop critical reading, thinking, and writing skills<br/>?
