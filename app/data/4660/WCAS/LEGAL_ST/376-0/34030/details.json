We will consider the constitutional responses of countries such as the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Kenya, South Africa and Australia to the challenges of terrorist bombings, the rise of populism, hate crimes, legitimacy of public authority, and refugee crisis and examine the birth of constitutionalism that is currently underway in Africa where the peaceful exchange of power, a value that we have taken for granted, is still an aspiration for countries such as Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In learning about the varying traditions of written and unwritten constitutions, civil and common law and the foundations and structures of separation of powers and judicial review of the constitutionality of laws in these countries, students will learn to think critically about the U.S. Constitution and the different ways in which constitutional democracies provide for public order, counter-majoritarian governance, equality and protection of the rights of minorities through rule of law and question whether constitutional solutions can address the kinds of social and political problems we have today."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "? Students will learn about the different ways in which constitutions structure government, freedoms and protect the rights of citizens and minorities. <br/>? In exploring these topics, students will learn how constitutional designs respond to competing claims, try to diffuse controversy and accommodate different constituencies. <br/>? The intention of considering these different approaches is to enable students to improve their capacities to think systematically about constitutions, different structures for organizing governments and establishing just and efficacious governments, and about the role of constitutional law and courts.<br/>? Throughout this course, students will develop critical reading, thinking, and writing skills<br/>? By the end of the quarter, students should be able to understand and explain some of the similarities and differences in doctrines of law, analyze the assumptions of courts and policy makers, and understand how constitutional law responds differently to political, social and economic challenges in these countries."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Discussion, short response papers and final paper"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Scheppele, Kim Lane (2004), ?Constitutional Ethnography: An Introduction', Law and Society Review 38(3): 389-406.<br/>Hirschl, Ran?Comparative matters : the renaissance of comparative constitutional law Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 <br/>Tushnet, Mark V.?Advanced introduction to comparative constitutional law Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, [2014]"}], "lmod": "2/12/17 6:57 PM (CT)", "subject": "LEGAL_ST"}]
