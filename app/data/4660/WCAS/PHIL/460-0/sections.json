[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "It is widely held that prudence?specifically, the balanced concern for one's future good?is a requirement of rationality. Further, the rationality of prudence is often thought of as distinct from, and on surer footing than, any alleged rational requirement to act morally. \"Why should I be moral?\" is a perennial question in ethics; \"Why should I pursue my own good?\" is rarely considered a question worth raising. In this seminar, we will look at some arguments from recent moral philosophy that call this standard outlook into question. We will look at works by several philosophers?including, especially, Nagel, Parfit, and Korsgaard?who, in different ways, approach the rational foundations of morality by way of a reconsideration of prudential reason. In particular, we will consider arguments that the rational justification for taking an immediate, altruistic interest in the good of others is parallel to the rational justification for taking an immediate, prudential interest in one's own future good. We will also take up questions about the normativity of self-interest or self-concern. For example, do considerations relating to one's own good provide one with private or agent-relative reasons for action? How else might we understand the distinctive ethical significance for a person of her own life and interests?", "name": "Seminar in Ethical Theory", "section": "20", "location": "University Library 4670", "topic": "", "course": "460-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/PHIL/460-0/34527", "instructor": ["Stephen John White"], "class_attributes": "Graduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "34527", "subject": "PHIL"}]
