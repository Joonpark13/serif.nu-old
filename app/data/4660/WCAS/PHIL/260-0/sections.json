[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Moral philosophy is the systematic study of a range of questions, including: \"What do we owe to others?\" \"Why should we think moral norms have authority over us?\", and \"What makes a person's life go best?\" Over the course of the semester, students will be invited to engage directly with these questions and to evaluate which of four major moral theories?consequentialism, kantianism, contractualism, virtue ethics?offers us the most compelling way of answering them. Along the way, we will draw on real-world ethical problems?e.g. workplace conflict, sexual harassment, racism, migration, humanitarian aid, etc.?in an effort to test and critically assess the philosophical theories we study.", "name": "Introduction to Moral Philosophy", "section": "20", "location": "Fisk Hall 217", "topic": "", "course": "260-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/PHIL/260-0/34473", "instructor": [""], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34473", "subject": "PHIL"}]
