We'll begin with Augustine, who treats love and desire as basic and characteristic of moral thinking-thought about the right and the good. We'll end with Confucius and his followers, who think that love is a skill-and so it can't be what Augustine thought it must be. In between we'll read sources outside of the normal philosophical canon, from women writing in 17th c. Britain, to Tibetan Buddhists, and perhaps some more as well."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Think clearly about philosophical topics.<br/>Know how to clarify thought, both one's own and that of others.<br/>How to demonstrate these things in writing."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Short papers and exercises, longer papers, and perhaps presentations."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Readings to be distributed."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Only for first-year students."}], "lmod": "2/6/17 6:53 PM (CT)", "subject": "PHIL"}]
