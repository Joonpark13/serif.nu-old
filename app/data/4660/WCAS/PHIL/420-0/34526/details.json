Plato thought so; Aristotle thought not, and issued a series of stinging objections intended to register his dissatisfaction with Plato's approach. The division inaugurated in their exchange has never really left philosophy. In virtually every era, employing a variety of different idioms, philosophers have debated this question, together with a series of consequential issues in axiology and practical reason, concerning: the comparability and commensurability of value; preference and choice in a pluralistic value world; the connection between intellectual value assessment and the will; the additivity of value; organic goodness; and the character of intrinsic and final goods. In this seminar, we will investigate these issues in their original dialectical context."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Two papers, one seminar presentation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "The Complete works of Aristotle<br/><br/>Plato, Complete Works"}], "lmod": "2/7/17 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "PHIL"}]
