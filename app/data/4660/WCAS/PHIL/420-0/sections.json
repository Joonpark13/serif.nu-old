[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Already in antiquity philosophers divided over the question of whether goodness?to use Aristotle's phrase?is ?something universal, common to all good things, and single' (EN 1096a28). Plato thought so; Aristotle thought not, and issued a series of stinging objections intended to register his dissatisfaction with Plato's approach. The division inaugurated in their exchange has never really left philosophy. In virtually every era, employing a variety of different idioms, philosophers have debated this question, together with a series of consequential issues in axiology and practical reason, concerning: the comparability and commensurability of value; preference and choice in a pluralistic value world; the connection between intellectual value assessment and the will; the additivity of value; organic goodness; and the character of intrinsic and final goods. In this seminar, we will investigate these issues in their original dialectical context.", "name": "Studies in Ancient Philosophy", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge 3438 Philosophy Sem.
