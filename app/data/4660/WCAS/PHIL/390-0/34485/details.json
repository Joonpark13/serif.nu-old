How could we make it so? This is one of the central questions of philosophy and religion. This course will look at historical and comparative theories of justice from theological and philosophical sources in the Western Tradition. We will begin by a review of justice theory within the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament and the Quran, and consider the Enlightenment ideas of citizenship and contracts, asking how the theories work in our own time. We will explore how the concepts of fairness, treatment of the vulnerable, equity, freedom, rights and contracts expand our historical ideas about how to distribute social goods in a world of scarcity and finitude. We will critically examine the turn toward utility and happiness, then to contract theories of justice as modernity expanded our ideas of what is necessary, and what can be shared. We will explore contemporary theories of justice, including Rawls (and his critics,) Singer, Nussbaum. Sachs, and challenges to liberal theorists by liberation theology, African American political theory, and feminist critique. The class will conclude with an exploration of how justice theories are applied in practical terms against problems of access and distribution in American public life."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "The student will learn basic theories of justice<br/>The student will be able to explain how the principles that underwrite these theories change over time<br/>The student will be able to articulate methods of addressing problems in contemporary distributive justice and analyze their success as strategies for fairness, equity, and citizenship"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "DiscussionGroup workLectureSeminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "5 quite short papers (every other week) that summarize and critically explore the readings- 25%<br/>one multiple choice midterm exam- 25% <br/>one group paroject- 25%<br/>one final exam- 25%"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Six Theories of Justice, Karen LeBacqz (paperback edition)<br/>Justice: A Reader, Michael Sandel (paperback edition)<br/>All other readings will be available online on the course site."}], "lmod": "2/20/17 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "PHIL"}]
