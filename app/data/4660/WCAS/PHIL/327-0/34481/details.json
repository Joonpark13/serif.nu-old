It will be organized around group of fundamental questions. First, is the mind like a computer program? If so, what kind? Is it organized like a symbolic computation system, or like a complex network of associations? What does this tell us about how the mind relates to the brain? Second, to what extent is the mind organized around separate `modules', as opposed to being one single general intelligence engine? Third, to what extent are our cognitive abilities innate, and to what extent are they acquired through learning? Readings will be drawn from classic and contemporary papers in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Students will develop an understanding of central issues in the philosophy of psychology, mastery of a range of philosophical tools and techniques, and the ability to apply these to specific problems in the philosophy of psychology and the foundations of cognitive science."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Short papers, final exam, and class participation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Robert Cummins and Denise Dellarosa Cummins (eds.), Minds, Brains, and Computers: The Foundations of Cognitive Science, Blackwell Publishers, 2000.
