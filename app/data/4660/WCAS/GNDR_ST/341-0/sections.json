[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is situated at the intersection of theoretical, cultural, medical, and commercial online discourses concerning the burgeoning GCS-related surgeries (Gender Confirmation Surgery) presented online and conducted in Bangkok, Thailand. Using \"Trans\" theories: transgender, transnational, translation, spatio/temporal, we will discuss the intersections, dialogues, refusals, and adaptions when thinking about medical travel to Thailand. We will examine Thai cultural/historical conceptions of sex and gender, debates concerning bodies and diagnoses, and changes in presentations of sex/gender related surgeries offered online. Comparative cultural studies, medical discourses, and an archive of web images offering SRS surgeries to Thailand produced by Thais for western clientele will serve as axes for investigating this topic.<br/><br/>Course Objectives:<br/>We will be studying this topic using Three Axes:<br/>1 Comparative Culture<br/>How sex gender system in Thailand is/was historically different than what we take as normal.

Class texts will explore ?risk' through case studies of militarization and refugees; child trafficking and forced migration; the politics of commercial surrogacy; and international development and labor exploitation. Drawing on readings from the anthropology of development, international studies, and feminist technoscience studies, students will discuss and question discourses of ?globalization' that imagine a world of easy connections and flows, digitally and physically. We engage with multiple media forms, from academic texts, to films like Children of Men and the poetry of Warsan Shire, to explore how migration stories are gendered and racialized, with particular agencies and vulnerabilities, perils and pleasures. By understanding the techniques and technologies of bureaucracy, through examples like airport facial recognition software, so-called ?smart border walls,' and US counter-terrorism initiatives, students will also assess expert cultures dictating migration and development futures.", "name": "Transnational Perspectives on Gender and Sexuality", "section": "21", "location": "University Hall 122", "topic": "Risky Borders: Sex, Race, and Techniques of Border", "course": "341-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/GNDR_ST/341-0/33913", "instructor": ["Mitali   Thakor"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33913", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}]
