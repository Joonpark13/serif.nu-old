We will examine Thai cultural/historical conceptions of sex and gender, debates concerning bodies and diagnoses, and changes in presentations of sex/gender related surgeries offered online. Comparative cultural studies, medical discourses, and an archive of web images offering SRS surgeries to Thailand produced by Thais for western clientele will serve as axes for investigating this topic.<br/><br/>Course Objectives:<br/>We will be studying this topic using Three Axes:<br/>1 Comparative Culture<br/>How sex gender system in Thailand is/was historically different than what we take as normal.
