To do so, we will first aim to understand and theorize the historical, social, and cultural conditions that have produced black male bodies as charged sites of violence and visualization in the U.S. public sphere. With this framework in place, we will proceed to home in on particular exhibitions, objects, and practices that help illuminate the ongoing logics that structure the appearance of black masculinity as well as the ways cultural practitioners have variously contested them. Artists considered will include David Hammons, Titus Kaphar, Kerry James Marshall, Jacolby Satterwhite, and Sun Ra. All readings will be available for free via Canvas."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationPaper, finalWriting assignments"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Selections from the work of Elizabeth Alexander, James Baldwin, Frantz Fanon, Roderick Ferguson, Gleen Ligon, David Marriott, Kobena Mercer, Fred Moton, Hortense Spillers, Maurice O.
