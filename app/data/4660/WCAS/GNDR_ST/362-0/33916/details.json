But what makes a woman &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; in the first place? What is a &quot;bad girl,&quot; anyway? This course will examine dramatic representations of unruly, cruel, and otherwise nasty women as they appear in Renaissance English drama. We will consider the stubborn independence?and abusive &quot;taming&quot;?of Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew; the cross-dressing, hard-drinking, gutter-dwelling Moll Cutpurse in Middleton and Dekker's The Roaring Girl; and the incestuous Annabella in Ford's 'Tis Pity She's a Whore. And, while we will focus on Renaissance texts, we will also ask what &quot;bad girls&quot; on the seventeenth-century stage can teach us about the performance of female rebelliousness today by regularly assessing their similarities and dissimilarities from present-day narratives, including Rihanna's self-presentation as &quot;Bad Gal Riri&quot; and the tragicomic tales of incarcerated women in Netflix's Orange is the New Black."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "LectureSeminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationPapersPresentationsWriting assignments"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Assigned readings are likely to include Shakespeare, Taming of the Shrew (ca. 1594); Fletcher, The Woman's Prize, or the Tamer Tamed (ca. 1611); Webster, Duchess of Malfi (ca. 1612-13); Ford, 'Tis Pity She's a Whore (1633); Jonson, Epic?ne (1610); Middleton &amp; Dekker, The Roaring Girl (1611); Cavendish, The Convent of Pleasure (1668); and occasional short scholarly articles"}], "lmod": "2/7/17 6:43 PM (CT)", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}]
