Our main focus will be on the Arab intellectuals and their literary output. Following some core readings, students will spend most of the quarter working toward the production of a term paper based on primary sources. Depending on the students' linguistic abilities and/or the availability of translations, possible topics might include the rise of nationalist ideas and other political mass ideologies, the impact of the social sciences on Islamic scholarship, changing views of socio-political &quot;progress,&quot; and the question of feminism. The seminar will also cover some methodological issues to help students with the writing process."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Participation (30%), One 5 pg.
