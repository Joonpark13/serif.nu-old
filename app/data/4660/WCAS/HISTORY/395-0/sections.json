[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What does the \"national home\" for the Jewish people, mention in the 1917 Balfour Declaration, imply? Why Jewish nationalists decided to choose Palestine to establish the Jewish state? Why did they prefer the elitist Hebrew to their contemporary spoken German, Russian, or Yiddish? How did they plan to deal with the Arab population in the contemporary Palestine? Focusing on Europe and the Middle East between the 1850s and the 1930s, this course explores the rise of the Jewish Diaspora nationalism, known as Zionism, discusses the forging of modern Jewish political identities, showcases the early stages of the Jewish resettlement in the land of Israel and delves into the causes of modern Middle Eastern conflicts. The course considers Zionism against the backdrop of rising European nationalisms and links Jewish nationalism to the modernization of Jewish life, to new trends in Judaism, to the nineteenth and twentieth century cultural myths, to the emerging racial antisemitism and new types of mass violence, and to the demise of multi-ethnic empires. Students will consider the contribution to Zionist movement of such figures as Theodor Herzl, Ahad ha-Am, Eliezer ben Yehuda, and Zeev Jabotinsky. Explore how diverse groups of national-minded individuals transformed themselves into an ambitious modern political movement, which helped create the State of Israel and shaped contradictions that plague this state to date.", "name": "Research Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "555 Clark 230", "topic": "Origins of Zionism", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/395-0/34271", "instructor": ["Yohanan   Petrovsky-Shtern"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34271", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar is designed to provide students of history, Asian studies, and international affairs with the opportunity to engage in sustained historical research and writing over the course of an entire quarter. The first two-thirds of the course will be devoted to reading a variety of source materials relating to the subject of imperialism in East, South, and Southeast Asia. The last third of the course will be devoted to the research and writing of a term paper on any topic of your choice relating to the history of colonialism and imperialism in these regions. Students may wish to examine certain genres of primary source material: missionary writings, diplomatic correspondence, or travel literature, for example. Or students might wish to evaluate the secondary source literature on those topics concerning which there has been extended scholarly debate (for example, the Vietnam Wars; the Japanese occupation of Southeast Asia; the American enterprise in the Philippines; some aspect of British imperialism in India, Singapore, or Hong Kong; the Boxer Uprising and War; some aspect of the Cold War in Asia; gender and empire in a particular place; and so on). The purpose of this paper is not to write a major undergraduate study, but to write the kind of polished term paper that is not usually possible during the frenzied schedule of the quarter system.

Even if you think that's more or less what happened, Soviet society was so large, and so complex, that the larger story was composed of many separate but overlapping stories. Members of the seminar will explore one of those smaller stories: why did the economic reforms create an ever deepening economic crisis? Why did the Soviet government lose control over the constituent Soviet republics (pick a republic)? Why did Gorbachev introduce competitive elections, and what were their consequences? Why did the many senior members of the Soviet government and Communist Party who opposed what Gorbachev was doing not kick him out of power? Why were many Russians willing allow many of the non-Russian republics to secede? Did the economic pressure on the Soviet Union exerted by the Reagan arms buildup contribute to the collapse, as some believe? And there are many other important components of the Soviet collapse to explore. You will try to answer your question by reading the many primary sources that are available in English translation, memoirs by Soviet leaders, and relevant scholarly studies.", "name": "Research Seminar", "section": "26", "location": "University Hall 218", "topic": "Death of the Soviet Empire", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/395-0/34274", "instructor": ["John Starkes   Bushnell"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34274", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this research seminar on the history of American technology, students write the social biography of an artifact of their choice.

This will involve reading some exemplary \"social histories of artifacts\" from the American Revolution to the Computer Revolution: from Colt revolvers and Raggedy Ann dolls, to the safety bicycle and electric grid, to the Macintosh computer and the Internet of Things. And it will mean learning some intellectual tools to set such objects in their historical context, including: network analysis, systems theory, attention to gender and race, the theory of affordances, evolutionary theory, social constructionism, and technological determinism.
