Yet Africa continues to play a peripheral role in Indian Ocean studies. In this course, we will focus on historical sources and historiographies that highlight the central and multi-faceted role that Africans have played in the region's history. Focusing on the movement of peoples and things and ideas and imaginations, we are concerned with the diverse experiences and meanings of mobility; how was the experience of migration different for enslaved Africans, merchants, and indentured laborers? How did fashion trends in Zanzibar affect the lives of cotton producers in India? What ideas did Africans share with their fellow dwellers of the Indian Ocean? How do Africans draw on Indian Ocean connections and imaginations in contemporary politics? Examining a range of primary sources alongside the analysis of historians and social scientists, a core question of this course is: how do different kinds of sources produce different historical narratives and spaces? This course is designed to encourage you to think critically about the spaces that we study and explore both the possibilities of an Indian Ocean framework and its limits for understanding East African history."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "AREA OF CONCENTRATION - Africa/Middle East"}], "lmod": "2/20/17 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
