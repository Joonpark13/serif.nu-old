[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course covers the development of the group of people known today as African Americans. This history is rooted in the cultures of Africa, Europe and the Americas; the experience of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade; the exploration and colonization of North America; and the founding of the United States as a nation distinct from the rest of the Americas. Central to this history is an understanding of slavery and freedom; the development of ideas of race and racism; and the human rights struggle embodied in the anti-slavery movement, which would lead to the end of slavery in the United States.", "name": "Introduction to African American History: Key Concepts from 1700-1861", "section": "1", "location": "University Hall 101", "topic": "", "course": "212-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/212-1/34364", "instructor": ["Leslie Maria Harris"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34364", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
