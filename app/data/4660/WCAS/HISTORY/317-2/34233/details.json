However, work hard! This course traces the history of modern American culture by examining prominent movies from the dawn of film to the present. It is NOT a history of film, but instead a history of American culture that uses film as evidence. Most students find movies fun to engage but challenging to use as historical documents, so this course is not &quot;easy.&quot; Students should have comfort with film as medium and some knowledge of modern US history. Monday and Wednesday sessions will be for lectures (broken up by film clips); Tuesday sessions for screening films. Students are required to attend lecture and movie sessions (and discussions), at which attendance will be taken. because viewing assigned films in isolation on some computer screen is no substitute for seeing them on a large screen in a group. Do NOT take this class if you foresee scheduling conflicts with lecture, movie sessions or discussion sections: simply showing up is a vital part of the work in this class. This class keeps you very busy during the week (with a short writing assignment due each Friday), and almost entirely free over weekends. Many Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday sessions will end earlier than the official ending times."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture, Film Screenings, &amp; Discussion Sections"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Attendance (ALL SESSIONS), Participation, Weekly Short Response Papers, &amp; a Short Final Essay"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Numerous short scholarly &amp; popular writings"}], "lmod": "2/20/17 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
