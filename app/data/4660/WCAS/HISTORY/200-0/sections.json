We now have several decades' worth of research from the social sciences and humanities showing that so-called \"natural\" disasters are not very natural at all. Instead, they are deeply political and profoundly man-made. This course adopts a historical and global approach in order to denaturalize disaster. From famines in British India to earthquakes in post-colonial Peru, from floods in New Orleans to nuclear disaster in Japan, we will see how disasters expose and exacerbate pre-existing inequalities, inflicting suffering disproportionately among those groups already marginalized by race, class, gender, geography, and age. These inequalities shape not only the impact of the disaster but the range of responses to it, including political critique and retrenchment, relief and rebuilding efforts, memorialization, and planning - or failing to plan - for future disasters of a similar kind. The course culminates in a unit on the contemporary challenge of anthropogenic global climate change, the ultimate man-made disaster. We will consider how memories, fears, and fantasies of past disasters are being repurposed to create new visions of what climate change will look like.", "name": "New Introductory Courses in History", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-415", "topic": "Global History of Natural Disasters", "course": "200-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/200-0/34373", "instructor": ["Lydia   Barnett"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34373", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The term ?natural disaster' conjures images of tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanoes, and other powerful forces of nature that strike without warning, inflicting massive suffering on a powerless and unsuspecting populace.

However, in this course, we will begin with the premise that what we know about ?Asian America' is founded and sustained by what might be called ?social movements,' mobilizations of people who have become conscious of an issue or issues that affect them and make them want to do something collectively about it. While reading some texts that I have assigned that give examples of Asian Americans engaging in the work of social movements, I propose that our task should be to evaluate whether these movements have been effective. To do that, we will also spend some time reading Gary Okihiro's Third World Studies in relation to the Brazilian educator Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed as a text that will help us to think about the actual operation of Asian American social movements.", "name": "New Introductory Courses in History", "section": "24", "location": "University Hall 102", "topic": "Asian American Social Movements", "course": "200-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/200-0/34375", "instructor": ["Justin K Tse"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34375", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
