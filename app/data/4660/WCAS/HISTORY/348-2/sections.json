[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The 1917 February revolution emancipated Jews of the Russian Empire; in 1991, the collapse of communism triggered mass emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union. Based on multi- media power-point presentations, this lecture course illuminates the encounter of Jews as a national minority with the communist state in general and leftist ideology in particular. It explores Jewish responses to communism using archival photos and Soviet propaganda posters, Jewish film, music and art, Yiddish literature and folklore, secret KGB and the USSR communist party documents. The course seeks to answer a number of pertinent questions: Whom were Jews living in the USSR between 1917 and 1991? Why were they so remarkably visible among the ruling and elite under Stalin and why did Stalin make them targets of his xenophobic campaign? Why did the communist regime suppress the memorization of the Holocaust in the USSR? Ultimately, what made Russians call the Soviet citizens of Jewish origin \"Jews\" and what makes Americans call former Soviet Jews \"Russians\"? The course integrates the Soviet Jews into the transformation of the Soviet empire and questions the role of Jews in this process. Explore the political, social, religious, cultural, literary, and artistic aspects of the interaction of the East European Jews with communism.", "name": "Jews in Poland, Ukraine, and Russia", "section": "1", "location": "Harris Hall L06", "topic": "", "course": "348-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/348-2/34368", "instructor": ["Yohanan   Petrovsky-Shtern"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "34368", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
