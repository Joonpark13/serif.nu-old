According to a 2015 poll by the Pew Research Center, 59% of Americans believe that science and religion are &quot;often in conflict.&quot; As many as 30% of Americans believe that science often contradicts their own religious beliefs. And how people think about the relationship between science and religion correlates strongly with their positions on a range of policy issues, from the teachings of evolution in public school to the ethics of genetic modification. As timeless as it may seem, however, the notion of a science-religion conflict is relatively young. This course will explore its origins, evolution, and ramifications over the last century and a half, devoting special attention to global contexts from which the &quot;conflict thesis&quot; emerged in the late nineteenth century, including colonialism, Christian missionizing, and a boom in science popularization."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "DiscussionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "ExamsPapers"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "AREA OF CONCENTRATION - Global"}], "lmod": "2/16/17 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
