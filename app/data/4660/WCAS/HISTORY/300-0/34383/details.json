The story began on a December evening in 1955, when Mrs. Rosa Parks refused to give her up a seat on a Montgomery, Alabama bus. From that single act of defiance surged a social movement that raced across the South of the 1950s and 1960s: through Little Rock and Greensboro, to Birmingham and Selma, into the Mississippi Delta and up to Memphis, where it came to a brutal, bloody end with the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King in the spring of 1968. <br/><br/>In this course, we will expand the movement's history, tracing it across the twentieth century, extending it from the Deep South to the urban north and out to the West Coast, following a wide variety of political perspectives. Out of that process, the course will develop a more complex - and hopefully convincing - interpretation of one of the most important social movements in the American experience."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture &amp; Discussion Sections"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Participation, Essay Assignments"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "James Goodman.
