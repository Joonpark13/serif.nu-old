We will explore European perceptions of the world outside what is traditionally conceived of as Europe, and what impact the interpretations of and relationships with that world had on the early modern period. The seminar will analyze the relationship between Europe and the Ottoman Empire, and how ongoing conflict and coexistence with the Ottomans shaped the Renaissance worldview; we will also discuss the realities and the limits of a shared Mediterranean world. The course will also analyze the significance of the discovery of the New World and what it meant when Europe truly became part of a global system. Should the Ottoman Empire be included as part of the geographic, sociopolitical, and cultural entity traditionally known as Europe? What is the history behind the very concept of East and West, or East versus West as in the dangerous &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; thesis? Themes of empire, warfare, and religion (as well as religious conversion and slavery) will also be addressed, in addition to perceptions of &quot;the other&quot; from both sides of the Mediterranean Sea."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Participation, Weekly One Page Reading Responses or Canvas Submitted Discussion Questions, Two Short Papers (5 pgs. each), &amp; Final Essay (12-15 pgs.)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Brian Levack, Edward Muir, Meredith Veldman, &amp; Michael Maas.
