And yet there are places where individuals and their lives have survived the oblivion of history and where something of their lived experience can be recovered. These places indicate productive sites of knowing not only about the small histories of the past, but how these speak to, and elucidate, relations of power and aspects of global history. While this course will focus specifically on an archive assembled in the 1870s and 1880s in colonial South Africa (the Bleek and Lloyd Archive), comprising thousands of pages of interviews with several prisoners described at the time as indigenous hunter-gatherers, or \"Cape Bushmen\" (now known as |xam), and 4 young displaced boys from northern Namibia, it will also be attentive to the importance of thinking about archives in unconventional ways. The course will give students the opportunity to work with primary sources, - including photographs, maps, genealogies and drawings, as well as stories of origin, of conflict with settlers and relationships with animals, of murder, hunting, personal histories, and of times stretching into the pre-colonial past - to consider visual and object sources, and to think about the effect the making of an archive has on the histories it is able to generate.", "name": "Topics In History", "section": "20", "location": "555 Clark 230", "topic": "Origins of Zionism", "course": "392-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/392-0/34260", "instructor": ["Yohanan   Petrovsky-Shtern"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34260", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Is there such a thing as a resource curse? More than any other part of the world, the Middle East is closely associated with both extreme abundance (oil) and extreme scarcity (water), and with the politics to which competition over these two resources has given rise. Scholars of the Middle East have recently begun to reckon with how the interconnections between people, environment, and natural resources have shaped the region politically, economically, and socially. In this course, we will survey the modern history of the Middle East and consider such things as water management in the late Ottoman period, and the construction of irrigation systems and national water carriers in the 20th century. The course also considers the emergence of the oil industry, and the construction of national, regional, and international systems for resource extraction, refinement, and transport.

As a result, we will examine the work of academic historians as well as primary sources such as essays and novels, movies, and music. We will use the different items of this class to think through some of the broader thematic continuities and shifts of the era and use these facts and examples to construct our own understandings of the era and how it has shaped contemporary American politics, culture, economics, and society. This class will use various episodes and events throughout the 1970s to ask certain questions and hopefully glean worthwhile answers. We will ask ourselves if and how the 1970s dismantled the postwar political consensus? We will also attempt to answer if the language of individual rights and free market ideology that erupted during the 1970s produced a more or less equitable society? How did civil rights, feminism, environmentalism, and the rise of the Christian Right transform American society and politics? Did larger tectonic shifts in the American economy alter political and social coalitions or did it simply reveal underlying rifts and cleavages?

This course examines cultural constructions of appetite and nourishment by asking: What are the processes through which humans have come to view plants and animals as food? How is edibility either celebrated or refused across time, space, and bodies? And most importantly, how are specific worldviews mobilized in understanding human encounters with the things that we eat?
