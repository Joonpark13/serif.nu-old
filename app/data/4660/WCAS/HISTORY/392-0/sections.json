These three sections will be bookended by an expository week on British society and government at the dawn of the twentieth century on one side, and a concluding week on the rise of Labour after 1945 and the construction of Britain's welfare state on the other. Along the way, we will focus on historiographical debates about the era's key themes and social transformations, including the nation's gradual political democratization, class relations, the changing position of women in society and politics, the development of a mass commercial leisure culture, and the tensions between rearmament, appeasement, pacifism, and internationalism. We will think carefully about how the major social and political transformations of these thirty years unfolded within the lives of ordinary Britons, how major structural changes in government, economics, and international relations manifested in the texture of everyday life experiences."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Two primary source analyses, two rotations as a principal commenter on others' primary source analyses, midterm exam, and a fifteen to twenty page final paper"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Jay Winter, The Great War and the British People, 9781403906953<br/>Robert Graves and Alan Hodge, The Long Week-End: A Social History of Great Britain, 1918-1939, <br/>9780393311365<br/>Angus Calder, The People's War, 978-0712652841"}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/392-0/37982", "instructor": ["Emily Dawn Vanburen"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37982", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"class_mtg_info": [{"meet_t": "MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM", "meet_l": "University Hall 121"}], "school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Topics In History", "title": "WCAS HISTORY 392-0-40 Topics In History", "lmod": "2/26/17 6:47 PM (CT)", "section": "40", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Philippa Ann Skotnes", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "Other Histories and the Limits of Archive", "course": "392-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/392-0/34270", "instructor": ["Philippa Ann Skotnes"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34270", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
