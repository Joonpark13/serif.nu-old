[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This survey traces the history of Latin America and the Caribbean from the Wars of Independence of the 1810s to the present. The course moves between political, social, environmental and cultural histories, interweaving thematic analysis with specific case studies from each region. Students will look at the big processes that shaped those histories: capitalism, development, revolution, dictatorship and dramatic environmental change. We will use novels, films, memoirs and intelligence files to explore the formation of modern societies, citizens and states against a backdrop of some of the earliest democracies and most unequal economies in the world. Knowledge of Spanish is useful but not mandatory.", "name": "History of Latin America in the Modern Period, 1789-present", "section": "1", "location": "Locy Hall 301", "topic": "", "course": "260-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/260-2/34411", "instructor": ["Paul James Gillingham"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34411", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
