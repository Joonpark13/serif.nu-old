The course moves between political, social, environmental and cultural histories, interweaving thematic analysis with specific case studies from each region. Students will look at the big processes that shaped those histories: capitalism, development, revolution, dictatorship and dramatic environmental change. We will use novels, films, memoirs and intelligence files to explore the formation of modern societies, citizens and states against a backdrop of some of the earliest democracies and most unequal economies in the world. Knowledge of Spanish is useful but not mandatory."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Considered and systematic Participation, Two Book Reviews, One Short Essay (6 pgs.), Midterm Exam, &amp; Final Exam"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Teresa A.
