The transnational historian's core belief is that the history of no nation on earth takes place in a vacuum; all nations have developed through their relationships with others. Therefore, the histories of countries such as the United States, Russia, Great Britain, India, Mexico, and many others in addition, have fundamentally been rewritten in a way that highlights their connections to the rest of the world. The profession's leading journal, The American Historical Review, has published dozens of articles with the word \"transnational\" in their title. New courses at universities around the globe have emerged, with titles such as \"Asia and the World,\" \"Africa and the World,\" the \"United States and the World,\" and \"Insert Name of Country Here and the World.\" As historians-in-the-making, your goal in this course is to gain an understanding of what has arguably been the most important scholarly trend in a generation; to assess whether transnational history is new or just the current iteration of older scholarly approaches; and to make sense of the global politics driving transnational history. You will do so by reading theoretical essays about transnational history, and examples of transnational scholarship by historians of the United States, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world.", "name": "Approaches to History", "section": "22", "location": "University Hall 312", "topic": "What is Transnational History?", "course": "393-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/393-0/34405", "instructor": ["Geraldo L Cadava"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34405", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In settler societies, Indigenous peoples must be recognized by the state as sufficiently authentic in order to have rights as legitimate Indigenous peoples. This constitutes a structural dilemma in which Indigenous people face considerable pressure to embody external stereotypes and racial expectations. In this seminar, we will engage with recent scholarship in Native American and Indigenous Studies that addresses indigeneity as a political status, a supposed biological category and frozen temporal/geographic state, and a social experience. Our readings will also engage feminist and queer perspectives on the problem of authenticity and we will devote attention to the appropriation of Indigenous culture by non-Indigenous people. Our primary focus will be on Anglophone settler states, especially the United States and Canada, but we will occasionally draw upon examples elsewhere in the world. Moreover, we will discuss indigeneity as a source of global affinity among colonized peoples and as a human rights framework within the United Nations.", "name": "Approaches to History", "section": "24", "location": "University Hall 101", "topic": "Real Indians: Indigeneity & the Authenticity Probl", "course": "393-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/393-0/34406", "instructor": ["Douglas   Kiel"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34406", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
