[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is in part about poverty, but it is even more about the ways Americans have thought about poverty and tried to combat it. We will explore two periods of U.S. history: 1890-1910 and 1960-1990. In each period we will examine the forces that impoverished individuals and families, the issues raised in explanations of poverty, the range of remedies proposed, and the ways they were justified. In both periods we will try to determine how Americans answered some lasting questions: How is poverty defined? Who among the poor deserves what kind of help? Does helping the poor promote dependence? What are the implications of poverty for the health of the nation as a whole?<br/><br/>The primary purpose of the course is to give students experience in some of the techniques employed by historians: close and critical reading of documents; reconstruction of the thinking of past actors and evaluation of their assumptions, motives, and options; and the production of clear, fair, and inclusive analyses of what happened. While the subject matter of the course has obvious relevance to present-day concerns, our primary goal is to think (and write) about the past.", "name": "First-Year Seminar-American History", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 3-410", "topic": "Anti-Poverty Crusades", "course": "102-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/102-6/34213", "instructor": ["Henry Claxton   Binford"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>Freshmen/Sophomores Only<br/><br/>", "id": "34213", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This freshman seminar explores the ways in which ordinary women entered both the political arena and the workforce during the twentieth century. Pushing beyond stereotypes of Rosie the Riveter and radical feminism, seminars will seek to answer how ordinary women, rich and poor, black and white, young and old, challenged the status quo. At times, these challenges could be categorized as political movements and other times women were simply living their lives, trying to make ends meet and survive as mothers, wives, and workers. Through speeches, memoirs, letters from the Newberry Collections, and excerpts from historical works, participants will discuss and analyze the ways ordinary women exercised rights and power through work and play, laying the groundwork for a movement of women who demanded not just the vote, but equal pay and recognition. Students will read and discuss the way women negotiated politics during the Temperance movement, how women entered the workforce, and the ways state benefits relegated many women to second-class citizenship. The class will investigate ideas about \"welfare queens,\" feminists, and women activists in 2017, questioning how women's political work may shape policy in the future.", "name": "First-Year Seminar-American History", "section": "22", "location": "University Hall 412", "topic": "Beyond Rosie the Riveter: Women, Wages and Politic", "course": "102-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/102-6/34214", "instructor": ["Ashley Campbell Johnson"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>", "id": "34214", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
