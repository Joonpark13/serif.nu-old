In each period we will examine the forces that impoverished individuals and families, the issues raised in explanations of poverty, the range of remedies proposed, and the ways they were justified.

At times, these challenges could be categorized as political movements and other times women were simply living their lives, trying to make ends meet and survive as mothers, wives, and workers. Through speeches, memoirs, letters from the Newberry Collections, and excerpts from historical works, participants will discuss and analyze the ways ordinary women exercised rights and power through work and play, laying the groundwork for a movement of women who demanded not just the vote, but equal pay and recognition. Students will read and discuss the way women negotiated politics during the Temperance movement, how women entered the workforce, and the ways state benefits relegated many women to second-class citizenship.
