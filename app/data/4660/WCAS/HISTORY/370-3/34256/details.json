The second half of the course focuses on the period since World War I. It examines the origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the significance of secular ideologies such as Arab nationalism and socialism, the successes and failure of the Nasser regime in Egypt, the rise of Islamism, the Iranian revolution, and the Middle East since the end of the Cold War."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture &amp; Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Midterm &amp; Final Exams"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "William L.
