[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this class, we will examine the history of South Africa's \"long 20th century,\" from c. 1870 to 1994. An overarching development during this period was the creation of an industrialized political economy based on the systematic denial of civil and political rights on the basis of race. But rather than view ordinary South Africans as passive victims, we will examine how their efforts to resist, subvert, and alter those trends were major forces in shaping modern South Africa, culminating in the overthrow of racial domination at the century's end.", "name": "History of South Africa, 20th century", "section": "1", "location": "University Hall 101", "topic": "", "course": "356-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HISTORY/356-2/34251", "instructor": ["Jonathon P Glassman"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34251", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
