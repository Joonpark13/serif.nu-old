Drawing on four different historical experiences and cases (the Armenian and Kurdish issues in Turkey, racism and white supremacy in the United States as well in as South Africa, and the colonial/post-colonial links between France and Algeria) this course examines the links among state structures, social class formation, and ethnic/racialized identity construction through a comparative lens. We begin by considering sociological conceptualizations of the state, boundary-making, ethnicity, and race. The cases of Turkey, France, Algeria, South Africa, and the United States -although crucially different from each other with respect to social, political, and economic structures- display remarkable similarities when analyzed through the concepts of power, privilege, violence, boundary-making, and modern governmentality. Having investigated concepts and ways of thinking about boundary-making and identities, we then turn to questioning the dynamics of power that operate at multiple and over-lapping levels: from the level of capitalist world-system to nation-state, from the state structures to local instances of ethnic/racial boundary making, from individual interests to individual strategies of ignorance and indifference."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Please contact the professor directly for more information."}], "lmod": "2/12/17 6:49 PM (CT)", "subject": "AFST"}]
