It will examine debates on the \"democratic recession\" and upsurge of authoritarianism, and draw on analyses of various regions, especially Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. After the Cold War, the number of democracies in the world increased significantly. In recent years, that number has stagnated and, by some accounts, declined. The aim of the course is to achieve a deeper understanding of these dynamics and their implications. It will be achieved by reading and discussing the works of leading scholars of these processes. Students will write a research paper on a country or region of their choice, apply these frameworks of analysis, and probe further the questions raised in the readings and in class. The first course reading is a comprehensive article by Michael J. Boyle, \"Illiberalism Ascendant: Obama's Tragic Legacy.\" (Current History, Jan. 2017) It captures the travails of western democracy and the \"liberal international order\". These commitments ebbed and flowed during the last century and are now more contested. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to several years of Western ideological hegemony. The spread of jihadist insurgencies, the 9/11 destruction of the World Trade Center, prolonged wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, and violent conflicts in many areas have shifted global priorities.

Nationalist authoritarianism in China and Russia, the rise and collapse of the \"Arab Spring\", mass migrations, and religious sectarianism have contributed to a sense of \"global disarray\". In recent years, scholars such as Christopher Walker debated the \"renewed struggle between democracy and authoritarianism worldwide\" (Journal of Democracy, 2016).

It will examine debates on the &quot;democratic recession&quot; and upsurge of authoritarianism, and draw on analyses of various regions, especially Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. After the Cold War, the number of democracies in the world increased significantly. In recent years, that number has stagnated and, by some accounts, declined. The aim of the course is to achieve a deeper understanding of these dynamics and their implications. It will be achieved by reading and discussing the works of leading scholars of these processes. Students will write a research paper on a country or region of their choice, apply these frameworks of analysis, and probe further the questions raised in the readings and in class.
