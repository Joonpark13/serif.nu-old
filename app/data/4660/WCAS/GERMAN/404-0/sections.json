More than half a century later, a vast body of fiction and non-fiction writing has been dedicated to recording, imagining, extrapolating from, and attempting to comprehend these catastrophic events. It has been argued that the Holocaust cannot be represented (aesthetic limitations), that it should not be represented (Bilderverbot/ban on graven images), and that it must be born witness to and never forgotten (ethical imperatives). So, what exactly is Holocaust writing? This course seeks to answer this question through the analysis of both canonical and lesser-known variants of autobiographical as well as fiction writing about and by Holocaust survivors, such as Primo Levi, Tadeusz Borowski, Jorge Semprun, Grete Weil, and Elie Wiesel. We will explore genres, styles, and tropes associated with Holocaust writing by examining the use of irony, satire, and hyperbole (Hans Keilson, Georges Perec), as well as the grotesque or even pornographic in fiction (Edgar Hilsenrath, Ka-Tzetnik 135633), through to the critical circumscription of the essay form (Jean Am\u00e9ry, Primo Levi, T.W. Adorno); up to its ongoing impact in the field of continental philosophy (Robert Antelme, Marguerite Duras, Sarah Kofman, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, Giorgio Agamben).
