[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Modern Yiddish secular culture, language and literature was all but destroyed in its Eastern European homelands by the Nazis. Thus, after the Holocaust, secular Yiddish literature and culture endured as a spectral haunted remnant, a branch severed from the trunk doomed to extinction.<br/><br/>This course examines Modern Yiddish Literature written before the Holocaust that is uncanny in its premonitions of disaster; Yiddish literature written during the Holocaust-especially The Warsaw and Vilna ghetto diaries; the outpouring of Yiddish literary responses to the Holocaust from immediately after the event to the end of the twentieth century.<br/><br/>The literature examined remains a dark continent for the majority of scholars of both the Holocaust and of modern Jewish culture. Thus, this course serves also as an introduction to a magnificent literature in its own right.", "name": "Yiddish Culture and the Holocaust", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 102", "topic": "", "course": "366-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/GERMAN/366-0/30908", "instructor": ["Marcus G Moseley"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "30908", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
