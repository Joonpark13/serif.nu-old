Wherever possible, critical readings will be related to specific Kafka texts, even where they are more general in character. The fascination of the authorial name - Kafka - will be juxtaposed to the complexity of the texts themselves, especially the narrative texts, on which the emphasis will be placed. Texts to be read include (the list is not exhaustive): 1. Kafka: Cares of a House Father; 2. The Hunter Gracchus; 3. Josefine, Songstress of the People of Mice; 4. &quot;The Great Theater of Oklahama (sic!),&quot; from The Man Who Disappeared (aka America); 5. Before the Law (and its insertion in The Trial). Critics to be read include: W. Benjamin (in connection with The Theater of Oklahama), Th. Adorno (The Castle), J. Derrida (Before the Law), M. Blanchot, Deleuze-Guattari.

The course should enable students to address better the question of whether reading in general and critical writing in particular should be considered to be co-constitutive of the text being read - and, if this is the case, then how the &quot;co-&quot; in &quot;co-constitutive&quot; should be conceived - and practiced?"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Class participation: Students will be asked to make short class presentations.<br/>Discussion: Part of each session will be devoted to discussion.<br/>Lecture: Individual meetings will be introduced either by a lecture or a student presentation, intended to st<br/>Presentations: Presentations are to be relatively short ? 15 minutes ? and designed to both focus and stimulate dis<br/>Readings: For each meeting specific readings will be assigned.<br/>Seminar: Part lecture-presentation, part discussion.
