Writing during the demise of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Jewish writer Kafka writing in German uniquely elaborated on the thematic of the empire, the center, and the periphery and presented distinct wounded, distorted, and deformed figures. This course explores the afterlife of Kafka`s literary thoughts in the works of global ?Kafkaesque` writers. This course begins with an examination of Kafka`s selected short stories. It then investigates the works of contemporary Kafkaesque writers including J. M. Coetzee`s Foe, Haruki Murakami`s Kafka on the Shore and the 2016 Man Booker Award winning novel Han Kang`s The Vegetarian. We will look into how the authors, writing from different cultural and literary-historical contexts, inherit Kafka`s legacy in their own creative and socio-critical ways. Students are invited to explore various cross-cultural intersections. We will examine, for instance, how Murakami, with a character named Kafka, `writes back` from modern Japanese literary history in regard to the reception of Western culture and modernist and realist literature, initiating a new form of contemporary popular literature."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Students will develop their reading, discussion, research, and writing skills in the humanities.
