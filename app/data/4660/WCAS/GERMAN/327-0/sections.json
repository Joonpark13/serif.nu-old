[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This class will look at the rise and fall of German Expressionism in literature, visual art, and film from the late nineteenth century to the ascent of the Third Reich. We will discuss how the artistic and technical innovations of Expressionism reflected distinctive political, philosophical, and social ideas and conditions of Germany in the years just before and in the wake of the first World War, looking closely at the aesthetics and poetics of this short-lived but influential movement. We will also consider certain themes and issues that Expressionist art particularly addressed, including: urbanization and cosmopolitanization; capitalism and inequality; war and trauma; portrayals of extreme states such as violence, ecstasy, and mental illness; sexuality, desire, and the representation of women; horror and the occult; the role of ethnic and cultural minorities; the appeal of the exotic; and the exploration of new or marginal psychological realities.", "name": "German Expressionism", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge 3354 German Seminar Rm.", "topic": "Modernity, Madness, Revolution", "course": "327-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/GERMAN/327-0/30900", "instructor": ["Erica Suzanne Weitzman"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "30900", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
