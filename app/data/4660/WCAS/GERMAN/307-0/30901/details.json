Topics will include German reactions to the Trump administration and, more generally, the picture of America and German-American relations that is presented in the media on that occasion. Furthermore, the &quot;refugee crisis&quot; of the last years will be addressed. Both Trump and the refugees will likely play a role in the upcoming parliamentary elections (federal and some states), which will be another topic. Last but not least, there will be ample room for students' suggestions as well as for current events which are not yet foreseeable. <br/>The class also aims to give students an overview of the German media landscape in general: Which newspapers and TV channels are suited to fulfill my information needs, and what else can I do to follow current developments in Germany?"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendanceClass participationPaper, finalPaper, mid-termQuizzes"}], "lmod": "2/20/17 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
