At the heart of our inquiry will be an interrogation of the relationship between representation and power. We will begin with a brief overview of how Arab culture and subjectivity has been represented in US, with a focus on the construction of stereotypes and media bias. We will then examine Arab-American cultural productions as forms of self-representation. Readings in postcolonial theory, women of color feminist theory, and queer of color critique will provide analytical lenses through which to explore the aesthetic and political aspects of Arab American arts and cinema. This course incorporates a field trip to a local Arab-American film festival and an assignment will be based on interdisciplinary research conducted at that event."}], "lmod": "2/21/17 6:49 PM (CT)", "subject": "MENA"}]
