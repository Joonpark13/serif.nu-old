All readings are in English translation and discussion is in English. Students who read French and/or Arabic will have the opportunity to read some materials in the original.<br/><br/>The starting point of the seminar is that novels, poems, short stories, plays, may reveal, with a lot of sensitivity and panache, not only personal realms but, sometimes unconsciously, what Jacques Lacan calls the \"subjectivity of an era\" or as Michel Foucault puts it the \"episteme.\" This seminar incorporates, in addition to liteary works, critical essays and Internet materials (webpages, videos) to explore what has been at stake in North African societies since the start of the 21st century, which corresponds roughly to the advent of social media. We will focus particularly on the relationship between fragmented representations of reality by masses of connected individuals and idiosyncratic expressions produced by literary actors. How do writers deal with the sudden popularization of speech and discourse online? Do they incorporate or employ different forms of speech within their texts? And how do users of social media\u00a0address or deal with \"elite\" literary froms? How does this new ecosystem of discourse production affect the literary world, in terms of content, format and communication? And finally, how do literary texts interact with collective upheavals, such as the 2011 uprisings, largely echoed and accelerated by social media?<br/><br/>Novels, plays, and poetry by authors including Yassin Adnane, Kamel Daoud, Abdelfattah Kilito, Laila Lalami, Leila Soliman, Youssef Zaidan.", "name": "Advanced Topics in Middle East & North African Studies", "section": "21", "location": "Kresge 4531 MENA Seminar Rm", "topic": "North African Literature in the Age of Social Medi", "course": "390-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/MENA/390-6/34446", "instructor": [""], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34446", "subject": "MENA"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Drawing on selected contemporary art and visual cultural practices in the contemporary Middle East, this seminar considers the ways in which visual, literary, architectural, and media cultures articulate a sense of place and belonging, especially in the near decade bracketed by 9/11 and the so called Arab Spring. We consider carefully the ways in which these practices speak to local histories and populations as well as to an international audience, and how they draw upon models of utopia, pan-regional politics, subterfuge, and resistance. We will try to determine how these efforts construct specific understandings of a \"Middle Eastern\" place, whether it be national, cultural, historical, or geographical. In each instance, however, we are less concerned with establishing a singular view regarding the \"reality\" of a place than with the ways in which its \"realities\" are constructed and represented culturally, historically, aesthetically, and temporally. Our analyses will be formed in dialogue with interdisciplinary theoretical and analytical texts ranging from art history to political science and anthropology, and we will, on occasion read artists' writings just as we will view their visual work. Topics range from transnational and regional identification, decolonization and anti-imperialism, neoliberalism and globalization, the artistic appropriation of archival traditions, images of state and so-called terrorist violence, public and private arts institutions, dis-placements and territorial control, the use of historical images in modeling visions of the present, and the remembrance of war. Our survey is not comprehensive in either geographical or art historical terms. Instead, we consider several case studies (mostly in the Levant) in order to analyze different ways by which places are imagined, dreamed, and sometimes destroyed across shifting regimes of power and authority.<br/><br/>Seminar is conversation based. Juniors and seniors are encouraged to enroll, but sophomores might want to contact the professor.
