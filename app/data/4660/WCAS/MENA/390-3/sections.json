[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What is territory? Is it simply the physical space (land, air or sea) over which a state exercises sovereignty? How does this presumed alignment of territory and sovereignty come about and get maintained in modern nation-states and internationally? Is territory a given and static contract or the terrain of constant contestation or negotiation in global and international affairs? This course examines these questions by proposing that territories are as much products of mobile social actors, contraband commodities and fluctuating values as they are of state policies aimed at managing these movements. Through reading anthropological and historical monographs as well as theoretical essays drawn from geography and social theory more broadly, in this course we explore the spatial production of social worlds and trace how this process has come to unfold at local, national and regional scales. By the end of the course students are expected to be well-versed in diverse theories of space and able to articulate what an attention to space and the relations of power inscribed in particular processes of territorial production can contribute to ethnographic and historical inquiry across the MENA region.", "name": "Advanced Topics in Middle East & North African Studies", "section": "21", "location": "Kresge 4531 MENA Seminar Rm", "topic": "Producing Territory: People, Commodities and Value", "course": "390-3", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/MENA/390-3/34441", "instructor": ["Emrah   Yildiz"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34441", "subject": "MENA"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Are some laws meant to be broken? Are those who break them all criminals? Where does the boundary between the legal and the criminal, the legitimate and the illicit, lie? Who gets to draw, manage and enforce that boundary that produces categories of crime out of illicit, illegal and illegitimate practices? Rather than seeing such activities as antithetical to the state, or as symptoms of the decline of the nation-state in the era of globalization, in this course we focus on when and how such relations may reinforce, work through and/or transform state power. We ask: How do licit and illicit networks and activities intersect to form different constellations of power and ideas of legitimacy, formality and legality in a given community at a given time? How do ideas and regimes of legality inform our ideas of what is morally right, criminal, and valuable? Drawing on political anthropology and cultural history, in this course we study many careers of the illicit in the MENA region to answer these questions. In so doing we trace the politics of legal and discursive constructions of crime and illicit action, and study how these practices interrelate with processes of law, governance, cross-border commerce and regimes of morality. At the end of the course we aim to reveal categories of crime and many careers of the illicit as historical and political constructs rather than as pre-existent and static categories of social action and analysis.", "name": "Advanced Topics in Middle East & North African Studies", "section": "22", "location": "Kresge 4531 MENA Seminar Rm", "topic": "Breaking the Law in the Middle East", "course": "390-3", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 5:00PM - 6:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/MENA/390-3/34442", "instructor": ["Emrah   Yildiz"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34442", "subject": "MENA"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "Advanced Topics in Middle East & North African Studies", "section": "23", "location": "Kresge 4531 MENA Seminar Rm", "topic": "Gender & Sexuality in the Middle East", "course": "390-3", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/MENA/390-3/34443", "instructor": ["Ayca   Alemdaroglu"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34443", "subject": "MENA"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "Advanced Topics in Middle East & North African Studies", "section": "24", "location": "Kresge 4531 MENA Seminar Rm", "topic": "Culture, Media, and Politics in Post-Revolutionary", "course": "390-3", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/MENA/390-3/34444", "instructor": ["Saeid   Golkar"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34444", "subject": "MENA"}]
