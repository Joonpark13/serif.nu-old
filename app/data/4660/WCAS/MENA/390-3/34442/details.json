Are those who break them all criminals? Where does the boundary between the legal and the criminal, the legitimate and the illicit, lie? Who gets to draw, manage and enforce that boundary that produces categories of crime out of illicit, illegal and illegitimate practices? Rather than seeing such activities as antithetical to the state, or as symptoms of the decline of the nation-state in the era of globalization, in this course we focus on when and how such relations may reinforce, work through and/or transform state power. We ask: How do licit and illicit networks and activities intersect to form different constellations of power and ideas of legitimacy, formality and legality in a given community at a given time? How do ideas and regimes of legality inform our ideas of what is morally right, criminal, and valuable? Drawing on political anthropology and cultural history, in this course we study many careers of the illicit in the MENA region to answer these questions. In so doing we trace the politics of legal and discursive constructions of crime and illicit action, and study how these practices interrelate with processes of law, governance, cross-border commerce and regimes of morality. At the end of the course we aim to reveal categories of crime and many careers of the illicit as historical and political constructs rather than as pre-existent and static categories of social action and analysis."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "?
