The hybrid, synthesized nature of sung theatrical arts require a complex set of analytical skills; students will become capable of articulating critical observations not just about dramatic content, but also productions, including music, choreography, and costume and set design. Part of this entails developing a sensitivity to the theatrical context: the theater venues, stages, audiences and patrons of the theater, as well as the performance conventions for actors. In addition to honing their interpretive critical apparatus, students will also incorporate knowledge gained from writings about theater by contemporaries and by historical figures from China, in order to produce a more nuanced assessment of theatrical practice in China."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "discussion-based seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Research-based, analytical theater review article 30%<br/>Screening Responses 25%<br/>Performance Review 20%<br/>Presentation 15%"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "1.
