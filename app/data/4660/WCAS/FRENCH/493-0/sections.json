[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Topics in Literary Theory: Bergsonism and Global Modernism. In the opening decades of the twentieth century, Henri Bergson was the most famous philosopher in the world. Although his early writings focused on debates about number (he was trained as a mathematician), space, and above all time, he later turned to such topics as evolution and the nature of life. His key terms were interpreted in wildly conflicting ways by different readers and rapidly became a central reference for not only philosophers, artists, and literary writers, but for many political thinkers as well.<br/><br/>This course explores the connections between Bergson as a philosopher of time, space, and life to some of the diverse Bergsonisms that evoked his philosophy to justify and energize their aesthetic and political agendas during the modernist period. After an introduction to Bergson's philosophical writings, we will concentrate on their uses in three different historical contexts: Parisian modernism of the interwar period (with a special emphasis on right-wing uses of Bergson); Japanese philosophy and cultural criticism from the same period; and writers associated with the n\u00e9gritude movement, from the late 1930s into the period of decolonization. Writers from the period may include Walter Benjamin, Wyndham Lewis, Nishida Kitaro, Kobayashi Hideo, Marcel Proust, Georges Sorel, and L\u00e9opold Senghor. Recent criticism may include Jimena Canales, Bachir Diagne, Mary Ann Doane, Donna Jones, and Stefan Tanaka.", "name": "Topics in Literary Theory", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge 5531 Comp Lit.
