This course offers a sustained engagement with the radical social analysis of Guy Debord and the International Situationists. Debord, who identified himself a strategist at war with the society he saw emerging in the late fifties and early sixties, worked in various domains and genres in an effort to provoke a realization and supersession of that society. We read his major works as well as major contributions to the development or comprehension of his analysis by other situationists, including Vaneigem, Vienet, and Becker-Ho, and we study most if not all of Debord's films. We also examine scholarly analyses of Debord's theoretical work by critics such as Jappe, Agamben, and Plant. Our aim is to understanding of Debord's social analysis in its socio-historical context in order to begin assessing its relevance to our own society, which Agamben has argued remains the ?society of the spectacle.'"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar.
