[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an introduction to the French \"roman,\" or novel, from the 12th to 20th centuries. Nature and the environment have been a constant in the history of the novel, and literary movements have defined themselves in relationship to nature and our shifting relation to our surroundings; the literary movements called naturalism or pastoralism are two examples. In this course we will trace the history of the many shifts in literary understandings and presentations of nature, the environment, and its influence on narrative and us. We will explore how the novel develops in relation to various environments, from dream allegory to the psychological novel, concluding with the postcolonial novel. What is the relation between the narrator and nature, between the narrator and the reader, and how does the environment within a novel frame or guide narrative and desire? The aim of this course is to familiarize students with various periods in the history of the development of the French novel as well as help them develop skills in reading and literary analysis. While the aim of the course is to introduce students to various periods in literary history, it also places emphasis on the ways in which genre and form shape these narratives. How does the use of literary devices move the narrative forward? How does the environment within a novel shape narrative and character development? And lastly, how is nature constructed in discourse? In beginning with medieval romance and ending with Marie Vieux Chauvet's account of life under dictatorship, we will explore the relation between the inside and out, between our internal world and its exterior, and analyze how human relationships with social, cultural, and \"natural\" environments frame desire, love, race and gender.", "name": "Introducing the Novel", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 3-410", "topic": "Nature, Desire, and the Novel", "course": "271-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/FRENCH/271-0/33856", "instructor": ["Joseph P Derosier"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33856", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
