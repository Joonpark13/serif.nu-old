[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is primarily concerned with the treatment of issues of gender and sexuality in the literary work of French writers of the mid-to-late 20th century. It aims to develop our skills in the close reading of literary works in relation to the literary and theoretical framework and the historical and social period in which they developed. To that end, we will read essays on feminine sexuality by Freud and Lacan, excerpts from Beauvoir's groundbreaking essay, The Second Sex, social and historical accounts of the period, analyses by feminist scholars, and novels by a range of writers including Leduc, Duras, and Guibert.", "name": "Gender & Sexuality", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 318", "topic": "", "course": "376-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/FRENCH/376-0/33860", "instructor": ["Jane Bradley   Winston"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33860", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
