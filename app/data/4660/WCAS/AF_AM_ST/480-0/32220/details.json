It focuses, primarily, on how genealogies of conquest, colonialism, occupation, white supremacist partriarchies, hetero-normativities, and global capitalism relate to and/or confirm one another. A major impetus will be to unsettle traditional and identitarian frameworks for analyzing oppression that are often diluted and domesticated by post-colonial, neo-liberal, nation-building, and capitalist imperatives. To this end, the CRD project sheds not only identitarian but also insular and nation-bound criteria. It marks how structural development or re-development (of modern nation states, many of which are also settler colonial nation states, in particular) has put racialized subjects positioned at different historical geopolitical locations in relation to each other, as well as how insurgent and transformative praxes and critiques are being conceived and fashioned between and across disparate populations."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "To facilitate an understanding of comparative, relational, and extra-national approaches to race"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Final Paper, Weekly Response Papers, Presentations, PARTICIPATION"}], "lmod": "2/7/17 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "AF_AM_ST"}]
