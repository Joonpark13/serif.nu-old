[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will introduce students to how the past is preserved and retold through archives and their absences. As an interdisciplinary course, we will investigate histories and theories of archives' construction and their function in societies. Our shared definition of an \"archive\" will range from repositories to memory to rituals to online outlets, and we will explore through discussions of how these different forms of preservation impact the histories that emerge from them. The course will conclude with an examination of different methods used for navigating the archive and its absences. The readings and discussions during those weeks will focus on recuperating the African diasporic past as a case study in those varying methods.", "name": "Topics in Transnational Black Studies", "section": "1", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-425", "topic": "Archives and Absences", "course": "381-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/AF_AM_ST/381-0/32188", "instructor": ["Melanie Lee Chambliss"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "32188", "subject": "AF_AM_ST"}]
