[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Chicago School Reform will examine the plans, the people and the possibilities surrounding the reform of Chicago Public Schools with special emphasis on how the restructuring of failing schools and opening new schools impact African-American students. The goal of this course is to give students an opportunity to see first-hand and up-close how (and why) new schools are created, who creates these schools, and what accounts for their success or lack thereof. This will be accomplished through visits to schools as well as presentations from and panel discussions with people directly engaged in Chicago school reform.", "name": "Professional Linkage Seminar", "section": "1", "location": "Harris Hall L28", "topic": "", "course": "394-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 4:00PM - 6:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/AF_AM_ST/394-0/32176", "instructor": ["Timothy J King"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "32176", "subject": "AF_AM_ST"}]
