The students start the year by working on reinforcing all the language skills attained the year before and building speaking skills/comprehension, as well as expanding the grammar and vocabulary. We do so by reading stories, doing movie assignments, playing games and making Microsoft Powerpoint presentations. Some of the topics that we touch upon during the year are stories from the Panchatantra, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Tales of Akbar and Birbal. We also touch upon the Mughal and pre-Mughal history, the Bhakti movement and Kabirdas' couplets in addition to other more contemporary poems and stories. <br/><br/>Note: Please purchase all the required textbooks in the fall quarter, as this is the only quarter that they are ordered during the year."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "C- or better in Hindi-Urdu 111-3 for Hindi-Urdu 121-1, Hindi-Urdu 121-1 for Hindi-Urdu 121-2, Hindi-Urdu 121-2 for Hindi-Urdu 121-3, and by placement test or with instructor consent."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Textbook, extra materials, movies."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "The students are graded on the basis of home assignments, weekly quizzes, 3 midterms, attendance and class participation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Advanced Hindi Grammar (2007) by U.
