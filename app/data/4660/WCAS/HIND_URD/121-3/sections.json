[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is a year long, three quarter sequence. The students start the year by working on reinforcing all the language skills attained the year before and building speaking skills/comprehension, as well as expanding the grammar and vocabulary. We do so by reading stories, doing movie assignments, playing games and making Microsoft Powerpoint presentations. Some of the topics that we touch upon during the year are stories from the Panchatantra, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Tales of Akbar and Birbal. We also touch upon the Mughal and pre-Mughal history, the Bhakti movement and Kabirdas' couplets in addition to other more contemporary poems and stories. <br/><br/>Note: Please purchase all the required textbooks in the fall quarter, as this is the only quarter that they are ordered during the year.", "name": "Hindi-Urdu II", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G28", "topic": "", "course": "121-3", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeThFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HIND_URD/121-3/32517", "instructor": ["Rami   Nair", "David Sol Boyk"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "32517", "subject": "HIND_URD"}]
