The third quarter of the sequence is organized around stories from the Shahnama. In addition to reading, memorizing, and reciting portions of Ferdowsi's text, we will read modern prose renditions of these stories, watch animations and TV shows based on them, and listen to scholarly interviews. Students will write their own summaries of the stories and analyze their historical, poetic, and ethical significance in a variety of written and oral exercises.", "name": "Persian II", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-335", "topic": "", "course": "121-3", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/PERSIAN/121-3/34425", "instructor": ["Austin Michael O'Malley"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34425", "subject": "PERSIAN"}]
