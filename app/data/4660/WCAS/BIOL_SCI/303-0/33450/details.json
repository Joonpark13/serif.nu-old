These molecules largely localize to synapses, remarkable structures where signaling gives rise to thought and behavior. This advanced seminar course focuses on molecular mechanisms and aberrations of synaptic signal transduction and drugs that target them. Introductory historical perspectives will be followed by consideration of contemporary issues. Class discussions focus on readings from the research literature."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Pre-requisites: NEUROSCI 202 and 306, or BIOL SCI 302 or 311."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lectures and seminar-style discussions of assigned readings, with optional term projects."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "READING: Handouts and readings available on-line."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Enrollment Requirements: Prerequisite: Students must have completed NEUROSCI 202 and 306, or BIOL SCI 302 or 311 to register for this course."}], "lmod": "2/6/17 8:38 AM (CT)", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
