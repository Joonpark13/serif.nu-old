[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Neuropsychopharmacology treats brain disorders by adjusting the activity of specific brain molecules. These molecules largely localize to synapses, remarkable structures where signaling gives rise to thought and behavior. This advanced seminar course focuses on molecular mechanisms and aberrations of synaptic signal transduction and drugs that target them. Introductory historical perspectives will be followed by consideration of contemporary issues. Class discussions focus on readings from the research literature.", "name": "Molecular Neurobiology", "section": "01", "location": "Technological Institute F280", "topic": "", "course": "303-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/303-0/33450", "instructor": ["Tracy M Hodgson"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "33450", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
