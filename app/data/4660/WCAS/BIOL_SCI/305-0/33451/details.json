Topics will be explored in 2-3 multi-week projects. Some of the experiments that are likely to be performed include: intracellular recording of the membrane potential in crayfish muscle; electroretinograms recorded from Drosophila photoreceptors; use of optogenetics to study synaptic plasticity at the neuromuscular junctions of transgenic Drosophila. The animals that may be used for these experiments may include crayfish, Drosophila and humans."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: Biol Sci 222, and 302 or 311"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "One hour discussion period on Mondays from 1:00pm-1:50pm, AND one 5-hour laboratory each week Wednesdays from 1:00pm - 6:00pm"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Written lab reports and class participation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Lab exercises posted on Canvas"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "value": "From Neuron to Brain by Nicholls, 4th Edition, 2001, ISBN: 0-87893-439-1, Sinauer publishers.<br/>Lab exercises posted on Canvas."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Mandatory discussion on Monday's 1-2:00 pm."}], "lmod": "2/6/17 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
