The first half of the course will: address the definitions, origins, and patterns of biological diversity; explore why the maintenance of biodiversity in natural (and unnatural) ecosystems is fundamentally important to the continued well-being of humans and other species; examine the context and causes of extinction. The second half of the course will deal with strategies and tactics for preventing or ameliorating the loss of biodiversity. Specific topics will include: the biology of small populations (including population viability analysis); the selection, design, and management of protected areas; ecological restoration; conservation design, legislation, and other higher-level strategies.", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Conservation Biology", "title": "WCAS BIOL_SCI 347-0-20 Conservation Biology", "lmod": "2/22/17 6:44 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-5098", "instructor_name": "Joseph S Walsh", "instructor_addr": "Hogan Hall, Room 6-110A"}], "topic": "", "course": "347-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Pre-requisite: Students must have completed either BIOL_SCI 215 or ENVR_SCI 202 and one course in Statistics to enroll in this course.", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Conservation biology is an integrated science based primarily on ecology, with important contributions from genetics, evolution, and biogeography, as well as nonbiological disciplines, including economics, politics and ethics.
