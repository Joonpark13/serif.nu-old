[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "How does the brain learn? This course examines what neurobiologists know about how brain cells, synapses, and circuits process experience to produce lasting changes in behavior. Lectures will involve in depth discussion of original research findings, from classic studies in invertebrates to the latest molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral studies in mammalian systems. Along the way, students will learn to think logically about the design and interpretation of neurobiological experiments.", "name": "Neurobiology of Learning and Memory", "section": "1", "location": "Pancoe Building Abbott Aud", "topic": "", "course": "326-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/326-0/33491", "instructor": ["Catherine S Woolley"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33491", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
