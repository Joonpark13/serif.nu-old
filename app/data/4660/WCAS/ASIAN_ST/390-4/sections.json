[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "There are few international relationships more important than the one forged between the United States and China over the course of two centuries. Sino-American relations have oscillated dramatically between profound hostility and warm friendship. This course will explore the historical evolution of that relationship from the rise of the American opium trade off the China coast in the nineteenth century, through the fraught relationship of the two allies during both World Wars, through the Cold War era of rivalry and rapprochement, to the present-day tensions roiling the South China Sea region. We will consider the bilateral Sino-American relationship in its larger global context and in connection to the issues of war, diplomacy, race, gender, religion, and material and popular culture. We also will pay particular attention to the ways that the international arena became integral to the domestic politics of both countries.", "name": "Adv Topics in Asian Studies", "section": "1", "location": "University Hall 121", "topic": "Sino-American Relations in the Modern World", "course": "390-4", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ASIAN_ST/390-4/38000", "instructor": ["Melissa A Macauley"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "38000", "subject": "ASIAN_ST"}]
