These racialized experiences of place and displacement have been theorized in Asian North American literature and other forms of storytelling. This course will focus on these stories to ask: How have Asian North Americans inhabited the earth through their difference? With topics ranging from citizenship, solidarity, food and resource use, globalization, environmental justice, and the future, these stories will challenge us to think globally as our planet may very well be moving closer to extinction."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation: 10%<br/>Exam, final: 30%<br/>Presentations: 15%<br/>Writing assignments: 45%<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "BOOKLIST IS TENTATIVE - PLEASE CONFIRM WITH INSTRUCTOR<br/>Alex Gilvarry, From the Memoirs of an Enemy Non-Combatant: A Novel (978-0679723288)<br/>Maxine Hong Kingston, China Men (978-0679723288)<br/>Chang-Rae Lee, On Such a Full Sea: A Novel (978-1594632891)<br/>Ruth L.
