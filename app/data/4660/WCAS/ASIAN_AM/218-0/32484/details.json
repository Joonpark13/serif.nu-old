How can we understand the tensions between these communities? And where can we find evidence of past solidarity and commonality? This course offers an interdisciplinary, chronological, and thematic examination of the construction Asian and Black peoples in the U.S by tracing their entrance and experiences. What are the economic, social, political, and ideological causes of tensions?and alliances? Topics include: the historical and overlapping racialization and sexualization of Blacks and Asians; slavery and early immigration legislation; international &quot;Afro-Asian&quot; connections. We then focus on WWII as a crucible of new racial and economic dynamics that differentially locate Blacks and Asians in the post-war economy. In the second half, we examine the impacts of the 1965 Immigration Act and the devastating?and bifurcated effect?of 1970s deindustrialization on Americans that led to the myths of the &quot;model minority&quot; and &quot;underclass.&quot; We study ideologies that emerged from social movements of the 1960s and 1970s and the results of the Vietnam War to theorize race and identity beyond Black and White to reconceptualize inter-minority relations."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "None."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Critical thinking, critical reading, critical listening skills.
