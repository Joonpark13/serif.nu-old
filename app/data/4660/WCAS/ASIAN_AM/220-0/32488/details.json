However, in this course, we will begin with the premise that what we know about ?Asian America' is founded and sustained by what might be called ?social movements,' mobilizations of people who have become conscious of an issue or issues that affect them and make them want to do something collectively about it. While reading some texts that I have assigned that give examples of Asian Americans engaging in the work of social movements, I propose that our task should be to evaluate whether these movements have been effective. To do that, we will also spend some time reading Gary Okihiro's Third World Studies in relation to the Brazilian educator Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed as a text that will help us to think about the actual operation of Asian American social movements. Weekly reflections will be required, as will a short midterm paper and a longer final essay."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "None"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation: 20%<br/>Paper, final: 40%<br/>Paper, mid-term: 30%<br/>Writing assignments: 10%<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Freire, Paulo.
