People usually seem far more familiar with the Orientalist tropes and cultural appropriation of some U.S. popular music, but in this course, we will examine the rich tradition that Asian American musicians have created across the 20th- and 21st-centuries as a form of expression, representation, and political critique. From the transformation of \"traditional\" folk songs, to the soundtracks of past and current Asian American activisms, to the rise of the Asian American YouTube generation, this class will examine the racial, cultural, and genre-based contexts that shape how Asian Americans make themselves heard through an intersectional lens.", "name": "Topics in Literary and Cultural Studies", "section": "1", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-425", "topic": "Asian American Music", "course": "276-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ASIAN_AM/276-0/32486", "instructor": ["Douglas Sadao Ishii"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "32486", "subject": "ASIAN_AM"}]
