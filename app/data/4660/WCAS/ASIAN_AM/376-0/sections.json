[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course focuses on Arab American film, visual art, literature, and performance as a way to examine various political, ideological, and social issues of concern to Arab American communities. At the heart of our inquiry will be an interrogation of the relationship between representation and power. We will begin with a brief overview of how Arab culture has been represented in the US and then move on to examine Arab American arts and cinema as forms of self-representation. Readings in postcolonial theory, women of color feminist theory, and queer of color critique will provide analytical lenses through which to explore the aesthetic and political aspects of Arab American arts and cinema. Note: the midterm assignment will be based on interdisciplinary research conducted at a local Arab American<br/>film festival.", "name": "Advanced Topics in Literary and Cultural Studies", "section": "1", "location": "University Hall 102", "topic": "Arab American Arts and Cinema", "course": "376-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ASIAN_AM/376-0/32490", "instructor": ["Umayyah Eleanor Cable"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "32490", "subject": "ASIAN_AM"}]
