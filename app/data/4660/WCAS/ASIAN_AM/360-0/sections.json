[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is situated at the intersection of theoretical, cultural, medical, and commercial online discourses concerning the burgeoning GCS-related surgeries (Gender Confirmation Surgery) presented online and conducted in Bangkok, Thailand. Using \"Trans\" theories: transgender, transnational, translation, spatio/temporal, this class discusses the intersections, dialogues, refusals, and adaptions when thinking about medical travel to Thailand. We will examine Thai cultural/historical conceptions of sex and gender, debates concerning bodies and diagnoses, and changes in presentations of sex/gender related surgeries offered online. Comparative cultural studies, medical discourses, and an archive of web images offering SRS surgeries to Thailand produced by Thais for western clientele will serve as axes for investigating this topic.", "name": "Studies in Race, Gender, and Sexuality", "section": "1", "location": "University Hall 102", "topic": "Med Tourism & Transn'l Sex'lty", "course": "360-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ASIAN_AM/360-0/32485", "instructor": ["Jillana B Enteen"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "32485", "subject": "ASIAN_AM"}]
