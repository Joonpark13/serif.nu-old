At the heart of it is an exploration of elements of drama, including scene, voice, language, and dramatic structure. An underlying idea is that drama is in some ways a &quot;game&quot; in that what happens on stage is not &quot;real&quot; but rather exists in a realm of persuasive imagining and enactment. And what are the &quot;games&quot; of interpretation that are enacted within drama-between and among characters, and between the performed play and its audience? Isn't theatre in part a game of interpretations involving the intimate (that is, the playwright's own investment of ideas, experience and feeling), the interpersonal (the relations between and among characters on stage) and the public (the audience's experience and its engagement with persons, feelings, and ideas)? Readings will include Withdrawal by Mohamed El Attar (Syria), Egyptian Products by Laila Soliman (Egypt), Clandestinopolis by Mustapha Benfodil (Algeria), and several works from the Europe and/or the Americas."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "This course is available to UNDERGRADUATES and GRADUATE students.
