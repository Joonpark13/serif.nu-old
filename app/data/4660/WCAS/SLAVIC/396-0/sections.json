[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course investigates the description, evaluation and representation of Asia in Russian writings of the 19th and the 20th century, with a specific focus on East Asia. We will engage with the notion of \"Russian orientalism\" in consideration of both the narrower and broader sense of the word: We will look at the development of Russian oriental studies and its relationship with the nation- and empire-building in Russian history. More importantly, we will read orientalism as a system of knowledge, opinions, judgments and hypotheses about Asia that was formed and transformed in the artistic, philosophical and journalistic writings by Russian authors. Questions to be discussed include: To what extent is Edward Said's idea of orientalism applicable to the history of Russian writings about Asia? Is it possible to talk about a \"Russian occidentalism\" that corresponds and counterbalances the orientalism? Does Russian orientalism draw a line between the orients within and without Russia? Authors to be read include: Vasilii Vasil'ev, Konstantin Leontiev, Vladimir Solovyov, Andrey Bely, Nikolai Gumilev, Velimir Khlebnikov, Boris Pilnyak, Sergei Tretyakov, etc.", "name": "Topics in Literature and Arts", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L28", "topic": "", "course": "396-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:00AM - 10:20AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/SLAVIC/396-0/34798", "instructor": ["Hui   Zhang"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34798", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
