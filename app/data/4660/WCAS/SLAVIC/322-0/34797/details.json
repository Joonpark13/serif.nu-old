This includes jargon (e.g., Wildcat, distros, CAESAR, CTECs, DM, ASG, SafeRide, MMLC, etc.) and slang. We focus on the language, identity, and heritage of the NU community. Students create the online dictionary &quot;WildWords&quot; https://nudictionary.mmlc.northwestern.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page documenting NU's language. They will learn to conduct, collect, and analyze the language as well as create the dictionary (sociolinguistic fieldwork and lexicography). They will study the role, status, and prejudice that book-dictionaries have had in history and work to try to avoid such prejudices."}], "lmod": "2/8/17 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
