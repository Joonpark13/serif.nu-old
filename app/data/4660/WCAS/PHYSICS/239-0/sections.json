[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course provides an introduction to the foundational principles that are required for a modern interpretation of physical systems. The key concepts of quantum physics are motivated from seminal experiments, both of the early 20th century and in the modern era. Major topics include the wave nature of light and matter, the probabilistic interpretation of wavefunctions, one-dimensional potentials, and tunneling. Applications of quantum theory to modern topics such as statistics and atomic structure are introduced. The course will strengthen problem solving skills and tools, including complex numbers, series, and differential equations, to build intuition in modern physics, which differs significantly from the familiar expectations of classical physics.", "name": "Foundations of Modern Physics", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute L168", "topic": "", "course": "239-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 12:00PM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/PHYSICS/239-0/37189", "instructor": ["Jens   Koch"], "class_attributes": "Natural Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "37189", "subject": "PHYSICS"}]
