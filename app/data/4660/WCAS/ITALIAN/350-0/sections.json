[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "New Media and Marxist Thought. The Italian Marxist tradition of Autonomia is probably the most influential branch of contemporary Marxism when it comes to new media theory - and more specifically when discussing processes of digitization, computerization, and networking. By engaging Marx's notion of the 'general intellect', Italian authors have linked such processes to the rise first of post-Fordism and later cognitive capitalism and financialization. Digital media and computer networks have been used as cases or examples of the transformations of capitalism in the age of immaterial labor and biopolitical production. Drawing the writings of Antonio Negri, Silvia Federici, Maurizio Lazzarato, and Christian Marazzi (among others), the course will ask what kind of perspective on contemporary digital media networks is enabled by Italian Autonomist Marxism.", "name": "Advanced Topics in Italian Culture and Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-430", "topic": "New Media and Marxist Thought", "course": "350-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ITALIAN/350-0/33882", "instructor": [""], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33882", "subject": "ITALIAN"}]
