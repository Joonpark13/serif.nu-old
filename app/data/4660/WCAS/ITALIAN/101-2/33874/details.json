At the end of full-year Italian 101 sequence, students will be able to ask and answer simple questions in Italian, write a grammatically correct sentence, and follow the drift of a simple conversation. Students will gain knowledge of fundamental aspects of Italian culture, history, and geography. The emphasis is on interpersonal communication. We build grammar skills by working on simple situations that grow in complexity as we proceed: greetings, talking about ourselves, asking others, performing tasks.
