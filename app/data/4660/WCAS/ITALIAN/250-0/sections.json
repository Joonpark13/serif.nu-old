The unification of Italy in the latter half of the nineteenth century has brought with it the unresolved 'Southern Question', that is the notion that a fundamental difference exists between the North and the South of Italy. This difference is mapped onto a series of binary oppositions between European/non-European; civilized/primitive; backward/progressive, industrial/agrarian and so on. Recent scholarship on the Southern Question, however, has taken issue with the master narrative of development that underlies such oppositions and criticized its politics of representation. Drawing on Marx, Gramsci, Foucault, and postcolonial theory, such scholarship has located Southern Italy within a larger global South, while also raising issues of representation and popular culture. The course will thus look at: recent writings about the history of unification; Mediterranean culture as space of flows and contaminations affecting food, music, etc.; popular fictions about organized crime (for example the TV series Gomorrah and Montalbano); popular music (the new Neapolitan wave or the Afro sound of Naples; the neo-melodic genre; Sicilian and Pugliese Reggae); social movements (the revolts around the rubbish crisis; policing the underclass; migration and de-industrialization;)", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Topics in Italian Culture and Literature", "title": "WCAS ITALIAN 250-0-20 Topics in Italian Culture and Literature", "lmod": "2/24/17 6:50 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "Introduction to Marxism and Postcolonial Studies", "course": "250-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Introduction to Marxism and Postcolonial Studies.
