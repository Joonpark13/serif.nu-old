[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Reading Elena Ferrante: The Reinvention of Friendship, Love, and Motherhood. In 2016, Time magazine included the Italian novelist who works under the pseudonym \"Elena Ferrante\" on its list of the year's hundred most influential people. How did this happen? To answer this question, we will explore some of the most celebrated novels of this mysterious writer, who is beloved not only in Italy but also in the US and around the world. Critics in The New York Times, The New Yorker, N+1, The London Review of Books, and numerous other publications have given ecstatic reviews to her writings, typically describing their effect as \"mesmerizing,\" \"stunning,\" and \"brutally honest.\" Indeed, Ferrante's fearless, clich\u00e9-annihilating explorations of friendship, loneliness, troubling loves, sexuality, violence, and maternity suggest a creative and disruptive refashioning of traditional feminist concerns on an epic scale. We begin our consideration of her work with The Days of Abandonment, which revises the trope of the abandoned woman in new and startling ways. The genealogy of this trope will be a key topic, starting with the mythical story of Dido's abandonment by Aeneas and encompassing modern examples such as de Beauvoir's The Woman Destroyed as well as the contemporary film adaptation of Ferrante's novel itself. We will then read The Lost Daughter, the novelist's sophisticated and uncanny investigation of the agonized ambivalence of motherhood. Finally, the course concludes with My Brilliant Friend, the first volume of her bestselling series of Neapolitan novels. In particular, we will focus on how this text redefines the contested territory of women's friendship and completely overturns the pop-culture conventions of narrative paradigms such as Sex and the City. Throughout, we will address Ferrante's decision to keep her true identity secret, thus setting in motion the media's frenzy to unmask her.", "name": "Major Figures in Italian History and Culture", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 214", "topic": "", "course": "370-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ITALIAN/370-0/33896", "instructor": ["Alessia   Ricciardi"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33896", "subject": "ITALIAN"}]
