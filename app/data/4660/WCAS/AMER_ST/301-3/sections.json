[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course stages a conversation among blackness, Latinidad and sexuality by examining the work of<br/>black and brown artists in the black diaspora. Using \"blacktino\" as the framing device, the course will<br/>highlight how these artists index the specificities of black and brown social and political relations, while<br/>also waging a broader queer-of-color critique of institutionalized racism and homophobia. Students will<br/>engage these artists' work on various levels, including textual analysis, embodied experience, critical<br/>reception, and site specific engagement.*<br/><br/>*The class includes a mandatory experiential learning trip to New York City (May 26-29, 2017). Travel expenses will<br/>be subsidized for all enrolled students.", "name": "Seminar for Majors", "section": "20", "location": "Wirtz 235 Seminar Room 1", "topic": "Blacktino Performance", "course": "301-3", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/AMER_ST/301-3/30844", "instructor": ["Elondust   Johnson", "Ramon H Rivera-Servera"], "class_attributes": "Permission of department<br/><br/>", "id": "30844", "subject": "AMER_ST"}]
