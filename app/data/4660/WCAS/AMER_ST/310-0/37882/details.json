Readings will focus on the intersections between health and environment, gender, race, law, and region. We will consider questions such as what's the impact of environmental change in transforming medical, scientific, and lay understanding and experience of health and illness? What's the role of illness in shaping changing perceptions of the environment? How has race been central to the construction and treatment of disease? How has gender shaped conceptions of and approaches to health? What historical role have issues of gender, race, and class played in the inequitable distribution of pollution and in activist involvement in combating environmental hazards? How has changing food production and culture shaped health? This course assumes no previous coursework in the field, and students with a wide variety of backgrounds and disciplines are encouraged to participate."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Toxic Bodies: Hormone Disruptors and the Legacy of DES 9780300171372<br/><br/>Inescapable Ecologies: A History of Environment, Disease, and Knowledge 978-0-520-24887-8<br/><br/> America + The Pill 978-0-465-02459-9<br/><br/>Precarious Prescriptions: Contested Histories of Race and Health in North America 978-0-8166-9047-3"}], "lmod": "2/21/17 6:43 PM (CT)", "subject": "AMER_ST"}]
