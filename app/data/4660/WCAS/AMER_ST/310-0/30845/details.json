Singer, Grace Paley, Bernard Malamud, Cynthia Ozick, Saul Bellow, Lore Segal, Philip Roth, Rebecca Goldstein , Jonathan Safran Foer, and Woody Allen, who have reshaped the Jewish tradition of storytelling to their own individual talents. Learning Objective(s): To encourage students to read critically and write clear, coherent, persuasive prose; to participate in class discussions, and to understand and appreciate the writing of modern American Jewish writers who echo and transform Jewish storytellers of the past.
