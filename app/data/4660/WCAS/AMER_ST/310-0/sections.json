[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Course Description: The achievement of a select group of American Jewish writers is dependent in in large measure on the way in which their writing reveals a Jewish past. Their treatments of Jewish tradition and Jewish history are the particulars which, paradoxically often give their best work its most distinctive claim to universality. This course will focus on stories by American Jewish writers such as Anzia Yezerska, I.B. Singer, Grace Paley, Bernard Malamud, Cynthia Ozick, Saul Bellow, Lore Segal, Philip Roth, Rebecca Goldstein , Jonathan Safran Foer, and Woody Allen, who have reshaped the Jewish tradition of storytelling to their own individual talents.

Readings will focus on the intersections between health and environment, gender, race, law, and region. We will consider questions such as what's the impact of environmental change in transforming medical, scientific, and lay understanding and experience of health and illness? What's the role of illness in shaping changing perceptions of the environment? How has race been central to the construction and treatment of disease? How has gender shaped conceptions of and approaches to health? What historical role have issues of gender, race, and class played in the inequitable distribution of pollution and in activist involvement in combating environmental hazards? How has changing food production and culture shaped health?
