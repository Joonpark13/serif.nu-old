[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Medical pluralism-therapeutic landscapes within which multiple healing forms exist simultaneously-is largely the norm throughout many places in the world, and in those places, patients may choose healers or non-biomedical therapies instead of biomedical care, or in conjunction with this care. This seminar course explores a diversity of so-called `indigenous' medical systems and forms of healing around the world, and their significance within the places where global health initiatives are often implemented or where biomedical supremacy is assumed. Drawing on mostly contemporary examples, this course will explore healing encounters in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and also in Europe and North America that involve so-called `indigenous' or `traditional' medicine. Questions we will explore include: Why do patients choose `indigenous' medicine over biomedicine? Why do these so-called `traditional' medical practices and healers endure despite public health and biomedical interventions? How do non-biomedical therapeutic practices approach the body, illness, health, and healing? How has globalization impacted how, where, and among whom these healing forms are practiced?", "name": "Global Health & Indigenous Medicine", "section": "1", "location": "Locy Hall 106", "topic": "", "course": "305-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 12:30PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/GBL_HLTH/305-0/33940", "instructor": ["Noelle   Sullivan"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>No Freshmen<br/><br/>", "id": "33940", "subject": "GBL_HLTH"}]
