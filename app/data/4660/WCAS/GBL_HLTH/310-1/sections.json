[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "One of the recent Millennium Development Goals was to improve maternal health, in particular, to decrease maternal mortality in part by increasing attendance of births by skilled health practitioners and to achieve universal access to reproductive health. These goals were to have been met by 2015, and began in 1990; however, concerns regarding skilled birth attendants and women's access to birth control began well before 1990. In this class, we will consider the historical roots of what remain contemporary problems: women having access to skilled birth attendants and birth control options in order to space, limit, or prevent having more children. This course will spend the week of spring break doing archival research at the Wellcome Library and Archives in London. We will then meet during the spring quarter for a seminar with the end result being a major paper written by each student using as its basis the research done at the Wellcome Library.", "name": "Supervised Global Health Research", "section": "1", "location": "University Hall 112", "topic": "Maternal Health in the 20th Century", "course": "310-1", "meeting_time": ["We 10:00AM - 12:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/GBL_HLTH/310-1/33935", "instructor": ["Sarah B Rodriguez"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33935", "subject": "GBL_HLTH"}]
