[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course introduces students to the theoretical underpinnings of qualitative research methods and develops the practical skills necessary to conduct rigorous qualitative field research on global health topics. Through seminar-style discussions, small-group workshops, and out-of-class research exercises, students will become familiar with how qualitative methods are applied at each stage of the research process, including design, data collection, analysis, and write-up. Throughout the class, we will consider the ethical dilemmas and methodological challenges that confront qualitative researchers working in global health. Students should note that this course demands significant time and attention: not only in regards to reading assigned selections, participating actively in class discussions, and providing meaningful and constructive feedback to peers, but also in planning, conducting, analyzing, and writing up out-of-class research exercises.", "name": "Qualitative Research Methods in Global Health", "section": "2", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-325", "topic": "", "course": "320-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 12:30PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/GBL_HLTH/320-0/33938", "instructor": ["Peter Andrew Locke"], "class_attributes": "No Freshmen<br/><br/>", "id": "33938", "subject": "GBL_HLTH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The course tacks between understanding the theoretical underpinnings of qualitative approaches and the development of practical skills necessary to conducting rigorous qualitative research on global health topics. Students will become familiar with qualitative research not only through seminar-style discussion and workshop exercises, but also by \"doing\" research through a series of assignments. This course will provide an introduction to the landscape of health-related qualitative research practice, including design, data collection, analysis, and write-up. Throughout the class, we will discuss the ethical dilemmas and methodological challenges that face qualitative researchers working in global health at each step in the process. Methods students will learn include: writing ethnographic fieldnotes, qualitative semi-structured interview techniques, focus groups, life histories, coding and analysis.", "name": "Qualitative Research Methods in Global Health", "section": "3", "location": "University Hall 418", "topic": "", "course": "320-0", "meeting_time": ["We 1:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/GBL_HLTH/320-0/33939", "instructor": ["Noelle   Sullivan"], "class_attributes": "No Freshmen<br/><br/>", "id": "33939", "subject": "GBL_HLTH"}]
