[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Participants will read and translate medieval Latin texts ranging from the Vulgate (Latin Bible) to a wide selection of literary, historical, and religious works in verse and prose. Each session will be devoted to a mixture of grammar review, sight-reading, and correction of written translations prepared beforehand. There may also be some English-to-Latin exercises. Students taking the course for credit will hand in an assigned translation every week; auditors will prepare translations for oral review, but need not hand them in. Full-credit students will also work throughout the quarter on individual translations related to their research interests. The length and difficulty of the texts chosen will depend on the student's prior degree of proficiency in Latin. Finished translations should be in the range of 5-8 double-spaced pages. Grades will be based on oral performance in class, weekly written assignments, and the final translation project (33% each).", "name": "Medieval Latin", "section": "1", "location": "Allison Residential Comm 1021", "topic": "", "course": "400-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/LATIN/400-0/32727", "instructor": ["Richard   Kieckhefer"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "32727", "subject": "LATIN"}]
