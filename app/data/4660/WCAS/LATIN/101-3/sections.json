[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Elementary Latin provides a thorough introduction to the language, literature and culture of the Roman world. It helps lay the foundation for further study of western culture as well as Medieval Latin, Renaissance Latin, and other Romance languages. Latin 101-3 is the third quarter of the year-long Elementary Latin course designed to introduce students to the basic principles of classical Latin grammar and syntax. In addition to the mastering of these basic tools, the course will focus on vocabulary acquisition and the development of sight translation skills and reading competency necessary to continue successfully in the second year. During the first three weeks of the quarter, class meetings will be devoted to completing chapters 34-40 of Wheelock's Latin. For the rest of the term, primary Latin readings from Cicero's First Catilinarian Oration will be assigned on a daily basis. Students will be expected to develop their translation skills in prepared passages and in sight-reading exercises.", "name": "Elementary Latin", "section": "21", "location": "Parkes Hall 213", "topic": "", "course": "101-3", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeTh 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/LATIN/101-3/32693", "instructor": ["Graziela Marieta Byros"], "class_attributes": "Specific requirements in the language<br/><br/>", "id": "32693", "subject": "LATIN"}]
