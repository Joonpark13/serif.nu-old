The main topics of discussion will be how meaning and emphasis are communicated in Latin.<br/>Though Latin 201-3 concentrates on language skills, it also develops skills of analysis that are foundational for the future study of literature in any language."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "PREREQUISITES: Successful completion of Latin 201-2, OR by placing into Latin 201-3 through the online Latin Placement Test.
