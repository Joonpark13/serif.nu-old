[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Latin 310 - Augustine's Confessions <br/><br/>Augustine led a checkered youth, a whirlwind tour of the cultured, God-fearing and wacky world of late Roman society. In the first nine books of his Confessions he tells this story to God in lyrical Latin prose of unsurpassed beauty. We hear about his infancy and schooling; how he fell into the uttermost sinful depravity; his turmoil in the fleshpots of Carthage; his time with the Manicheans, a forgotten world-religion devoted to the belching of divine light; his teaching at Rome and post as orator at the Imperial court in Milan; his philosophical journey back to Christianity and dramatic conversion under a fig tree; his bibulous and devoted mother. But after his narrative, Augustine surprises the reader with a new agenda. The tenth book is a treatise on memory. The last three books are a commentary on the first words of Genesis. So the Confessions is beautiful, moving but a puzzle: what is its structure, what is its message, why did Augustine write it and for whom? We will read narrative sections in the original, the whole in translation, and try to answer these questions with help from some modern criticism.", "name": "Readings in Latin Literature", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 118", "topic": "Augustine's Confessions", "course": "310-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/LATIN/310-0/32696", "instructor": ["John P F Wynne"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>Reading in the language, discussion in English<br/><br/>Specific requirements in the language<br/><br/>", "id": "32696", "subject": "LATIN"}]
