[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, we will look into the many different facets of the economics of gender. We will study economic decisions that individuals and households face from a unique gender perspective. The topics we will cover include, among others: the status of women around the world, education, marriage, fertility, labor supply, household decision-making, and discrimination. The class will put an emphasis on applied microeconomic theory and empirical analysis. A combination of econometric techniques and theoretical models will feature prominently in the course. For each topic, we will study concrete examples emanating from all over the world, and make an intensive use of statistics and econometrics. We are also very much interested in understanding the relationship between research and public policy. By the end of the quarter you hopefully will have a solid microeconomic framework within which to analyze important issues in economics from a gender perspective.<br/><br/>There will be a series of empirical papers to read for this course. These papers will be discussed in lecture and they should be prepared prior to class. Preparing the paper means reading the abstract, introduction and conclusions (not necessarily the body of the paper) to understand:<br/>1. What is the paper's research question?<br/>2. What methodology is used to answer the question (e.g., an experiment, a quasi-experiment, a set of correlations, etc)?<br/>3. What are the main findings?<br/>4. What is the economic interpretation of these findings?", "name": "Economics of Gender", "section": "20", "location": "Pancoe Building Abbott Aud", "topic": "", "course": "342-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ECON/342-0/35370", "instructor": ["Sara   Hernandez"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35370", "subject": "ECON"}]
