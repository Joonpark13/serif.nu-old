The energy sector is a vital input to the economy. It is often highly concentrated, generating concerns about competition, and a big emitter of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, generating concerns about the environment. As a consequence, the energy sector is subject to substantial economic and environmental regulation. We will use economic theory and empirical evidence to analyze the real-world operation of electricity, oil, and natural gas markets. These tools will allow us to critically understand how these markets are regulated. We will examine policies in a range of current topics. For example: Why has the performance of electricity markets been debated? Who pays the bill of carbon regulation? What are the pros and cons of renewable energy policies? What are the prospects for energy efficiency improvements? The course will draw upon material taught in Economics 310-1, 310-2, and 281, with the tools from Econ 310-1 and 281 being absolutely essential.", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Economics of Energy", "title": "WCAS ECON 371-0-20 Economics of Energy", "lmod": "2/26/17 6:45 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Mar   Reguant Rido", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "371-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "The goal of this course is to understand the functioning and regulation of energy markets.
