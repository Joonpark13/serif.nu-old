We will first discuss the nature and functions of money. We will then build on the simple IS-LM model of intermediate macro, moving towards a more sophisticated view of monetary policy. This move will encompass such topics as the microfoundations of money demand; the Federal Reserve's ability to control monetary aggregates, the predictive power of bond prices and the effect of imperfect information on bank lending. We'll also consider the causes of hyperinflations, the appropriate goals for monetary authorities and the recent financial crisis."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Econ 201, 202, 281, 310-1, 311, Math 220, Stat 210.
