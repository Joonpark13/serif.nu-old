[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course focuses on macroeconomic aspects of development economics, and deals mainly with historical and long term patterns of economic development. This is such a fundamental issue in economics that Adam Smith even made it the title of his book, \"The Wealth of Nations.\" The main questions we ask are \"How can economies grow or fail to grow?\" \"What explains the difference in the income levels and growth performances across countries?\" No one can claim to have the answer to these difficult questions (and don't trust anyone who claims to know the answer). However, economic theories tell us what are important determinants of long run growth and development performances. More specifically, we will discuss the roles of investment (i.e., physical capital accumulation), of education (i.e., human capital accumulation), of technological change (i.e., knowledge capital accumulation through innovation and R&D), of income distribution, of population growth and demographic change, and others.", "name": "Economic Growth & Development", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute L251", "topic": "", "course": "325-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ECON/325-0/35325", "instructor": ["Kiminori   Matsuyama"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35325", "subject": "ECON"}]
