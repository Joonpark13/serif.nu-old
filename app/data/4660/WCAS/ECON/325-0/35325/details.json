This is such a fundamental issue in economics that Adam Smith even made it the title of his book, &quot;The Wealth of Nations.&quot; The main questions we ask are &quot;How can economies grow or fail to grow?&quot; &quot;What explains the difference in the income levels and growth performances across countries?&quot; No one can claim to have the answer to these difficult questions (and don't trust anyone who claims to know the answer). However, economic theories tell us what are important determinants of long run growth and development performances. More specifically, we will discuss the roles of investment (i.e., physical capital accumulation), of education (i.e., human capital accumulation), of technological change (i.e., knowledge capital accumulation through innovation and R&amp;D), of income distribution, of population growth and demographic change, and others."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Econ 310-1, and 310-2 (recommended) or the permission of the instructor"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Two lectures and one TA session each week"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Two exams, each counts for 50% of the total grade."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Development Economics, by Debraj Ray, 1998 (ISBN: 978-0691017068) Lecture slides and some supplementary reading materials will be posted."}], "lmod": "2/21/17 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "ECON"}]
