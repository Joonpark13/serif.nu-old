Topics covered include the economics of marriage and divorce, bargaining within the household, household production, and the economics of fertility. The specific questions addressed by the course fall into two categories. One the one hand, the course uses economics to understand the family, such as who marries whom, and how many children (if any) people choose to have. On the other hand, the course also considers the wider implications for family decisions for the economy at large, such as the repercussions of assortative mating in marriage for inequality in a society, and the relevance of family decisions for long-run economic development."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "310-1"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Two 80-minute lectures per week"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "3 problem sets/class projects (40 percent), midterm exam (20 percent), and final exam (40 percent)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "No textbook needed.
