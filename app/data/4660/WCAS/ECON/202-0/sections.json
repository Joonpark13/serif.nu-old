[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is an introductory course that covers the fundamentals of microeconomics. We will study the behaviour of individuals and firms in a world of limited resources, and the interactions between the two in many different markets. With an emphasis on economic principles, students will be introduced to core terminology and modes of analysis for studying the production and distribution of goods and services in the economy. An overarching goal is to gain insight into how, when, and why markets fail or succeed. Specific topics include supply and demand, market equilibrium, elasticity, costs of production, different degrees of competition (including perfect competition and monopoly), and government interventions (price controls, taxes).<br/><br/>You will get started thinking about the three fundamental questions in economics: (i) what goods and services should be produced?,?(ii) how do we produce those goods and services?, and (iii) who gets those goods and services?<br/><br/>This course is aimed at potential economics majors and students who are curious about having a better understanding of the popular press, or analyzing and comparing different government policies.", "name": "Introduction to Microeconomics", "section": "20", "location": "Leverone Auditorium Owen Coon", "topic": "", "course": "202-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ECON/202-0/35274", "instructor": ["Sara   Hernandez"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "35274", "subject": "ECON"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Formally, economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources among competing ends. Informally, economics helps us understand how household, business and government decision makers respond to incentives; the importance of proper-functioning markets in a modern capitalist economy; and the role of government in alleviating various market failures. Microeconomics focuses on individual decisions (typically using cost-benefit analysis) and the inner workings of specific markets. Picking up where macroeconomics left off, this course will introduce the principles of microeconomics and teach you how to apply these concepts to real world scenarios. Thus, this course is aimed not only at potential economics majors, but also at any student who desires the ability to understand the popular press, critically analyze government policies, and use microeconomics to make better choices as a consumer, producer, representative, or voter.", "name": "Introduction to Microeconomics", "section": "40", "location": "Tech Institute Lecture Room 3", "topic": "", "course": "202-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ECON/202-0/35275", "instructor": ["Laura Lynne Kiesling"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "35275", "subject": "ECON"}]
