[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In most markets, firms compete for customers by making profit-maximizing decisions about prices, capacity, location, quality, variety, investment and product innovation. These decisions are especially interesting when there are several firms with interdependent payoffs; e.g., the choice of one firm to cut its price or close a retail store affects not only its profits, but also rival firms' profits. Inspired by both classical and modern readings about strategy, we develop and employ game theory tools to study firm behavior in a variety of scenarios, beginning with static (one period) models, and then turning to dynamic settings, in which firms may pursue profits through mergers, R&D investments, or the timing of a product launch. We also explore pricing schemes as well as tactics managers might use to modify the business environment in ways that enhance their firms' long-run profits. E.g., a firm may try to drive rivals out of the market, keep potential rivals from entering the market, or cooperate with rivals - strategies that may dampen competitive forces and possibly run afoul of antitrust laws.", "name": "Business Strategy", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G15", "topic": "", "course": "249-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ECON/249-0/35374", "instructor": ["James Andrew Hornsten"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35374", "subject": "ECON"}]
