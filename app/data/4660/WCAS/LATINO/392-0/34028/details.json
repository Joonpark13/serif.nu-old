Demographers forecast that within the century, this population will reach close to 100 million. Considerable popular and academic debate has ensued about the meaning and significance of these demographic trends. For some, Latino population growth represents a major domestic threat, and for others it is a beneficial and welcomed development. Implicated in these debates, but rarely discussed, is the sociohistorical and political process by which diverse and heterogeneous Latin American-descent communities came be imagined and understood as comprising a panethnic whole. In this course, we will examine this process with an analytic focus on the intersection of politics, race, and knowledge production."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "?
