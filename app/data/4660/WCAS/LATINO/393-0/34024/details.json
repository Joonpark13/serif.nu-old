In this course, we will examine how and why Muslim identity and Islamic culture have been marginalized within Latino culture and society despite their strong influence, as revealed by historical, cultural, and social evidence. This course will explore four historical moments of Islamic cultural and religious influence on Latinos/as in the Americas that include: 1) Islamic Culture in Moorish Spain, 2) Arab and Islamic Migrations to the Americas, 3) African American Islam, and 4) Islamic Conversions after 9/11. The following questions will guide our examination of these historical periods: How has Islam influenced Latino/a culture and society and why are these influences erased or forgotten by most Latinos/as in their Westernized lives? How did Latino/a Catholic identity come to be figured as normative and opposed to Muslim identity? What does it mean for Latinos/as to remember and claim their Islamic heritage within a Judeo-Christian national order, especially after 9/11? In the final section, the class will examine scholarship, literature, and art produced by Latino/a Muslims to compare the ways individuals and groups express their racial, cultural, social and religious identities and challenge rigid notions of Latino identity."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "critical thinking of U.S. empire, (self-)orientalism and decolonization of Latinxs in the Western Hemisphere and Latin/o America."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Class participationDiscussionField tripsFilms / videosGuest speakersOnline workReadings"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendanceClass participationExam, mid-termOnline workPaper, finalQuizzes"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Moorish Spain <br/><br/>Shohat, Ella. &quot;The Moorish Atlantic: Orientalism/Occidentalism between the Middle East and the Americas.&quot; Eds.
