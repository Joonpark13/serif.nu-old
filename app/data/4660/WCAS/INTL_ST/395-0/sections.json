They are encouraged to think critically about the variety of empirical domains in which global inequality manifests (e.g., access to healthcare and education; sovereigns' ability to borrow at favorable interest rates; the unequal distribution of the effects of climate change); the sources of these forms of inequality and the ways in which they are perpetuated; and the ethical implications of living in an unequal world. Each week will pair a set of readings on a substantive facet of global inequality (e.g., historical origins, institutions, trade, development and aid) with a research skill (e.g., formulating a research question, constructing a thesis statement and using evidence to support your argument, incorporating multiple perspectives). The readings will provide students with background relevant to their research papers, and serve as examples of essential components of a research project. Lecturing will be limited to instruction about the process and expectations for writing a research paper, and each week will involve a seminar-style discussion of the readings, as well as extensive opportunities for partner and peer workshopping of students' papers from start to finish"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Milanovic, Branko (2016) Global Inequality: A New Approach for the Age of Globalization.
