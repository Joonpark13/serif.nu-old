We will examine various forms of captivity, servitude, and slavery-from the ancient world to the New World-we will explore competing and sometimes overlapping ideas and practices of slavery, look at debates about the nature and meaning of slavery, consider how iterations of the ideologies and practices of slavery and servitude manifested in sites less familiar in the American imagination. Taking a long view approach to &quot;slavery&quot; will help expand our conceptualization of the institution to a global scale. We will also engage material about the linkages and shifts between older forms of captivity and bonded labor and what scholars deem &quot;modern slavery&quot; as a result of new and radically evolving technologies. We will examine issues of human trafficking, sex trafficking, and child labor in tandem with the role that new technologies play in facilitating/foreclosing these forms of bonded and forced labor."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "All readings will be available on Canvas."}], "lmod": "2/13/17 6:45 PM (CT)", "subject": "INTL_ST"}]
