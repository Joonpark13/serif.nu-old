[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course introduces students to both critical and practical perspectives on international development through a combination of readings, lectures, speakers, case studies, written assignments, and oral presentations. Students will learn about the history of international development from its colonial foundations to its present dynamics. In addition to the history, students will explore the ethical dilemmas involved in doing development work, the challenges of measuring development, the relationship between sustainability and development, and the role of identity in development. To complement the historical and theoretical perspectives, students will analyze mechanisms of development -government, private sector, nonprofit sector, and research - through case studies. Every week, students will hear from one or more thought leaders and practitioners working in various sectors of international development.", "name": "Topics in International Studies", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G30", "topic": "Intro Int'l Dev: Issues and Practice", "course": "290-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/INTL_ST/290-0/36782", "instructor": ["Margarita   Rayzberg"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "36782", "subject": "INTL_ST"}]
