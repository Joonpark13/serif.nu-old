For the past 50 years, U.S. policymakers have struggled to define America's role in an ever more complex world where threats multiply and challenges morph and endure. The period beginning with the Vietnam War traces an arc that reaches from Soviet nuclear arsenals to Islamic suicide bombers, from a fear of falling dominoes in Southeast Asia to hopes for a wave of democracy in the Middle East. And now the rise of right-wing populists in Europe, a newly activist Russia and the presidency of Donald Trump. This course uses an engaging set of examples and materials to chart one of the most intriguing stretches of international engagement in U.S. history. We will work collaboratively to understand why decisions were made, how policies were implemented and sold, and what it all may mean in the end. Assessing sources from presidential speeches and critics' rejoinders to film documentaries and media accounts, we will study goals and motivations, ends and means, in an array of case studies. As the course progresses, we will pay particular attention to the foreign policy choices of President Trump and the domestic debate about those choices.", "name": "Special Topics in International Studies", "section": "21", "location": "Fisk Hall 311", "topic": "Dilemmas of Am.

Through this course you will better understand the legality of these responses, the obligations of signatory states to the Refugee Convention, the role of refugee hosting states, the ways in which the humanitarian system of refugee protection contributes to global cooperation and its shortcomings.

How can land explain different conflict dynamics? And what policy implications emerge from a close study of land rights around issues of economic development, food security, peacebuilding, or environmental conversation? We apply these questions to different regional contexts and country-specific case studies including Kenya, China, Indonesia, Colombia, and Afghanistan.

The term \"fractured\" is frequently used today to refer to the splintering of societies, nations, and the \"global community\". We will examine these phenomena and the challenges posed to systems of governance.<br/><br/>This era is foreshadowed in the work of particular scholars, such as Crawford Young, The Rise of Cultural Pluralism (1993), and Robert Cooper, The Breaking of Nations (2003). In the foreword to a 2001 book, The Self-Determination of Peoples, the following prescient words can be read: \"Unrest in one part of the world can bring bombs, terror, and refugees to another, where public sentiment may lead to intervention in the conflict one way or the other; thus local conflicts are globalized.\"<br/><br/>Intense conflicts take place across several axes: ethnic nationalism, religious sectarianism vs. secularism, \"ordinary people\" vs. elites, rural and small towns vs. cities, and migrants vs citizens. Ideologies that seemed triumphant after the Cold War, such as constitutional democracy and economic liberalism, are vigorously contested. New constructions are given to once familiar concepts such as sovereignty, privilege, and populism. Election contests in Britain, the United States, and several other western democracies deepen societal divisions and enhance uncertainty.<br/><br/>Some authors have grappled with the governance dimension of these challenges. They include Francis Fukuyama in several works, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in Why Nations Fail? (2012) and Jonathan Tepperman, in The Fix (2016). Contributing to the sense of global disarray are persistent wars and increasing reliance on shadow forms of warfare: drones, cyber-attacks, and Special Forces. The fracturing of nations is vividly conveyed by waves of refugees fleeing violence and distress in Africa and the Middle East. So also is the \"disintegrating of Europe\", as discussed in a January 2017 essay by Timothy Garton Ash, chronicler of the post-1989 democratic transitions in Eastern Europe.<br/><br/>This course will devote special attention to the African experience. Most African countries contend with multiple lines of division: ethnic, linguistic, religious, regional, and class. How, it will be asked, have highly diverse nations maintained nationhood? How are they coping with the current fraying of the global order and economic upheavals?

Urbanization, informality, gendered places, consumption, urban regeneration, local politics, crime and branding the city are some of the themes of our discussion. We study these themes in relation to two main questions: How do spatial changes engender new social practices and redefine cultural difference and vice versa?; How do power struggles at the intersection of local and global interests shape urban change?
