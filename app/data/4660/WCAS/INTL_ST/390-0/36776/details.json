Urbanization, informality, gendered places, consumption, urban regeneration, local politics, crime and branding the city are some of the themes of our discussion. We study these themes in relation to two main questions: How do spatial changes engender new social practices and redefine cultural difference and vice versa?; How do power struggles at the intersection of local and global interests shape urban change? We try to answer these questions by drawing on readings in history, anthropology and sociology disciplines.
