In the United States the new Trump Administration has issued Executive Orders suspending refugee admission for four months, banning entry of Syrian refugee entirely until further notice and reducing the country's total refugee admissions for the fiscal year 2017 by more than half. Across Europe the situation for refugees is just as bleak. Through this course you will better understand the legality of these responses, the obligations of signatory states to the Refugee Convention, the role of refugee hosting states, the ways in which the humanitarian system of refugee protection contributes to global cooperation and its shortcomings. More broadly, we will consider the differences in the kinds of refugee situations we have today and learn about what it means to be a refugee."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "1.
