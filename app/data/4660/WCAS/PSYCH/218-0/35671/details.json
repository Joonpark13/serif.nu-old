The course considers perspectives and methods in developmental research. As each new topic is introduced, students are encouraged to think critically about the assumptions and methods that underlie the research. A central goal is to help students develop an appreciation of different criteria for evaluating research and other forms of evidence. The discussion sections will allow students to consider how the theoretical and research findings are relevant to more applied issues."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: Psych 110"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "The grades will be based on weekly multiple choice quizzes, weekly written answers to discussion questions, and a final essay-question exam."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Siegler, R.S., DeLoache, S.J., Eisenberg, N., &amp; Saffran, J.
