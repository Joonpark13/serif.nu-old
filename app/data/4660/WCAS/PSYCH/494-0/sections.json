[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The course is an advanced overview of the psychological study of human personality, with an emphasis upon both current (and a few classic) theories and current research in the field. Personality psychologists use empirical methods of behavioral science to understand the whole person in biological, social, and cultural context. The course focuses on approaches to personality that emphasize individual differences in dispositional traits, characteristic adaptations (e.g., values, beliefs, goals, motives), and integrative life stories. Personality psychologists employ trait concepts to sketch an outline of psychological individuality; they refer to characteristic adaptations to fill in many of the details of that outline; and they look to life stories to understand the full meaning of the individual life set in time, place, and history.", "name": "Personality Theory & Research", "section": "20", "location": "Swift Hall 231", "topic": "", "course": "494-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 9:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/PSYCH/494-0/35740", "instructor": ["Dan P McAdams"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "35740", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
