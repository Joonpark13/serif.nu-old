Personality psychologists use empirical methods of behavioral science to understand the whole person in biological, social, and cultural context. The course focuses on approaches to personality that emphasize individual differences in dispositional traits, characteristic adaptations (e.g., values, beliefs, goals, motives), and integrative life stories. Personality psychologists employ trait concepts to sketch an outline of psychological individuality; they refer to characteristic adaptations to fill in many of the details of that outline; and they look to life stories to understand the full meaning of the individual life set in time, place, and history."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "none.
