[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Psychologists today must deal with a broad range of ethical issues, such as charging fees, maintaining confidentiality, and obtaining informed consent for research and practice. This course considers many of the ethical questions and dilemmas that clinical scientists and therapists encounter in their everyday practice, research, and teaching. In our increasingly diverse culture, psychologists must also work with clients and research participants from diverse cultures and backgrounds. This course therefore also considers issues involved in culturally sensitive and aware research and multiculturally competent psychological services. It is also important for psychologists to be aware of historical trends and developments in research, teaching, and practice. Accordingly, this course will consider both original texts in the history of clincial psychology, as well as current issues in a historical context. The final objective of this course is to explore issues around psychological consultation for groups and systems.", "name": "History, Ethics, Diversity, and Consultation in Clinical Psychology", "section": "20", "location": "Swift Hall 210", "topic": "", "course": "420-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 9:15AM - 12:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/PSYCH/420-0/35747", "instructor": [""], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "35747", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
