This capacity influences not only how we interpret what other people say and do, but also how we communicate our own thoughts and desires. In this research seminar, we will read and discuss a selection of original theoretical and empirical literature related to perspective-taking and communication. These readings will cover topics such as: when and how young children acquire an understanding of others' minds, evidence for failures of perspective-taking in adult communication, and the role that &quot;mirror neurons&quot; may play in human interaction. There will be 2-3 readings each week. Students will be expected to prepare brief responses to each set of readings and to participate in class discussions. The bulk of the course grade will be based on a final research paper."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: Psych 205, 228"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "This is a research seminar, so there is not a textbook (I'll provide PDFs of the readings on Canvas)."}], "lmod": "2/7/17 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
