[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course provides a broad overview of the practice of clinical psychology and its theoretical and research base. Although it is my expectation that anyone interested in psychology would enjoy this course, this is an especially ideal class for those that are thinking about pursuing an advanced degree in clinical psychology or a related field such as clinical social work, psychiatry, marriage and family therapy, or other graduate fields. Topics covered in this course will include the history of the field, conducting psychotherapy, major theoretical orientations, clinical assessment, and several challenges and controversies facing the field today. Students will also read a book about career and life planning in your twenties written by a clinical psychologist.", "name": "Introduction to Clinical Psychology", "section": "20", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "306-0", "meeting_time": ["We 6:00PM - 8:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/PSYCH/306-0/35677", "instructor": ["Jeffrey Harrison Sieracki"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "35677", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
