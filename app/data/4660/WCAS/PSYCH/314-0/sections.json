[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this seminar we will examine the nature of the mind from both Buddhist and traditional Western psychological perspectives. We will employ a Buddhist technique for investigating mental activity by incorporating a brief meditation period into class and homework activities. We will also examine written materials from both traditions, and these will form the primary basis for class discussion and examinations.", "name": "Special Topics in Psychology", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G15", "topic": "Buddhist Psychology", "course": "314-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/PSYCH/314-0/35678", "instructor": ["Marcia F Grabowecky"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "35678", "subject": "PSYCH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Lots of people have beliefs that other people think are just plain weird. Why do people have these beliefs? We'll look at \"weird\" beliefs within our culture as well as some cross-cultural examples, and try to understand what leads people to develop and maintain these beliefs. Another issue is that one person's \"weird\" belief may be another person's firmly held conviction. From this perspective, we'll also try to understand which beliefs are rational. Among the topics we may cover are: superstition, parapsychology, ghosts, witchcraft, alien abduction, evolution vs. creationism, repressed memories of abuse, and dissociative identity disorder. Students will use a wide variety of academic and popular media resources (including empirical research articles, ethnographic descriptions, philosophical arguments, popular press books, and documentary films) to explore the bases for these beliefs and practices.", "name": "Special Topics in Psychology", "section": "21", "location": "Swift Hall 210", "topic": "Psychology and Weird Beliefs", "course": "314-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/PSYCH/314-0/35679", "instructor": ["Sara Cantonia Broaders"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "35679", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
