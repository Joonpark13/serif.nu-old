After reviewing various moments of the invention of photography in Europe and elsewhere, we will be especially interested in thinking about photography in Latin America broadly, especially as it appears in a variety of practices and genres such as landscape, survey, portraiture, snapshot, photojournalism, and art. As such, topics of interest include the representation of class, race and ethnicity; the visual consolidation of national and regional spaces; photography as a consumer culture; the state's creation of visual disciplinary regimes; the use of pictures as tools of contestation and memorialization; and others. Readings from the fields of history, art history, anthropology, sociology, and cultural criticism."}], "lmod": "2/9/17 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
