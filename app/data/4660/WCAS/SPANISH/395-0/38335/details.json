Others, like Lauren Berlant, counter-assert that capitalism's promises are little more than &quot;cruel optimism,&quot; and that its reality is that of miring the many in asymmetrical &quot;precarity.&quot;<br/><br/>This course will study a panoramic representation of work?urban, rural, white- and blue-collar, domestic, professional, agrarian, long-term, temporary?in Latin America, including Brazil and the U.S. border. We will strive for a diversity of region in studying a composite portrait of the representation of contemporary labor. Our principal medium will be film (such as Lisandro Alonso's La libertad and Gabriel Mascar\u00f3's Boi Neon), though we will include literary texts whenever possible (such as Diamela Eltit's Mano de obra).<br/><br/>The syllabus for the first two-thirds of the quarter will be set by the instructor; students will have the opportunity to contribute content during the last third of the course, depending upon enrollment. Students will be expected to participate actively in class discussion throughout, and to write short critical reactions ahead of each class session, in addition to a final paper. Class and viewings/readings will be in Spanish.<br/><br/>Prerequisite: 1 course from 250, 251, 260, or 261."}], "lmod": "2/21/17 6:51 PM (CT)", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
