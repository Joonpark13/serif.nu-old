The Cuban Revolution was a divisive event; even as left-leaning political groups around the world heralded it as the dawn of a new world order, thousands of Cubans fled the island, many for the United States. In the nearly six decades since 1959, the Revolution and its enigmatic leader(s) have been the subject of inspiration, imitation, and intense debate. In this course, we will look at how the Cuban Revolution has been portrayed and understood in literary and cultural production. We will read a diverse array of texts - political speeches, films, short stories, scholarly essays, novels, and selections from Cuban blogs - in an attempt to understand how Cuban writers have addressed questions of political engagement, national identity, and the place of art in the Revolution. We will then look at the effect of the Cuban Revolution on other Latin American writers, such as Julio Cort\u00e1zar and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. We will end by examining the influence of the Cuban Revolution on other revolutionary movements in Latin America, such as the Mexican Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: 1 course from 250, 251, 260, or 261."}], "lmod": "2/8/17 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
