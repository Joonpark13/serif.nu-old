[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In 1959, the island nation of Cuba shocked the world when a popular uprising overthrew dictator Fulgencia Batista and established a socialist state lead by Fidel Castro. The Cuban Revolution was a divisive event; even as left-leaning political groups around the world heralded it as a the dawn of a new world order, thousands of Cubans fled the island,many for the United States. Fifty years later, Cuba, the Revolution, and its enigmatic leader continue to be the subject of intense debate. In this course, we will look at how the Revolution has been portrayed by Cubans themselves. We will read a diverse array of texts - political speeches, short stories, scholarly essays, novels, and selectionsfrom contemporary blogs - in an attempt to understand how Cuban writers and directors have addressed questions of political engagement, national identity, and the place of art in the Revolution. We will also watch a number of films to see how Cuban cinema has explored these issues in visual and well as narrative terms. As we read and watch, we will pay particular attention to key moments in recent Cuban history such as the 1980 Mariel Boatlift and the post-Soviet economic crisis known as the \"Special Period\" (1990-).<br/><br/> Prerequisite: 1 course from 250, 251, 260, or 261.", "name": "Literature and Revolution in Latin America", "section": "1", "location": "University Hall 218", "topic": "", "course": "347-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/SPANISH/347-0/34875", "instructor": ["Emily A Maguire"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34875", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
