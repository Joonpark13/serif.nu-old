The emphasis is on what are conventionally regarded in political science as \"qualitative\" methods for the analysis of a relatively small number of cases. In sociology, this field is generally known as comparative-historical methodology. The course focuses on recent methodological writings, though a few classical pieces are also included. The readings are not specific to any substantive sub-field in political science or sociology. The course assumes no prior background in qualitative methodology.", "name": "Topics in Sociological Analysis", "section": "21", "location": "Scott Hall 212", "topic": "Methods of Comparative Development", "course": "476-0", "meeting_time": ["Fr 9:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/SOCIOL/476-0/35599", "instructor": ["James L Mahoney"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35599", "subject": "SOCIOL"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course addresses the role that social factors play in in the development of sociological perspectives and schools of thought.
