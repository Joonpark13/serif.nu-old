The emphasis is on what are conventionally regarded in political science as \"qualitative\" methods for the analysis of a relatively small number of cases. In sociology, this field is generally known as comparative-historical methodology. The course focuses on recent methodological writings, though a few classical pieces are also included. The readings are not specific to any substantive sub-field in political science or sociology. The course assumes no prior background in qualitative methodology.", "name": "Topics in Sociological Analysis", "section": "21", "location": "Scott Hall 212", "topic": "Methods of Comparative Development", "course": "476-0", "meeting_time": ["Fr 9:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/SOCIOL/476-0/35599", "instructor": ["James L Mahoney"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35599", "subject": "SOCIOL"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course addresses the role that social factors play in in the development of sociological perspectives and schools of thought.

Work in this area took off in tandem with the feminist and lesbian and gay social movements of the era, inspired by genitive theoretical works by Simone deBeauvoir, Gayle Rubin, Michel Foucault, Sherry Ortner, and many others. The political and intellectual ferment enabled and inspired exciting theoretical and empirical work on gender relations and sexualities across the disciplines. In this seminar, we focus on the work of social scientists, but will also seek, where possible, to situate their scholarship in relation to selected, pivotal texts from the humanities. We will consider present and future directions for theoretical and empirical work on gender relations and sexualities, and will also try to place the unique conundrums and disciplinary orientations behind our own research agendas in fruitful relationship to the claims, trajectories, and debates of feminist theory, theories of sexualities, and various other contemporaneous schools of critical theory. Seminar discussions will constitute the heart of the course, and two critical essays, or a longer paper, will offer each student the opportunity to explore the themes of the seminar with respect to their own disciplinary and research concerns.", "name": "Topics in Sociological Analysis", "section": "24", "location": "Parkes Hall 222", "topic": "Social Scientific Approaches to Gender and Sexuali", "course": "476-0", "meeting_time": ["We 1:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/SOCIOL/476-0/36384", "instructor": ["Ann Shola   Orloff"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "36384", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
