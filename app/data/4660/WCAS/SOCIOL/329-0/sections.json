[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course introduces students to the practice and potential of ethnography. From the pioneering community studies of W.E.B. Du Bois to recent work on the global circulation of capital, ethnography has been a major research method for sociologists. It is a method that seeks to capture?through close observation and participation?the rhythms and rhetorics of social existence. Students will both read exemplar works and engage in the craft of ethnography and related qualitative methods, such as in-depth interviewing and discourse analysis. The course will be particularly attentive to questions of ethics, theory-formation, and the power and politics of representation.", "name": "Field Research and Methods of Data Collection", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 111", "topic": "", "course": "329-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/SOCIOL/329-0/35565", "instructor": ["Michael D Rodriguez"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35565", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
