We focus these global metropolitans to examine how urban space has reconfigured through histories of natural and man-made disasters, politics and economy. Urbanization, informality, gendered places, consumption, urban regeneration, local politics, crime and branding the city are some of the themes of our discussion. We study these themes in relation to two main questions: How do spatial changes engender new social practices and redefine cultural difference and vice versa?; How do power struggles at the intersection of local and global interests shape urban change? We try to answer these questions by drawing on readings in history, anthropology and sociology disciplines. The course will be of interest for history, sociology, anthropology, political science and urban studies majors, who are interested in learning about the politics, society and economy in Turkey and Egypt in comparison to urban trends in the US."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Attendance at first class and throughout quarter is mandatory<br/>During preregistration this course is only open to Sociology Majors &amp; Minors.<br/><br/>This course is open to all undergraduates during regular registration."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "-Develop an interdisciplinary understanding of urban change by comparison of three cities <br/>-Know the main historical periods and social factors in the shaping of urban space, society and culture in the US and the Middle East<br/>-Acquire a critical understanding of broad generalizations about cities and cultures <br/>-Obtain the knowledge of common sociological concepts that could be applied to understanding other societies"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "All materials for this course will be made available through Canvas - no purchase necessary."}], "lmod": "2/14/17 6:49 PM (CT)", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
