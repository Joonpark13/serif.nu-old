Drawing on the historical, sociological and anthropological research in the region, the course aims to question stereotypes about the subordination of Muslim women and to offer a systematic reading and an analytical discussion of the political, economic and cultural structures that inform gender relations and sexuality. The course starts with an examination of early Islam and religious sources with regard to women's status, then moves on to nationalist and modernization movements in the 19th and 20th centuries, and finally focuses on women and men's lives in contemporary Egypt, Turkey and Iran. In this framework, special attention is given to Islamist mobilizations, the family, sexuality, neoliberalism, women's labor and LGBT."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Attendance at first class is mandatory.<br/>During preregistration this course is only open to Sociology Majors &amp; Minors.<br/><br/>This course is open to all undergraduates during regular registration."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "-Develop an interdisciplinary and comparative understanding of gender and sexuality in the Middle East <br/>-Know the main historical periods and social factors that play an important role in the construction of gender and sexuality in Egypt, Iran and Turkey<br/>-Evaluate the merits of common representations of the Middle East and its people in North America and Europe."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Discussion, presentations, short papers."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "All course materials will be made available on Canvas - no purchase necessary."}], "lmod": "2/6/17 6:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
