[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "E. pluribus unum. \"Out of many, one.\" This course will study the way in which American society is divided into various subgroups and subcultures. The bases of differentiation range from racial and ethnic groups , to religion, sexuality, to lifestyle and interest groups of all kinds, and regional and urban/rural subcultures. . The focus will be on how groups develop subcultures with distinct norms and symbols, create internal organizations and group solidarity, how they define boundaries between in group and out group, how they relate in conflict /competition or cooperation/tolerance with other groups. Consequences of these subcultures for individual identity, and for social inequality in terms of economic outcomes and politics and power. Students will engage in readings and discussions of these issues and through a focused case study of a specific subculture of choice. Grades based on reading response, participation, presentation, and final paper.", "name": "American Subcultures and Ethnic Groups", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 101", "topic": "", "course": "323-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/SOCIOL/323-0/35564", "instructor": ["Albert Dale   Hunter"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "35564", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
