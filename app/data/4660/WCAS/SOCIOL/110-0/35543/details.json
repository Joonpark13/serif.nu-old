Sociologists have turned this philosophical speculation into a systematic approach to building and testing theories. Sociological explanations center on the structure and dynamics of social groups (families, friendship networks, organizations, etc.) as enabling and constraining human behavior. In this course, you will learn to think like a sociologist - to use your &quot;sociological imagination&quot; to examine the social nature of a number of issues and behaviors, many of which may at first appear to be the results of strictly individual motives and personal choices. You will get a broad overview of the theories and methods used in sociology and how these are applied across a wide range of important phenomena, including gender, race, inequality, and education."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "During preregistration this course is only open to Sociology Majors &amp; Minors. <br/>This course is open to all students during regular registration."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Tentative book list.
