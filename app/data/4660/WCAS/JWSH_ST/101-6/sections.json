This question has been at the center of Jewish thought and practice from its very earliest times to the most recent. Beginning with passages from the Book of Genesis, the seminar discusses the question of unjustifiable suffering by examining a range of biblical texts and figures, culminating in the exemplary figure of Job, whose story we will read in conjunction with classical rabbinic commentary and impressive illustrations of the romantic poet William Blake. The seminar then turns to texts written in response to the Khmielnitsky massacres in the seventeenth century and the surge of pogroms in early twentieth-century Russia, with special emphasis on H. N. Bialik's poetic response to the Kishinev Pogrom of 1903 and Marc Chagall's Jewish crucifixion series composed in the wake of the destruction of Jewish shtetls in the First World War.
