Their study is a subject that combines the best of algebra and analysis. Its most important applications have been to quantum theory, but it crops up all over modern mathematics.<br/><br/>This seminar will cover a selection of the following topics: bounded and compact operators on Hilbert space; C*-algebras; the classification of commutative C*-algebras; Fredholm operators; Toeplitz operators and an introduction to K-theory."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Suggested Prerequisites: 321-1,2,3; but if you have only completed part of this sequence, you can take the seminar with the permission of the instructor.
