[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Operator algebras and non-commutative geometry<br/><br/>Historically, operator algebras arose as an abstraction of the idea of the space of continuous functions on a topological space: except that now, we allow these functions to violate the commutativity rule xy=yx. Their study is a subject that combines the best of algebra and analysis. Its most important applications have been to quantum theory, but it crops up all over modern mathematics.<br/><br/>This seminar will cover a selection of the following topics: bounded and compact operators on Hilbert space; C*-algebras; the classification of commutative C*-algebras; Fredholm operators; Toeplitz operators and an introduction to K-theory.", "name": "Undergraduate Seminar", "section": "71", "location": "Technological Institute L251", "topic": "", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/MATH/395-0/34197", "instructor": ["Steven Morris Zelditch"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34197", "subject": "MATH"}]
