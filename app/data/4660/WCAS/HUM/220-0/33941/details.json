Drawing largely on sociological and anthropological frameworks, we will first consider major theoretical approaches to the study of health and illness including how biomedical developments have reshaped what it means to be &quot;healthy&quot; or &quot;sick&quot; over time. We will then consider a series of themes that highlight the intersections of biomedicine, health, and society as they are understood and experienced by patients, doctors, scientists, caregivers, and others. With each topic, we will explore how the individual understandings and felt experience of health and illness are contingent upon cultural and institutional dynamics larger than that of the individual. Broad themes may include topics such as birth, death, sex and gender, risk, race, drugs, disability, mental illness, environmental toxicity, etc. Readings will highlight some of the complex dynamics between biomedicine and society through a particular topic reflecting the theme - for example, breast cancer risk and its treatment; schizophrenia and race; &quot;death&quot; in the U.S. versus Japan; better sex through drugs, and so on. Students will leave the course with a broad understanding of key theoretical perspectives and themes in the social studies of health, illness, and biomedicine."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "All materials for this course will be made available on Canvas; no purchase necessary."}], "lmod": "2/7/17 6:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "HUM"}]
