They stand at the intersection of the normal and abnormal, the natural and unnatural. Why did these images become such favorite subjects for artistic representations, and what do they tell us about the cultures that produced them? Can we connect the invention of supernatural creatures composed from multiple species with key moments in human social and cognitive development, such as the emergence of urban society?
