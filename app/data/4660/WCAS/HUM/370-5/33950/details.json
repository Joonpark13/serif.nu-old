Recent debates over the social and environmental consequences of Genetically Modified Organisms (sometimes called ?Frankenfoods'), media buzz over alternative proteins like crickets, and the mainstream popularity of veganism have provoked a critical return to questions of edibility, the agency of our food, and ecological responsibility - all of which challenge normative, Western orientations towards consumption practices. This course examines cultural constructions of appetite and nourishment by asking: What are the processes through which humans have come to view plants and animals as food? How is edibility either celebrated or refused across time, space, and bodies? And most importantly, how are specific worldviews mobilized in understanding human encounters with the things that we eat? Taking Donna Haraway's landmark work &quot;A Cyborg Manifesto&quot; as a point of departure, cultural constructions of edibility will be explored by theorizing the food system as a vital, material force."}], "lmod": "2/8/17 6:43 PM (CT)", "subject": "HUM"}]
