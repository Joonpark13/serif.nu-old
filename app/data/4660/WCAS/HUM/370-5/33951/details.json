This advanced seminar focuses on the philosophical idea of cosmopolitanism, or world citizenship, as it has appeared in literature from the eighteenth century to today, and proposes that we see the &quot;world&quot; itself as an imaginative category. Reading from the tradition of literary texts that have asked readers to picture not just a locality or a nation but a world, we will ask: who exists within the circle of sympathy that these works create, and what are the terms of inclusion/exclusion? Is being a citizen of the world the privilege of the few, or the burden of many? What is the relationship between understanding &quot;the whole world&quot; as one's home, and other historical forms of global imagining that are less utopian, like empire, neoliberalism, and &quot;the global war on terrorism?&quot; Our study will begin with the formation of the European concept of cosmopolitanism in the eighteenth century and proceed through various counter-perspectives from non-Western literatures. When we are asked to imagine &quot;the world,&quot; what?or whose?world is it?"}], "lmod": "2/9/17 6:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "HUM"}]
