This course provides undergraduates with a serious intellectual framework for analyzing what they see or hear when they attend a play or go to a museum and to discuss such endeavors in a structured environment. During a scheduled week of performances, walking tours, museum visits, and other events in Chicago, experts will introduce students to new forms of cultural production and encourage them to think in meaningful ways about the arts and humanities. Students will reflect on events during the week of spring break in a series of three blog posts, and submit a final review essay two weeks into the spring quarter. <strong>Enrollment in this course is by application only.</strong>"}], "lmod": "2/19/17 6:49 PM (CT)", "subject": "HUM"}]
