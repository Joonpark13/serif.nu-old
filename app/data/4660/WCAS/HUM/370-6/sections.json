[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Art, Writing, Technology: New Approaches to the Digital Humanities<br/><br/>In 1882, Friedrich Nietzsche used his typewriter to declare: \"Our writing tools are also working on our thoughts.\" How might we reconsider the history of art and literature in a time when our thoughts are being worked over by iPhones, YouTube, and Google? Can we rewrite this archive using tactics found in contemporary art and poetry? This class follows emerging trends in art and writing to construct new approaches to historical objects that are equally likely to appear on Soundcloud, in a PDF, through online videos, or even on Facebook. Studying the digital humanities alongside modes of contemporary art and letters, we'll reimagine historical works through today's emerging forms and formats. Through readings and class visits from artists and poets, we will explore works that translate established forms into a variety of new media formats. How might Twitter facilitate works of art? What does YouTube demand of poetry? Using a combination of seminar conversations and collaborative workshops, we'll engage in a series of weekly experiments that attempt to reconfigure the history of art and literature through the filter of contemporary writing tools. No previous training in art, poetry, or new media is required.", "name": "Special Topics in the Humanities", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L07", "topic": "Art, Writing, Technology", "course": "370-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HUM/370-6/33952", "instructor": ["Daniel Scott Snelson"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33952", "subject": "HUM"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The 20th century British poet and literary critic T. S. Eliot wrote that one \"must know all of Shakespeare's work in order to know any of it.\" This course takes a journey along the whole of Shakespeare's plays that will enable us to ask: what do we learn when we pursue this comprehensive perspective? As Eliot puts it, \"The standard set by Shakespeare is that of a continuous development from first to last\" that ultimately becomes a display of Shakespeare's \"power of development.\" In various ways we will consider what generates this power and what role different genres at different moments may play in activating this ongoing process. What stories do we see when we imagine the Shakespeare corpus as incremental narratives? How does Shakespeare's use of generic form change over time? How does the overall sequence of these changes create strikingly different endings and outcomes?", "name": "Special Topics in the Humanities", "section": "21", "location": "University Hall 122", "topic": "Shakespeare-The Whole Journey", "course": "370-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/HUM/370-6/33953", "instructor": ["Peter B Erickson"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33953", "subject": "HUM"}]
