It features two weeks of classroom-based instruction on experimental design, data handling, and analysis; supplemented by NIH Rigor And Reproducibility Training Modules. This overview will be followed by a combination of lectures and labs addressing a broad range of analytical techniques and imaging methods. These lessons will then be applied to inquiry-based learning in Northwestern's advanced centers and instrumentation cores. <br/><br/>In addition to lecture, students are expected to devise two Mini-Research Projects and will work on one with senior research staff to apply specific protocols utilizing instrumentation available within Research Cores and University Centers. Students will design specific experiments in selected areas of their research interest, and learn new sample preparation methods and instrumentation within one of the following areas: genomics, proteomics, in vivo and molecular imaging, small molecule synthesis and purification; high-throughput screening, structural biology (x-ray crystallography or Cryo-EM), analysis of bioelements. <br/><br/>Material generated in the class counts for course credit will be usable in the students' research group settings."}], "lmod": "2/8/17 6:41 PM (CT)", "subject": "CHEM"}]
