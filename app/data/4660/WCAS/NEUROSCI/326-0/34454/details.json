This course examines what neurobiologists know about how brain cells, synapses, and circuits process experience to produce lasting changes in behavior. Lectures will involve in depth discussion of original research findings, from classic studies in invertebrates to the latest molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral studies in mammalian systems. Along the way, students will learn to think logically about the design and interpretation of neurobiological experiments."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites: NEUROSCI 202 and 206, or BIOL SCI 302 or 311 or consent of instructor."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Mid-term exam: 25%<br/>Research paper: 30%<br/>Quizzes: 10%<br/>Final exam: 35%"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Selected reviews from the literature will be provided."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Pre-requisite: Students must have completed NEUROSCI 202 and 206, or BIOL SCI 302 or 311, or gain permission of the instructor to register for this course."}], "lmod": "2/8/17 6:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "NEUROSCI"}]
