Topics for discussion will include sensory and motor systems, sensorimotor integration, cognition, and diseases of the brain. Time will be devoted to presentation of essential material for each system as well as to a discussion of key experiments that have contributed to our understanding of these systems. As an aid to the comprehension of relationships between structure and function in the central nervous system, one class period will be devoted to the dissection of a sheep's brain."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: Neurosci 202 or Biol Sci 302 or 311."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lectures; discussion of research articles."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Two exams, term paper, class participation, and group presentation"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Neuroscience, 5th Edition edited by Purves, Augustine, Fitzpatrick, Hall, LaMantia, and White.
