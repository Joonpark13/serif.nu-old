[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is a project-based laboratory to investigate the genetic roots of neurobiology and behavior in a simple model system. We focus on non-electrode methods to study neural circuits and behavior including mutant analysis, opto- and thermogenetics, neuroanatomical techniques, and behavioral paradigms such as courtship, aggression, circadian and sleep behavior. We will use the fruit fly as a model system because of the amazing genetic tools available to study the fly nervous system and the conservation of basic neurobiological processes between flies and humans. The course will consist of two sections with overlap. During the first section of the course you will learn a variety of techniques and assays to study the nervous system, practicing on genotypes with known phenotypes. As you learn and read, you will design a project using the techniques learned in class, to be completed in the final weeks of the course.<br/>This will be presented to the group in the final week of class. NOTE: You will need to come into the labs outside class time at least a few times a week to collect virgin flies. This is done at the beginning and the end of the day. It need not take more than 15-20 minutes once you become proficient but it is an ongoing task. You will likely also need to come to continue or finish experiments at flexibly scheduled times. Time outside lab is not expected to exceed 2 hours per week typically but motivated students are welcome to spend more time.
