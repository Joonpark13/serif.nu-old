Wherever possible, critical readings will be related to specific Kafka texts, even where they are more general in character. The fascination of the authorial name - Kafka - will be juxtaposed to the complexity of the texts themselves, especially the narrative texts, on which the emphasis will be placed. Texts to be read include (the list is not exhaustive): 1. Kafka: Cares of a House Father; 2. The Hunter Gracchus; 3. Josefine, Songstress of the People of Mice; 4. &quot;The Great Theater of Oklahama (sic!),&quot; from The Man Who Disappeared (aka America); 5. Before the Law (and its insertion in The Trial). Critics to be read include: W. Benjamin (in connection with The Theater of Oklahama), Th. Adorno (The Castle), J. Derrida (Before the Law), M. Blanchot, Deleuze-Guattari.
