[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The term \"Hebrew Literature\" has both archaic and modern connotations: Hebrew it is the language of the Hebrew Bible, as well as the language of today's literature and culture in Israel. In this survey course, we will sample Hebrew literary texts (in English translation) ranging from Biblical to modern times. We will ask: What is the role of Hebrew literature in the formation of the Jewish collectivity? How does Hebrew literature interact with Jewish scriptures? How does it contribute to Jewish nationalism? In addition to the Hebrew Bible, we will read texts from medieval Muslim Spain, from the period of the Jewish enlightenment; we will ponder on texts written as a response to the Jewish Holocaust as well as on texts dealing with the nation-state, written circa 1948. Moreover, the course will introduce the case of Palestinian authors writing in Hebrew, thereby challenging the equation between the language (Hebrew) and the People (Jews).", "name": "Modern Hebrew Literature in Translation", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-415", "topic": "Exploring Hebrew Literature", "course": "278-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/COMP_LIT/278-0/33082", "instructor": ["Yael   Dekel"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33082", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
