In each case, we will study the literary or theatrical inspiration in its own right (those who can are encouraged to read these classic works in their original languages), become familiar with the opera, and proceed to some famous films and other video adaptations of each opera. We will end the course with a popular film that is directly based on neither a literary original nor an opera, but relies strongly on conventions from both and features a performance of one of our featured operas.<br/>The course is open to all interested students who read musical notation or read fluently in at least one of French, German, or Italian."}], "lmod": "2/7/17 6:42 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
