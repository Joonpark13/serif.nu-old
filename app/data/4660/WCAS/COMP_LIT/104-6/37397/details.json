Behind this encounter lies the larger question What is an animal? which, as we'll discover together, establishes the borders around humanity, but also around modernity itself. Do animals have language? Are animals like machines? Do they have a soul? What happens when human-animal hybrids or encounters appear in literature, film, art, and everyday life. <br/> <br/>Through field trips to parks, zoos, and museums, and an analysis of sources as diverse as Alexander McQueen's fashion shows, Kafka's short stories, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Georges Franju's short film The Blood of the Beasts, and Leonardo DiCaprio in a bear hide in The Revenant, this class will explore the role of sense perception, language, and emotion, and more surprisingly the role of race, gender, and power in the relationship between humans and animals, asking how encounters with animals affect relations among humans themselves. During excursions to the Lincoln Park Zoo and the Field Museum, we will go on a scavenger hunt, experience animals and their representations at first hand, and discuss why the presence of animals in our culture is an essential part of how we understand ourselves. <br/> <br/>Texts and other materials may include: a selection of short stories by Kafka; Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream; Georges Franju's short film The Blood of the Beasts; art installations by Marc Dion; fashions by Alexander McQueen; and some brief theoretical passages from the works of Descartes and Foucault"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "seminar, small group discussions, peer group work"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "participation in class discussion, short writing assignments, midterm paper (rewrite option), final paper"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "course reader"}], "lmod": "2/19/17 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
