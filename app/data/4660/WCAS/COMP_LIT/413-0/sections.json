More than half a century later, a vast body of fiction and non-fiction writing has been dedicated to recording, imagining, extrapolating from, and attempting to comprehend these catastrophic events. It has been argued that the Holocaust cannot be represented (aesthetic limitations), that it should not be represented (Bilderverbot/ban on graven images), and that it must be born witness to and never forgotten (ethical imperatives). So, what exactly is Holocaust writing? This course seeks to answer this question through the analysis of both canonical and lesser-known variants of autobiographical as well as fiction writing about and by Holocaust survivors, such as Primo Levi, Tadeusz Borowski, Jorge Semprun, Grete Weil, and Elie Wiesel. We will explore genres, styles, and tropes associated with Holocaust writing by examining the use of irony, satire, and hyperbole (Hans Keilson, Georges Perec), as well as the grotesque or even pornographic in fiction (Edgar Hilsenrath, Ka-Tzetnik 135633), through to the critical circumscription of the essay form (Jean Am\u00e9ry, Primo Levi, T.W. Adorno); up to its ongoing impact in the field of continental philosophy (Robert Antelme, Marguerite Duras, Sarah Kofman, Maurice Blancet, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, Giorgio Agamben). Other topics that will be addressed include the question of authenticity (the Wilkomirski affair); the \"era of the witness\" and the status of testimony (Shoshana Felman, Dori Laub, Annette Wieviorka); copyright and the reproduction of memory (Anne Frank, Marianne Hirsch); revenge and fantasy (Aharon Appelfeld, Wolfgang Hildesheimer), the connection between writing and affect in postwar therapeutic and psychoanalytic writing (Hans Keilson, Bruno Bettelheim, Viktor Frankl); and, finally, what might be called Holocaust writing of the second degree (D.M. Thomas, David Grossman, W.G. Sebald).", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Comparative Studies in Theme", "title": "WCAS COMP_LIT 413-0-20 Comparative Studies in Theme", "lmod": "2/26/17 6:45 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/467-5173", "instructor_name": "Anna Maree Parkinson", "instructor_addr": "1800 Campus Drive, 3-321 Kresge Centennial Hall, Evanston"}], "topic": "", "course": "413-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "\"Holocaust Writing and Its Discontents\"<br/>Described as a fundamental \"break in civilization\" (Dan Diner) or a caesura in Enlightenment humanism, the term \"Holocaust\" designates the systematic persecution and murder of over two-thirds of the European Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators.
