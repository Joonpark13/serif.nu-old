It aims to develop our skills in the close reading of literary works in relation to the literary and theoretical framework and the historical and social period in which they developed. To that end, we will read essays on feminine sexuality by Freud and Lacan, excerpts from Beauvoir's groundbreaking essay, The Second Sex, social and historical accounts of the period, analyses by feminist scholars, and novels by a range of writers including Leduc, Duras, and Guibert."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Short lectures and class discussions in English."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation is essential.
