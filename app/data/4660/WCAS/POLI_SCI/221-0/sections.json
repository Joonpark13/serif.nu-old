[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course provides an introductory look at the \"rules of the game\" in local politics, with an emphasis on Chicago and other large American cities. What key forces and institutions shape local politics? Why do some cities respond to powerful social forces differently than others? What are the implications for democratic responsiveness and civic outcomes?
