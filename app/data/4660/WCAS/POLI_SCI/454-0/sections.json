We will examine major theories from the fields of sociology and political science about social movements: collective challenges to authority that aim to change society or institute structural changes in an existing state or states. We will consider competing explanations of the emergence of collective action, the conditions under which people do or do not rebel, various aspects of the strategic interaction between social movements and states, the sources of movement strategy, and the determinants of movement outcomes. We will read theoretical works and case studies on a range of social movements in both democratic and nondemocratic state settings.
