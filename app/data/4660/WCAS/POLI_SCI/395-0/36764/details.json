The main goal of the course is to think critically about key questions on political violence such as the following: Why do people participate in civil wars? Why do insurgent organizations kill civilians? Why do citizens support violent political groups?Why do states kill their own citizens?Why do riots often happen before elections? By thinking about political violence students will learn how to ask questions about political phenomena, what is the role of theory, and how we rely on empirical evidence to make inferences. The seminar will emphasize the importance of critically examining the internal consistency of arguments as well as what can (and cannot) be inferred based on available evidence."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Must be a junior or senior"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Memos and final paper"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "None"}], "lmod": "2/6/17 6:53 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
