[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The European Union (EU) is unique in world history. Never before have twenty-eight sovereign states cooperated more intensely on political, economic, social, judicial and security affairs than is currently the case under the European Union umbrella. This course examines how this \"multi-state\" entity operates in international affairs. What are the power assets of the European Union? How do EU member states cooperate in economic affairs? How do they project power in security affairs? What does the EU do to fight ISIS, to resolve the conflict in Ukraine or to deal with the current refugee crisis? How does it cooperate with the United States? Is this cooperation successful? What does the future hold for the EU?", "name": "European Union in International Affairs", "section": "20", "location": "Scott Hall 212", "topic": "", "course": "346-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 9:30AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/POLI_SCI/346-0/35410", "instructor": ["Marina Elisabeth Philippina Henke"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "35410", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
