Most, but not all, APD work falls within the broad category of historical institutionalism. Its substantive inquiries range widely, but all leading work seeks to conceptualize processes and dynamics of change as they unfold over time, to identify political patterns over the long dur\u00e9e, and to theorize about relations of continuity and change. This seminar surveys classic and contemporary APD scholarship across a range of topics."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "By the end of the course, students will have surveyed classic and contemporary works in the field and will understand key theoretical debates and major methodological approaches."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Open seminar-style discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Discussion (40%), online comments (20%), final exam or research paper (40%)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "&quot;Stephen Skowronek, Building a New American State (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1982).
