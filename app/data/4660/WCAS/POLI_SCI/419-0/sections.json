[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "American Political Development (APD) is a growing subfield of American Politics with important links to other fields of political science, such as political theory, comparative politics, and public law, as well as political sociology and history. Most, but not all, APD work falls within the broad category of historical institutionalism. Its substantive inquiries range widely, but all leading work seeks to conceptualize processes and dynamics of change as they unfold over time, to identify political patterns over the long dur\u00e9e, and to theorize about relations of continuity and change. This seminar surveys classic and contemporary APD scholarship across a range of topics.", "name": "American Political Development", "section": "20", "location": "Scott Hall 201 Ripton Room", "topic": "", "course": "419-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 9:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/POLI_SCI/419-0/35531", "instructor": ["Daniel J Galvin"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35531", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
