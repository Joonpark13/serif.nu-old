[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Following Hannah Arendt's articulation of her own perspective as starting with \"eyes unclouded by philosophy,\" this seminar will attend to the distinctive and unique orientation she terms \"political theory.\" To that end, we'll pursue the significance that \"the gulf between philosophy and politics,\" as she calls it, carries for her diagnostics of late modernity, the unprecedentedness of totalitarianism, \"world alienation,\" and their relation to the tradition of the history of western political thought. The structure of the seminar finds its organizational logic in three of Arendt's primary works: The Origins of Totalitarianism; The Human Condition; and The Life of the Mind, around which we'll read essays on freedom, authority, culture, and history from Between Past and Future. A fourth major work, Eichmann in Jerusalem, arrives at the mid-quarter along with a week devoted to unpublished essays on thinking and moral considerations in Responsibility and Judgment. All along we'll be concerned to engage the words, concepts, and categories (e.g. labor, work, action; natality, mortality, plurality; power, freedom; thinking, willing, judging; space of appearances; politics) that mark Arendt's unique mode of historical, interpretive, and phenomenological political theorizing. Secondary sources will occasionally appear; but our main concern will be on the primary texts with an aim toward critical, creative, and comprehensive understanding of them.", "name": "Contemporary Political Thought", "section": "20", "location": "Scott Hall 201 Ripton Room", "topic": "", "course": "464-0", "meeting_time": ["We 3:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/POLI_SCI/464-0/35523", "instructor": ["Mary Golden Dietz"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35523", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
