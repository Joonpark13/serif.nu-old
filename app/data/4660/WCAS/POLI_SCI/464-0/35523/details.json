The structure of the seminar finds its organizational logic in three of Arendt's primary works: The Origins of Totalitarianism; The Human Condition; and The Life of the Mind, around which we'll read essays on freedom, authority, culture, and history from Between Past and Future. A fourth major work, Eichmann in Jerusalem, arrives at the mid-quarter along with a week devoted to unpublished essays on thinking and moral considerations in Responsibility and Judgment. All along we'll be concerned to engage the words, concepts, and categories (e.g. labor, work, action; natality, mortality, plurality; power, freedom; thinking, willing, judging; space of appearances; politics) that mark Arendt's unique mode of historical, interpretive, and phenomenological political theorizing. Secondary sources will occasionally appear; but our main concern will be on the primary texts with an aim toward critical, creative, and comprehensive understanding of them."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "grad students only"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Critical, creative, and comprehensive understanding of some of Arendt's major works."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Eight short &quot;wordbook&quot; entries due weekly; final seminar paper due exam week"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Author of all is HANNAH ARENDT; <br/>All ISBN/s are ISBN-10:<br/>Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil (Penguin, 1963) #0143039881<br/>The Human Condition [2nd Edition] (U Chicago, 1958) #0226025985<br/>Origins of Totalitarianism (Benediction Bks, 2009/1951) #0156701537<br/>Between Past and Future (Penguin, 1961) #0143104810<br/>The Life of the Mind (One Volume Edition) (Harcourt Brace, 1978) #0156519925<br/>Responsibility and Judgment (Schocken, 2003) #0805211624"}], "lmod": "2/13/17 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
