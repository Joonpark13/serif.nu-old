[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The decades following WW II are sometimes described by students of International Relations as \"The Long Peace.\" Despite obvious tensions and a Cold War between the superpowers and despite major differences in ideology and economic policies, major power war did not erupt. Indeed, some scholars wonder whether such war has become obsolete. <br/> Be that as it may, by some counts, the past half century has seen more than 20 million deaths in many other conflicts. Among these conflicts, civil wars have been some of the bloodiest and costliest. This course will examine the causes behind such conflicts as well as study how such conflicts might be terminated or prevented altogether. Some of the causes of civil wars will be internal to the states in question, other causes might be due to international actors and external forces. Correspondingly some efforts to terminate or prevent such conflicts will reside at the domestic level while others will operate in the international arena.<br/> The class will be a mixture of lectures and seminar style participation, culminating in a short research project that is of particular interest to the student and which will be designed in cooperation with the professor. Throughout the course, students will be expected to keep up with the readings and to actively contribute to the discussions in class.<br/> Although our main attention will go to conflicts after 1945, the course is not focused on any specific geographic area or any specific war. Instead, the aim of the course is to increase your understanding of the phenomenon of civil wars in general. With this general theoretical knowledge of civil wars, the student will then design a research project of a case or cases that are of particular interest to the student. One-on-one meetings with the professor and graduate assistant will help you with the research design.", "name": "Civil Wars", "section": "20", "location": "Scott Hall 212", "topic": "", "course": "376-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/POLI_SCI/376-0/35525", "instructor": ["Hendrik   Spruyt"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35525", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
