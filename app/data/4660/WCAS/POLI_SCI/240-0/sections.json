[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines international politics from various perspectives ? theoretical, practical, historical, and more ? to address contemporary policy issues and controversies. Political life rests on a conventional distinction between international and domestic affairs, with national governments sovereign over domestic affairs and competing over international matters.
