[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Globalization is arguably the most powerful force shaping international and domestic politics today. When observers discuss the effects of globalization, they may refer to any of a number of its different facets: economic, political, social, and environmental. In this course we will focus primarily on economic globalization - the increase in the cross-border flows of goods and services, workers, firms, and money. This course is intended to take stock of globalization in light of the global economic meltdown. What is globalization? Are its effects on the economic fortunes of individuals in wealthy democracies different than in developing countries? Does the reduction of barriers to economic exchange harm national cultures? Is terrorism linked to globalization? Does globalization erode or enhance American military power? Has globalization gone too far - or has it not gone far enough? These are the kinds of questions that will be discussed in the course. The course is organized around six major topics: (1) conceptualizing globalization; (2) assessing the constituent parts of economic globalization (trade, finance, multinational production, and immigration); (3) how different national styles of capitalism in the advanced industrial countries have adjusted to pressure from rising economic globalism; (4) how developing countries joined the globalization bandwagon and whether global economic inequality has increased or decreased as a result; (5) the consequences of increasing economic integration for distinct national cultures; (6) the challenges to globalization posed by transnational terrorism, geopolitical rivalries, and the series of economic crises after 2008.", "name": "Globalization", "section": "20", "location": "Fisk Hall 217", "topic": "", "course": "348-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/POLI_SCI/348-0/35508", "instructor": ["Stephen C Nelson"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35508", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
