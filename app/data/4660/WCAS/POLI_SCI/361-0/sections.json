[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course explores the concepts of democracy, democratization, and democratic transitions in a historical comparative perspective. We begin with a survey of the pre-modern and recent waves of democratic transitions. By drawing on the experiences of societies in various regions around the world, we will examine what separates, if ever, democratic transitions in Western from those in non-Western societies. The second part of the course focuses on theories of democratization. By contrasting and comparing existing theories, we will discuss what we know of democratization today. In the third part of the course, we consider the cases of failed democratic transitions. Using the case of post-2000 Turkey, we will discuss whether democratization and democratic reversal unfold in similar ways. The final part of the course reevaluates democratization with respect to the concept of \"de-democratization.\"", "name": "Democratic Transitions", "section": "20", "location": "Parkes Hall 215", "topic": "", "course": "361-0", "meeting_time": ["We 9:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/POLI_SCI/361-0/35411", "instructor": ["Basak   Taraktas"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "35411", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
