It aims to show how these two authors were part of the cultural and political fabric from al-Kindi (Ninth century) to Averroes (Twelfth century). Although Aristotle curriculum was best known to the Muslim philosophers than the texts of Plato, these two authors were considered as an example of human wisdom, moral excellence and the basis of a solid scientific methodology. Plato was referred to as the \u00ab Divine \u00bb and the \u00ab Sublime \u00bb while Aristotle was the \u00ab Sage \u00bb or the \u00ab First Master \u00bb. After giving an account of the work translated and commented on in Arabic, the course deals with the major topics of moral and political philosophy in which the influence of Plato and Aristotle was quite visible in R\u00e2z\u00ee (d. 925), F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee (d. 950) or Averroes's works (d. 1198). A special attention will be paid to the central role played by Plato's Republic and Aristotles's Nicomachean Ethics in shaping political aspects of Islamic philosophy, and in creating new issues related to the place of the philosopher in society, the theological-political problem, and the model of the virtuous City."}], "lmod": "2/12/17 7:00 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
