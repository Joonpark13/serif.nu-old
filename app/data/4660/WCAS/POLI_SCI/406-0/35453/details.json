What is causation, how is it logically and mathematically related to correlation, and how can we as social scientists do better than simply measuring observed relationships among variables?<br/><br/>This course explores the available quantitative toolkit for causal inference in the social sciences. We will consider a series of methods that are generally expected or increasingly common in applied research: experimentation, regression with control variables, instrumental variables, matching, mechanism and regression-discontinuity designs, and panel inference. Finally, we will discuss some approaches to missing data."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Graduate student or instructor's permission"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar and Lecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Weekly assignments and a final exam."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "&quot;Stephen L.
