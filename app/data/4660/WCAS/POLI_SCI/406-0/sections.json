[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In the social sciences, we often repeat the mantra, \"Correlation is not causation.\" Explaining what this saying means is nontrivial. What is causation, how is it logically and mathematically related to correlation, and how can we as social scientists do better than simply measuring observed relationships among variables?<br/><br/>This course explores the available quantitative toolkit for causal inference in the social sciences. We will consider a series of methods that are generally expected or increasingly common in applied research: experimentation, regression with control variables, instrumental variables, matching, mechanism and regression-discontinuity designs, and panel inference. Finally, we will discuss some approaches to missing data.", "name": "Quantitative Causal Inference", "section": "20", "location": "Scott Hall 212", "topic": "", "course": "406-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/POLI_SCI/406-0/35453", "instructor": ["Jason W Seawright"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35453", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
