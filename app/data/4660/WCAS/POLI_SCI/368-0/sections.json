[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What makes some countries rich and others poor? Why are some states successful in forging economic development, while others are not? Are there inherent trade-offs between economic growth and democracy, or between development and stability or equality? Are there any universal models countries can apply when seeking development success? These are the sorts of questions that have motivated various analyses and perspectives on the political economy of development. This course is designed as an intensive reading seminar that will help students begin to think seriously and systematically about the most salient theories and debates from the field, with limited looks at particular cases and countries. The countries looked at will be mostly examined in the context of broader theoretical issues and arguments, rather than their intrinsic study, and will be drawn from North America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America.", "name": "Political Economy of Development", "section": "20", "location": "555 Clark B01", "topic": "", "course": "368-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/POLI_SCI/368-0/35517", "instructor": ["William James Hurst"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "35517", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
