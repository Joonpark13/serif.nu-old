[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "How racist is the average American, and what makes some more racist than others? Why can't Democrats and Republicans just get along? Does a country's colonial experience shape its future political and economic possibilities? These questions, and many more, have been addressed by statistical research in political science.<br/><br/>This course explores quantitative/statistical research methods in the social sciences, with the goal of determining what makes a good descriptive or causal inference about politics. For the first half of the course, we will review the basics of statistical theory and quantitative research design. In the second half, we will examine applications of these methods to various topics in political science. For each application, we will consider the technical requirements and properties of the method being employed, as well as the available evidence regarding how these requirements and properties fit with the specific application at hand. With this information, we will determine what we can legitimately claim to have learned from the application and consider alternative designs that might serve to supplement or improve our learning. Students will thus learn how to evaluate other people's statistical work, but also how to design, execute, and interpret their own statistical models.", "name": "Statistical Research Methods", "section": "20", "location": "Frances Searle Building 1421", "topic": "", "course": "312-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/POLI_SCI/312-0/35528", "instructor": ["Jason W Seawright"], "class_attributes": "Formal Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "35528", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
