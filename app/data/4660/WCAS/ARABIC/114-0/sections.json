[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "SPEAKING and UNDERSTANDING\u00a0the way Arabs/Egyptians speak in everyday life is a major goal of this course. In this course students will intensively practice speaking and master using colloquial Arabic for everyday oral communication. They will learn about the intricacies of diglossic sociolinguistic situations through the specific example of Egypt. Students will become familiar with important cultural themes in Arab/ Egyptian society which inform individual and collective behavior. Students will learn to analyze similarities and differences between formal, written \"Modern Standard Arabic\" and the spoken regional Egyptian variety. They will also gain valuable insight into Egyptian and Arab language and culture, laying important groundwork for more successful \"Study Abroad\" or work abroad experiences.\u00a0<br/><br/>Although the focus of this course is building verbal and conversation skills of the students in Egyptian Arabic, a \"contrastive analysis\" and \"comparative dialectology \" between spoken Arabic and MSA will be discussed in a systematic way. The main spoken dialects used in this comparative are the most widespread dialects in the Arab world; the Egyptian and the Levantine.", "name": "Conversation and Culture in the Arab World", "section": "20", "location": "University Library 4670", "topic": "Egyptian Arabic", "course": "114-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ARABIC/114-0/34429", "instructor": ["Ragy H Ibrahim Mikhaeel"], "class_attributes": "Specific requirements in the language<br/><br/>", "id": "34429", "subject": "ARABIC"}]
