Includes independent research projects using the historic 18.5 inch refracting telescope in Dearborn Observatory, that is equipped with a state-of-the-art CCD camera. Topics covered will depend on the instructor, but will typically include most of the following: geometric optics applied to design of optical and X-ray telescopes; diffraction and the Airy disk; radio and optical interferometry and aperture synthesis; adaptive optics; recent developments in detector technology; quantum and thermal noise in astronomy.<br/><br/>Students who wish to enroll in this class must attend the first course meeting, so that we can assign lab groups and carry out hands on training with the equipment."}], "lmod": "2/14/17 6:42 PM (CT)", "subject": "ASTRON"}]
