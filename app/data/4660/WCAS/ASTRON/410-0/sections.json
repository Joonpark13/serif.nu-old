[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Photons are the main messengers of information from our Universe. Astronomers collect photons from cosmic objects and analyze that light to remotely infer the physical conditions in astronomical objects, such as stars, planets, galaxies, or cosmic explosions. Understanding the physical processes that produce electromagnetic radiation and how that radiation propagates from astronomical sources to the Earth are at the very basis of astronomical research. This course aims at developing the theoretical background and tools that scientists need to interpret and model astronomical observations. Students will learn how radiation is produced by moving charges (the synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and Compton scattering processes) as well as by atomic transitions. The students will also learn how radiation is modified by propagation through an intervening plasma and interaction with matter. Astronomical applications include radiation from stars, active galactic nuclei, cosmic explosions, planets, and more.", "name": "Astrophysical Radiative Processes and Transport", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute LG62", "topic": "", "course": "410-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ASTRON/410-0/37188", "instructor": ["Raffaella   Margutti"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37188", "subject": "ASTRON"}]
