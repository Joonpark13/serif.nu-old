[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Overview of the techniques of observational astrophysics. Includes independent research projects using the historic 18.5 inch refracting telescope in Dearborn Observatory, that is equipped with a state-of-the-art CCD camera. Topics covered will depend on the instructor, but will typically include most of the following: geometric optics applied to design of optical and X-ray telescopes; diffraction and the Airy disk; radio and optical interferometry and aperture synthesis; adaptive optics; recent developments in detector technology; quantum and thermal noise in astronomy.<br/><br/>Students who wish to enroll in this class must attend the first course meeting, so that we can assign lab groups and carry out hands on training with the equipment.", "name": "Observational Astrophysics", "section": "1", "location": "Dearborn Observatory 23", "topic": "", "course": "321-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ASTRON/321-0/37011", "instructor": ["Giles A Novak"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37011", "subject": "ASTRON"}]
