Stars are the building blocks of galaxies, they synthesize most elements in the Universe, and are used as tools in astronomical measurements, including cosmological distances (e.g., using Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae). The course is based on undergraduate physics and will emphasize physical understanding and basic principles."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "lectures"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "homework, midterm and final exam"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "1) Astrophysics in a Nutshell: Second Edition, by Dan Maoz.
