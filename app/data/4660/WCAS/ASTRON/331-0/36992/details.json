Topics to be covered include the basics of stars; the evolution of stars on the main sequence; stellar death and stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes); star formation; and the Milky Way and other galaxies. Time permitting, we will also cover the basics of cosmology. The course develops these astronomical concepts starting from undergraduate-level physics."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "lectures"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "homework, midterm and final exam"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Astrophysics in a Nutshell by Dan Maoz, Princeton University Press, ISBN: 978-0691125848"}], "lmod": "2/9/17 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "ASTRON"}]
