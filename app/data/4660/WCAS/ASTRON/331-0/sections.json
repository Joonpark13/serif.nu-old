[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an introduction to several of the main concepts in modern astrophysics, with an emphasis on the physics of stars and their remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes). Stars are the building blocks of galaxies, they synthesize most elements in the Universe, and are used as tools in astronomical measurements, including cosmological distances (e.g., using Cepheid stars and Type Ia supernovae). The course is based on undergraduate physics and will emphasize physical understanding and basic principles.", "name": "Astrophysics ISP", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute L168", "topic": "", "course": "331-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ASTRON/331-0/36992", "instructor": ["Claude Andre   Faucher Giguere"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "36992", "subject": "ASTRON"}]
