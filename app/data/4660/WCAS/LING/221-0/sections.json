[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines the linguistic manifestations of prejudice: the ways in which we judge people by the way they speak, how names and labels affect perception, and how prejudice is encoded and enforced in the language we use. Students will analyze prejudices against the languages/dialects associated with various social groups, with a focus on the United States. We will also explore the language used to express prejudices, from ethnic slurs and other taboo words to gender-biased language.", "name": "Language and Prejudice", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G15", "topic": "", "course": "221-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/LING/221-0/30916", "instructor": ["Erin M.
