[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Hands-on introduction to computational linguistics, viewed from a modern probabilistic perspective. The class begins with an introduction to programming and probability theory, goes through language modeling, hidden Markov models, and syntactic parsing, and ends with state-of-the-art methods in machine translation and<br/>automatic speech recognition. Students will also learn practical skills for extracting information from large linguistic datasets using natural language processing techniques, as well as good programming<br/>practices.", "name": "Introduction to Computational Linguistics", "section": "20", "location": "Meets in Non-General PurposeRm", "topic": "", "course": "334-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/LING/334-0/30920", "instructor": ["Klinton O'Neal Bicknell"], "class_attributes": "Formal Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "30920", "subject": "LING"}]
