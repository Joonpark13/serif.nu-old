[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, a trained tutor provides individualized language study for the purpose of increasing nonnative speakers' proficiency in English, in both academic and everyday contexts. At the beginning of the term, students will complete a needs assessment to determine which aspects of spoken English are most critical for current communication skills. These may include: accent and intelligibility, grammatical errors, sociolinguistic skills, intercultural competence, classroom communication skills, formal and informal writing tasks, and more. Together, the tutor and student will create a set of learning goals for the term. The tutor will then provide appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the linguistic and academic skills needed to improve communicative competence. Tutors may assign additional work to be completed outside of the session. Students will be expected to reflect on their own progress both periodically and at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards learning goals must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.", "name": "Individual Speech and Language Tutoring for Nonnative Speakers of English", "section": "20", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "482-0", "meeting_time": ["TBA"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/LING/482-0/30949", "instructor": ["Kathleen A.D.
