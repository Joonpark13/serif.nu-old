[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is a practical statistics course with emphasis on the application of statistical methods and data analysis techniques to the life sciences. We will cover topics including descriptive statistics, normal distribution, random variables, sampling distribution, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, p-values and multiple correction, linear regression, model selection, diagnostics, logistic regression, contingency tables, resampling, clustering, dimension reduction, and genomics data analysis. In addition to classical parametric statistics (e.g., two-sample t-test), we will also cover nonparametric approaches (e.g., rank-based test) and resampling based approaches (e.g., permutation test) when data do not fit assumptions required by the standard approaches.<br/><br/>*PLEASE NOTE: This course does not count for major or minor credit", "name": "Statistics for Life Sciences", "section": "1", "location": "Frances Searle Building 2370", "topic": "", "course": "332-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/STAT/332-0/38018", "instructor": ["Hongmei   Jiang"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "38018", "subject": "STAT"}]
