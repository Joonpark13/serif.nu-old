The course will cover all major areas of statistical theory including distribution theory, theory of estimation and hypothesis testing, large-sample theory, Bayesian methods, and decision theory. The emphasis will be on those theoretical topics that are used in the development of statistical methods and the application of theoretical ideas to models used in practice, such as normal-theory linear model, will be considered in detail.
