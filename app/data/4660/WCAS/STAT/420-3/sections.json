[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The goal of this course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to statistical theory and methodology at a level not requiring advanced probability theory (i.e. measure theory). The course will cover all major areas of statistical theory including distribution theory, theory of estimation and hypothesis testing, large-sample theory, Bayesian methods, and decision theory. The emphasis will be on those theoretical topics that are used in the development of statistical methods and the application of theoretical ideas to models used in practice, such as normal-theory linear model, will be considered in detail. The course is intended to be useful to students in areas such as engineering and economics as well as students in statistics.", "name": "Intr to Statistical Theory & Methodology", "section": "20", "location": "STAT Sem Rm B02 - 2006 Sher", "topic": "", "course": "420-3", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/STAT/420-3/31020", "instructor": ["Wenxin   Jiang"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31020", "subject": "STAT"}]
