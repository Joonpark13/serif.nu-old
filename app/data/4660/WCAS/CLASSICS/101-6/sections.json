The focus of this class is Chicago, the quintessential modern American city. By analyzing a wide variety of sources, from Eric Larson's No. 1 New York Times bestseller The Devil in the White City to some of the city's most significant skyscrapers, museums, theaters and stadiums, to Spike Lee's controversial film Chi-Raq, we will map the way Chicago's enduring, protean, at times antagonistic dialogue with classical antiquity has shaped the city's look, reputation, and identity.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "1", "location": "University Library 4722", "topic": "Ancient Rome in Chicago", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/CLASSICS/101-6/32705", "instructor": ["Francesca   Tataranni"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>", "id": "32705", "subject": "CLASSICS"}]
