[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Rome: Culture and Empire-Spring 2017<br/><br/>The course is a cultural and historical survey of the Roman Republic and Empire. We will trace the story of how this small city-state in central Italy, on the periphery of the older and wealthier civilizations of Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean, how it established military and political dominance over Italy and the entire Mediterranean, how it administered this vast empire for centuries, and how a long period of crisis lead to its decline, partition into eastern and western halves, and finally to the collapse of its western half. <br/><br/>Woven into this historical narrative, however, we will also ask who these people were, what they believed and cared about, and how they organized their society and conducted their lives. We will read in translation some of their most cherished and prestigious works of literature, observe their achievements in philosophy, science, and the arts, and scrutinize their dreadful glorification of conquest and unchallenged acceptance of slavery. Lectures and sections will alternate between these key events in Roman history and broader topics in the cultures of Rome and the empire.", "name": "Rome: Culture and Empire", "section": "1", "location": "Annenberg Hall G21", "topic": "", "course": "212-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/CLASSICS/212-0/32706", "instructor": ["John Kyrin Schafer"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>Interdisciplinary Distro - See Rules<br/><br/>Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "32706", "subject": "CLASSICS"}]
