[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Griffins, sphinxes, and other fabulous creatures, along with imaginary animals, appear frequently in the art of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Mediterranean world. They stand at the intersection of the normal and abnormal, the natural and unnatural. Why did these images become such favorite subjects for artistic representations, and what do they tell us about the cultures that produced them? Can we connect the invention of supernatural creatures composed from multiple species with key moments in human social and cognitive development, such as the emergence of urban society? Drawing on new perspectives from multiple disciplines, including art history, history, and archaeology, this course explores the phenomenon of the monstrous in ancient art.", "name": "Special Topics in Ancient Art", "section": "1", "location": "University Hall 112", "topic": "Monsters, Art, and Civilization", "course": "319-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ART_HIST/319-0/32431", "instructor": ["Ann C Gunter"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "32431", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
