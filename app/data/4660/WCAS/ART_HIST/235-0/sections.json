[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course surveys art and architecture across Latin America from the sixteenth to the early twentieth centuries. From Mexico and Peru and from the Caribbean to the R\u00edo de la Plata, we will explore buildings and works of art in a variety of media as expressions of complex societies that emerged in the Americas as a result of contact and conquest after 1492. We will encounter artists whose names have been forgotten by history as well as known figures such as Guaman Poma de Ayala, Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando, Diego Rivera, and Frida Kahlo. The course will make use of art collections in the Chicago area for introductory-level research projects. Students are required to attend lectures twice per week, in addition to a weekly Friday section led by a Teaching Assistant. One off-campus visit to the Art Institute of Chicago is also required and other off-campus outings will be encouraged.", "name": "Introduction to Latin American Art", "section": "1", "location": "Block Pick-Laudati Auditorium", "topic": "", "course": "235-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ART_HIST/235-0/32475", "instructor": ["Jesus R Escobar"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>Registration for discussion section required<br/><br/>", "id": "32475", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
