[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Art History 430: Aby Warburg/Atlas<br/><br/>The German art historian Aby Warburg (1866-1929) is well known to art historians, anthropologists, cultural historians, among others. The primary focus of this seminar will be his magnum opus: Mnemosyne Atlas, left unfinished at his death, consisted of panels of photographic reproductions of works of art and other visual materials that he composed in an attempt to map \"the afterlife of antiquity\" (Nachleben der Antike), a generative topos he had pursued since his earliest studies on Renaissance Florentine art. The Atlas survives as a series of pictorial propositions, but was intended to be structured around text as well. How can we understand the format, the function, the value of such an effort today? Warburg is also known for his cosmological interests; his belief that religious studies and art history should operate shoulder to shoulder; and for the institutions that bear his name. His library, which Ernst Cassirer called \"the organon of intellectual-historical studies,\" founded in Warburg's native city Hamburg, survives in London. While directed toward considerations on the Bilderatlas, the seminar will read many of Warburg's key works and critical responses to them, and consider the ongoing impact of his work.", "name": "Studies in Renaissance Art", "section": "1", "location": "Kresge 4354 Art Hist.
