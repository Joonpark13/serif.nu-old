We consider carefully the ways in which these practices speak to local histories and populations as well as to an international audience, and how they draw upon models of utopia, pan-regional politics, subterfuge, and resistance. We will try to determine how these efforts construct specific understandings of a &quot;Middle Eastern&quot; place, whether it be national, cultural, historical, or geographical. In each instance, however, we are less concerned with establishing a singular view regarding the &quot;reality&quot; of a place than with the ways in which its &quot;realities&quot; are constructed and represented culturally, historically, aesthetically, and temporally. Our analyses will be formed in dialogue with interdisciplinary theoretical and analytical texts ranging from art history to political science and anthropology, and we will, on occasion read artists' writings just as we will view their visual work. Topics range from transnational and regional identification, decolonization and anti-imperialism, neoliberalism and globalization, the artistic appropriation of archival traditions, images of state and so-called terrorist violence, public and private arts institutions, dis-placements and territorial control, the use of historical images in modeling visions of the present, and the remembrance of war. Our survey is not comprehensive in either geographical or art historical terms. Instead, we consider several case studies (mostly in the Levant) in order to analyze different ways by which\u00a0places are imagined, dreamed,\u00a0and sometimes destroyed\u00a0across shifting regimes of power and authority. Seminar is conversation based. Juniors and seniors are encouraged to enroll, but sophomores might want to contact the professor. Students are expected to have open minds and, ideally, some exposure to contemporary art, but this is not required. The course also counts for the MENA major."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "DiscussionSeminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationProject, finalWriting assignments"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Readings and most moving image material will be made available online and, if desired by a majority of the students, through a reader for purchase."}], "lmod": "2/8/17 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
