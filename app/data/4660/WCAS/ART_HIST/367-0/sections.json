Beginning with the immediate postwar period through Reconstruction and the present, we will consider how symbols (such as the Confederate flag), images (paintings, photographs, films), objects (souvenirs, commemorative sculpture), and sites (battlefield parks, cemeteries, plantations) have been enlisted in remembering the Civil War. Relying on scholarship about historical memory, we will study how representations of this pivotal event in American history have been shaped by northern and southern whites as well as by African-Americans, aiming to understand the significance of different memories to different groups at specific historical moments. Background on the Civil War is helpful but not necessary; we'll be building our historical knowledge of the war and its aftermath as we examine Civil War memory-making.
