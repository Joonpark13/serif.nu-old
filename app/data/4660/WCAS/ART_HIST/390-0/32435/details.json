Themes to be addressed may include sustainability, materiality, labor, and recycling; how artists collaborate with natural processes; how art can address crises such as industrial toxins and global warming; and the place of human ecologies and political struggles in relation to gender, race, poverty, territory and indigeneity. The class will involve some film screenings, meetings with artists, and field trips outside of class hours. In particular, a required field trip (all expenses paid by the Art History Department's Warnock Fund) to Carbondale, in downstate Illinois, will be held from the afternoon of Thursday, May 11 to the morning of Sunday, May 14. Students must be available for this trip in order to take the class."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "DiscussionSeminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationGroup projectPaper, finalWriting assignments"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Amanda Boetzkes.\u00a0The Ethics of Earth Art\u00a0(Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2010) ISBN: 978-0816665891; A.
