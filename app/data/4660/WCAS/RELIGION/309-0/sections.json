[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course investigates two of India's major epics: the <i>Mahabharata</i> and the <i>Ramayana</i>. We will approach these texts as classic works of literature and as religious texts that play important roles in the lives of practicing Hindus. We will begin by reading parts of the <i>Ramayana</i> paying particular attention to the ideals of kingship, love, good and evil, and the status of women in the text. We will study the differences between various versions of the Ramayana story throughout Asia, including modern televised versions and the animated film \"Sita Sings the Blues.\" We will also be thinking about this text's role in religious practice as well as South Asian politics. In the second half of the course, we will turn to the <i>Mahabharata's</i> epic tale of battle. Approaching it first from a literary angle, our conversation will focus on the ethical debates within the text, in particular how the <i>Mahabharata</i> raises questions about the ideals of kingship and kinship, the justice of war, and the roles of women in the text. We will then address the religious dimensions of the text and study closely to the famous Bhagavad Gita, attending to that work's philosophy and impact on South Asian religious thought, as well as political thought in the writings of Gandhi. The course reading will include segments of the original texts in translation, a smattering of scholarly articles, and plenty of video clips, photographs, and newspaper articles from South and Southeast Asia that reveal these living epics' enduring legacy.", "name": "Topics in Hinduism", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-410", "topic": "Gods, Demons, and their Games of Thrones, The Livi", "course": "309-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/RELIGION/309-0/37919", "instructor": ["Charles Scott Preston"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37919", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
