Themes addressed are: the secularization of the modern West, economics, political theology, philosophy of religion (Kant and Hegel), anti-Semitism, reason and the will, modern subjectivity, the arts. The course aims to show how religion and theology are related to broader cultural, political, social, and aesthetic issues.
