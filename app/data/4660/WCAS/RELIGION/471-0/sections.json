[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "<strong>The Colonial Project. European Expansion and the Development of the Colonial/Postcolonial World</strong><br/> <br/>In this seminar, we will read in the history of comparative colonialisms from 1492 to the middle of the 20th century. We will privilege the history of Spanish and British trade and territorial expansion in Africa, the Americas, and India.<br/> <br/>The required texts will focus on communication, conversion, cultural conflicts, knowledge systems, the development of ethnic and racialized systems of rule, and nationalist struggles (see below). In addition, we will read essays that attend to trade-networks and economic transformations. <br/> <br/>For students whose research interests pertain to colonialism, empire, globalization, and anti-colonial nationalisms, the seminar will furnish them with a foundation to begin to compare similarities and differences in the history of 450 years of European colonial expansion. Additionally, I will provide (and we will build together) an extensive bibliography that will be useful to those who wish to construct an exam field related colonialism, empire, and globalization.", "name": "Studies in History of Religions", "section": "20", "location": "University Library 4670", "topic": "The Colonial Project: European Expansion and the D", "course": "471-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/RELIGION/471-0/31086", "instructor": ["J Michelle   Molina"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31086", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
