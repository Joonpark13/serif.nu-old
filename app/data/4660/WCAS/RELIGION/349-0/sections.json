[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The primary questions addressed in this course have to do with relations between economics and religion. These questions have attracted attention because of Max Weber's analysis of modernity in terms of the impact of Calvinist theology on modern capitalism. Yet Weber's is only one of many important studies that have considered the way in which religion shapes a particular understanding of economics. In this course we will look at key texts in the west that have contributed religious and theological ways of thinking about economics. Questions discussed will consider the Bible in relation to economic exchange, how God's play a role in capitalism, religion in relation to critiques of economic exploitation, and proposals for economic justice as informed by religious commitments. Texts by the following authors will be studied: Martin Luther, Martin Luther King Jr., Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Max Weber, Georg Simmel, and Hannah Arendt. Class evaluation is based on study guides and reflections, class participation, and a written paper.", "name": "Topics in Christianity", "section": "20", "location": "Crowe 4-130 Rel Studies Sem Rm", "topic": "Economics and German Culture", "course": "349-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/RELIGION/349-0/31076", "instructor": ["Christine M Helmer"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "31076", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
