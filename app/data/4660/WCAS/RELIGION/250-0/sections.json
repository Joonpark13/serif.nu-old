[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course introduces Islam, one of the major religious traditions of world history. We will develop a framework for understanding how Muslims in varying times and places have engaged with Islamic scripture and the prophetic message of the Prophet Muhammad through diverse sources: theological, philosophical, legal, political, mystical, literary and artistic. While we aim to grasp broad currents and narratives of Islamic history, we will especially concentrate on the origins and development of the religion in its formative period (the prophetic career of the Prophet Muhammad, the Qur'an, Islamic belief and ritual, Islamic law, and popular spirituality) and debates surrounding Islam in the contemporary world (the impact of European colonialism on the Muslim world, the rise of the modern Muslim state, and discourses on gender, politics and violence).", "name": "Introduction to Islam", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute L211", "topic": "", "course": "250-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 11:00AM - 12:20PM", "Th 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/RELIGION/250-0/31066", "instructor": ["Brannon Dobbs Ingram"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "31066", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
