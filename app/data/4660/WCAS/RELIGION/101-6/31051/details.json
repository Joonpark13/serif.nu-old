There are many expectations that parents and society place on the college experience. But now that we are in college, how shall we think about it? Is it an experience or is it an education? Is it a ticket to a job or is it the pursuit of knowledge? What do professors do anyway? How is contemporary culture reflected in the university? We address various facets of the college experience, from student life to the value of the humanities. We survey the history of the modern university and learn about the &quot;crisis&quot; of the contemporary university. The goal is to reflect more deeply at the beginning of college what the &quot;experience&quot; is all about."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Freshmen and Sophomores<br/>Add Consent: Department Consent Required<br/>Drop Consent: Department Consent Required"}], "lmod": "2/21/17 6:51 PM (CT)", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
