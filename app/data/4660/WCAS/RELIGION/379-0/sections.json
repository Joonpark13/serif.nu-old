We will begin by a review of justice theory within the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament and the Quran, and explore how the concepts of fairness, treatment of the vulnerable, equity, freedom, rights and contracts expand our historical ideas about how to distribute social goods in a world of scarcity and finitude beginning with Enlightenment ideas of fairness. We will critically examine the turn toward utility and happiness, then contract theories of justice as modernity expanded our ideas of fairness. We will explore contemporary theories of justice, including Rawl and his critics, and Singer, Nussbaum. Sachs, and challenges to liberal theorists by liberation theology, African American political theory, and feminist critique. The class will conclude with an exploration of how justice theories are applied in practical terms against problems of access and distribution in American public life.<br/><p>Counts towards the <a href=\"http://www.religion.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/major/interdisciplinary-concentrations/religion-law-politics.html\">Religion, Law and Politics (RLP) </a> major concentration.</p>", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Topics in Comparative Religion", "title": "WCAS RELIGION 379-0-21 Topics in Comparative Religion", "lmod": "2/22/17 6:51 PM (CT)", "section": "21", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Laurie S Zoloth", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "Life is not Fair: Theories and Practices of Justi", "course": "379-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Life is not Fair: Theories and Practices of Justice<br/><br/>This course will look at historical and comparative theories of justice from theological and philosophical sources in the Western Tradition.
