Drawing from an array of interdisciplinary sources, we will look at such areas as: the cult of personality in the media age; religion, media, and changing platforms of authority; the religious dimensions of transmedia storytelling, media world-building, and intersectionality; religion as communication; online group identity formation, religio-political identity construction, and the culture of surveillance; code-switching, consumerism, and blurred boundaries of &quot;the sacred and the secular;&quot; virtual religion, and how a better understanding of intermediality in the digital age might inform our theoretical understandings of religion. Students will be asked to conduct original research, compose a final seminar paper, and to present their research in a conference-like format at the conclusion of the course. Students will also receive guidance as to key professional organizations, guilds, research centers, and journals that support work in our field."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Coursepack"}], "lmod": "2/6/17 8:44 AM (CT)", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
