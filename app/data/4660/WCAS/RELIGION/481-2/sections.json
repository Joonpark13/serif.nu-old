[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this graduate seminar, we explore exciting contemporary work being produced at the intersections of religious studies and cultural studies, with an eye toward visual culture, new technologies, and the dynamics of participatory culture. Drawing from an array of interdisciplinary sources, we will look at such areas as: the cult of personality in the media age; religion, media, and changing platforms of authority; the religious dimensions of transmedia storytelling, media world-building, and intersectionality; religion as communication; online group identity formation, religio-political identity construction, and the culture of surveillance; code-switching, consumerism, and blurred boundaries of \"the sacred and the secular;\" virtual religion, and how a better understanding of intermediality in the digital age might inform our theoretical understandings of religion. Students will be asked to conduct original research, compose a final seminar paper, and to present their research in a conference-like format at the conclusion of the course. Students will also receive guidance as to key professional organizations, guilds, research centers, and journals that support work in our field.", "name": "Theories of Religion", "section": "20", "location": "University Library 4670", "topic": "", "course": "481-2", "meeting_time": ["Th 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/RELIGION/481-2/31128", "instructor": ["Sarah McFarland Taylor"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31128", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
