The State of Israel defines itself as a Jewish and democratic state. At the same time, about 25 percent of its population is not Jewish, and Jews themselves are divided along ethnic and ideological lines. Among Jews, Sephardim (Jews whose origins trace back to Spain) and Mizrahim (Jews whose origins trace back to the Islamic world) struggled against an Ashkenazi (central and eastern European) elite up through the 1990's, which saw waves of Russian and Ethiopian Jews come to the country. The largest ethnic group among non-Jews is the Arab/Palestinian population, which is divided in terms of religion between Christians and Muslims on the one hand and between Bedouin and settled communities on the other. Armenians, Circassians, and Druze, who often speak Arabic at home but largely do not regard themselves as Arab, likewise occupy a place in Israeli culture and society. In recent decades, immigrants from the Far East and refugees from Africa have added to the rich ethnic tapestry, even as the refugees' arrival has been accompanied by increasing tensions.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The course is multi-disciplinary, exploring both the politics and culture of different minorities in the state. The course therefore devotes time to exploring the cultural productivity of different minority groups within the realms of religion, music, art, literature and cinema. On the political level, the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have often exacerbated tensions between the Arab minority and Jewish majority and between Jews, Christians, and Muslims, and likewise have divided these groups amongst themselves. At the same time, religious minorities have official recognition in certain spheres of life. Therefore, this course also explores the often frayed - and at other times close -relationships between, among, and within these different groups. We will try to ascertain to what extent Israel manages the tensions between these groups, what responsibilities minority groups have to the larger society and the larger society toward minorities, to what extent the tensions within Israel are/are not a microcosm of tensions within the Middle East and even across the world, and to what extent Israel can/cannot serve as a model for the proper balance between minority-majority relations, especially in conflict situations. \u00a0", "name": "Topics in Judaism", "section": "21", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-425", "topic": "Ethnic Communities in Contemporary Israel", "course": "339-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/RELIGION/339-0/31078", "instructor": ["Joseph Tzvi Ringel"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "31078", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
