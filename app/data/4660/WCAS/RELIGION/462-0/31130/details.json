Students will read theoretical and historical studies of Americans religions to engage with several fundamental problems that have commanded recent scholarly attention. How have globalization and hemispheric approaches reshaped the way scholars conceptualize the &quot;origins&quot; and trajectories of American religions? How have formations of US empire shaped religion and politics? What have scholars meant by the &quot;co-constitution&quot; of race and religion, and how has this manifested throughout the history of American religions? What is the &quot;national security paradigm,&quot; and how has it reshaped the relationship between religion and state power? Are recent anti-Muslim state practices a novel development or an iteration of an historical pattern? What analysis of American religions is demanded by accounting for indigeneity? <br/><br/>Students will lead and participate in weekly discussions, write a book review, and produce a research essay of approximately 15 pages that engages with one or more key themes from the seminar."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Ned Blackhawk, Violence over the Land.
