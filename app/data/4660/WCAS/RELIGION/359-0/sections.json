[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This class introduces you to a wide variety of ethnographies on Muslim communities in Asia, both in the range of regions and states - Iran, Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China - as well as in terms of themes - how Muslims engage secularizing states, coexist with hegemonic non-Muslim majorities, survive as refugees on the battleground of rival nation states, and, with native languages other than Arabic, make the Qur'an collectively meaningful.<br/><br/>At the same time, you will sharpen your ability to read and evaluate difficult books. We will analyze the ethnographies as texts to understand how the authors combined different kinds of texts to achieve the effect of a unified ethnographic whole, which different fieldwork activities yielded specific forms of data or emprirical materials, which writing techniques authors used to give voice to different groups of informants, and how authors attempted to represent the hold of the past on the \"now\" of fieldwork.<br/><br/>This class is reading-intensive and will focus on discussion. You will take turns leading discussions. This class works only if you participate actively in discussion. Preparation for class discussion by keeping up with the readings is crucial and will figure into the grading.", "name": "Topics in Islam", "section": "20", "location": "ANTHRO Sem Rm B07 - 1810 Hinmn", "topic": "Islam in Asia", "course": "359-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/RELIGION/359-0/37915", "instructor": ["Stefan   Henning"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "37915", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
