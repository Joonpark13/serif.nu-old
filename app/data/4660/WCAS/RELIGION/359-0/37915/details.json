We will analyze the ethnographies as texts to understand how the authors combined different kinds of texts to achieve the effect of a unified ethnographic whole, which different fieldwork activities yielded specific forms of data or emprirical materials, which writing techniques authors used to give voice to different groups of informants, and how authors attempted to represent the hold of the past on the &quot;now&quot; of fieldwork.<br/><br/>This class is reading-intensive and will focus on discussion. You will take turns leading discussions. This class works only if you participate actively in discussion.
