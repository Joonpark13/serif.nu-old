By working with LiDAR, remote sensing datasets, and Species Distribution Models, students will learn how to optimize visualization and analysis of large geospatial datasets. Students will also learn how to automate their geospatial analysis workflow using Model Builder and Python scripting. These skills will be introduced in the context of exemplar problems in climate science, hydrology, geochemistry, and ecology.
