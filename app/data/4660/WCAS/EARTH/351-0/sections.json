Learn about the formation of planets and their evolution, with our solar system as the prime example.<br/>2.

Understand the origin and history of life on Earth, and the role of extinctions, also the critical role of plate tectonics in forming Earth's surface and in the evolution of the planet.<br/>4. Apply what we know and suspect about Earth to develop hypotheses about the conditions for habitable planets beyond the solar system.<br/>5.
