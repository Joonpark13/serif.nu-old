[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course explores plate tectonics, the primary process driving Earth's evolution and functioning. which makes Earth different from neighboring planets. Topics include how plates move, how their boundaries operate, how these have changed over time, and the resulting natural hazards. Lab will involve learning to use software to describe present and past plate motions.", "name": "Global Tectonics", "section": "01", "location": "Technological Institute F285", "topic": "", "course": "320-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/EARTH/320-0/33137", "instructor": ["Seth A Stein"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33137", "subject": "EARTH"}]
