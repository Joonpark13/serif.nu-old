This course will approach the study of Earth systems from two perspectives: 1) description and classification of Earth's features, including Earth materials, internal structure, and landforms and 2) description and explanation of the physical, chemical and biological processes that form and modify these features. <br/>Topics include minerals; sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks; the interior Earth, oceans, and atmosphere; solid Earth processes, such as volcanism, seismicity, and plate tectonics and their interactions with the atmosphere and hydrosphere to drive surface Earth processes, such as climate, weathering, and glaciation; geologic time; global change. <br/><br/>This course includes a mandatory field trip to Baraboo, Wisconsin"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Two REQUIRED Textbooks: 1) Earth: An Introduction to Physical Geology, 12th Edition.
