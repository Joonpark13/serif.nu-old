[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The objective of this course is to introduce students to the fundamental components of the Earth system-the atmosphere, hydrosphere and solid Earth-and more importantly, examine how these components interact in response to internal and external influences to control climate. Within this Earth systems context, we will explore how climate is changing today, how it has changed (sometimes catastrophically) in the geologic past, and how it may change in the future.", "name": "Climate Catastrophes in Earth History", "section": "01", "location": "Tech Institute Lecture Room 3", "topic": "", "course": "105-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/EARTH/105-0/33183", "instructor": ["Matthew T Hurtgen"], "class_attributes": "Natural Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33183", "subject": "EARTH"}]
