This course builds on Applied GIS by introducing students to more sophisticated methods in raster processing, multi-dimensional data analysis and geostatistics. By working with LiDAR, remote sensing datasets, and Species Distribution Models, students will learn how to optimize visualization and analysis of large geospatial datasets. Students will also learn how to automate their geospatial analysis workflow using Model Builder and Python scripting. These skills will be introduced in the context of exemplar problems in climate science, hydrology, geochemistry, and ecology. Data is primarily analyzed using the professional standard in GIS software?ArcGIS?, though students swill often be using R Studio for statistical analyses and large data downloads. Instruction will assume some prior experience using ArcGIS?, however, no proficiency in the R language is expected of incoming students."}], "lmod": "2/12/17 6:53 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENVR_SCI"}]
