[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course provides an overview of the physical processes governing environmental systems, from the Earth's lithosphere to hydrosphere to atmosphere. We will cover internal and external sources of energy to the Earth system; the processes from tectonic to atmospheric that are driven by that energy; and some human impacts on the resulting environmental systems. Students will gain physical science perspectives on current debates about environmental issues, such as those over water resources, energy, and climate change.", "name": "Earth: A Habitable Planet", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute M345", "topic": "", "course": "201-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENVR_SCI/201-0/33838", "instructor": ["Patricia A Beddows"], "class_attributes": "Natural Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33838", "subject": "ENVR_SCI"}]
