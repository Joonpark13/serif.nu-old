Topics include anthropology's study of gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, economic exchange, kinship and family relations, religious practice, music and art, and medical and applied/development anthropology. We explore three sets of questions through case studies from contemporary cultures worldwide, including our own: 1. How do humans organize their lives? How do social differences and hierarchies impact those lives? 2. How do people relate to one another and create meaning about those relations? and, 3. How do cultures change and travel over time and space? What kinds of solutions can anthropology offer for human problems?"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "You will develop an anthropological point of view that will allow you to analyze human behavior and the world around you from different perspectives.
