[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "For most of its history, the anthropology of religion has focused on what used to be called \"primitive\" religions. In the last few decades, anthropologists have begun to turn their attention more systematically to scriptural religions - Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and Buddhism. First of all, anthropologists have ceased to define their discipline as the study of \"primitive\" peoples. Moreover, many of the peoples they study have by now adopted one or another of these scriptural religions, making their presence difficult to ignore. One way or the other, the anthropological study of scriptural religions raises specific theoretical problems which articulate well with recent trends within the discipline at large. In the first place, any study, anthropological or other, of these religions entails a sensitive understanding of their history. More concretely, the analysis of scriptural religion at any specific place and time entails the investigation of the articulation of a global tradition with its local practice.<br/>The course will focus on four groups of paired readings, centering on the following topics: 1) circumscribing the domain of inquiry 2) colonialism and conversion in the global spread of Christianity 3) forms of piety and their implications 4) secularism and its discontents", "name": "Seminar in Religion and Values", "section": "20", "location": "ANTHRO Sem Rm 104 - 1810 Hinmn", "topic": "", "course": "474-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 2:00PM - 5:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ANTHRO/474-0/32284", "instructor": ["Robert   Launay"], "class_attributes": "Permission of Instructor<br/><br/>Graduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "32284", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
