In our approach we will first examine a few general facts and principles of African history, culture, music, and dance; then explore several specific music cultures from the four major regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. We will study both rural village and urban popular contexts. It is my hope that the students will appreciate the richness and diversity of musical expression in Africa and better understand how music informs and reflects lived reality for its practitioners, merchants, and consumers. This will point to the roles music plays in the culture, history, politics, social relations, rituals, and religious practices of African peoples"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "To gain a general ability to hear and identify elements in musical performance - form, timbre, pitch, rhythm.
