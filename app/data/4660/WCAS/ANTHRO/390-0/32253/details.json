Class texts will explore &quot;risk&quot; through case studies of militarization refugees, and smuggling; child trafficking and forced migration; the politics of commercial surrogacy; and international development and labor exploitation. Drawing on readings from the anthropology of development, international studies, and feminist technoscience studies, students will discuss and question discourses of &quot;globalization&quot; that imagine a world of easy connections and flows, digitally and physically. We engage with multiple media forms, from academic texts, to films like Children of Men and the poetry of Warsan Shire, to explore how migration stories are gendered and racialized, with particular agencies and vulnerabilities, perils and pleasures. By understanding the techniques and technologies of bureaucracy, through examples like airport facial recognition software, so-called &quot;smart walls,&quot; and US counter-terrorism initiatives, students will also assess expert cultures dictating migration and development futures."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "By the end of the semester students will be able to think critically about the relationships between migration policies, border control technologies, and gender, sexuality, race, and knowledge production.<br/>Students will be evaluated based on the following criteria: <br/>Attendance, Preparation, &amp; Participation - 20% <br/>Weekly Response Memos - 30% <br/>Group Presentation - 10%<br/>Rough Draft of Final Paper - 10% <br/>Final Paper - 30%"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Required for Purchase: Mahdavi, Pardis.
