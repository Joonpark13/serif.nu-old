In each of these ways of understanding sexuality, both cultural context and language plays a key role. Linguistic anthropology offers important ways of understanding the concept of sexuality as related to phenomena such as globalization, politics, normativity, violence, intersectionality, and even the ways we think of sexuality in our everyday lives. Using ethnographic examples from the United States, Latin America, Africa, Oceana, and Asia, related to homosexuality, heterosexuality, and other various understandings of sexual identities, practices, and desires, this course uses methods of analysis from linguistic anthropology to understand the variation and meanings of sexuality in a comparative context. Students are evaluated through class participation, presentations, reaction papers, and a final project."}], "lmod": "2/7/17 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
