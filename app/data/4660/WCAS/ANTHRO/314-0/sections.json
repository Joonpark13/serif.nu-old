[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course we will examine human growth and development. By its very nature this topic is a biocultural process that requires an integrated analysis of social construction and biological phenomena. To this end we will incorporate insight from evolutionary ecology, developmental biology and psychology, human biology and cultural anthropology. Development is not a simple matter of biological unfolding from birth through adolescence; rather, it is a process that is designed to be in sync with the surrounding environment within which the organism develops. Additionally we will apply these biocultural and socio-ecological insights to emerging health challenges associated with these developmental stages.", "name": "Human Growth & Development", "section": "20", "location": "ANTHRO Sem Rm 104 - 1810 Hinmn", "topic": "", "course": "314-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ANTHRO/314-0/32330", "instructor": ["Erin Beth Waxenbaum Dennison"], "class_attributes": "Jrs, Srs, Grad Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "32330", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
