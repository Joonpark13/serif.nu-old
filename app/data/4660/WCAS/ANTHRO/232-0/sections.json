[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an introduction to three of the leading theories about the nature and meaning of myth: psychoanalytic, functionalist, and structuralist. Each of these three approaches will be considered primarily through the writings of their respective founders: Sigmund Freud, Bronislaw Malinowski, and Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss. Lectures will be primarily concerned with explaining these three theories. Examples of how these theories can be applied to the analysis of specific myths will largely be drawn from the Old Testament Book of Genesis.", "name": "Myth and Symbolism", "section": "21", "location": "Annenberg Hall G15", "topic": "", "course": "232-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ANTHRO/232-0/32246", "instructor": ["Robert   Launay"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "32246", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
