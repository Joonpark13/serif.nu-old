[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This graduate-level seminar is designed for students interested in the historical development of evolutionary theory and current debates within the field. We will begin with a brief survey of the intellectual precursors to Darwin, the legacy of Darwin and Wallace, and the intellectual threads that coalesced in the Modern Synthesis. We will then trace subsequent controversies within evolutionary biology, with a prominent focus on the role of developmental biology, plasticity and behavior as forces of evolutionary change. Controversies in the study of human evolution and the origins of modern human diversity will be used as lenses to explore these evolutionary themes. This will be a reading intensive course.", "name": "Evolution & Biological Anthropology", "section": "20", "location": "ANTHRO Lab A58 - 1810 Hinmn", "topic": "", "course": "486-0", "meeting_time": ["We 11:00AM - 1:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ANTHRO/486-0/32285", "instructor": ["Christopher W Kuzawa"], "class_attributes": "Permission of Instructor<br/><br/>Graduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "32285", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
