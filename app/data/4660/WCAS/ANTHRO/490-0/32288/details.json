Taking a capacious notion of the aesthetic as related to the senses, cultural forms, and processes of evaluation and judgment, we will explore how various aesthetic realms become sites of everyday domination, for the reworking of social relations, and changing modes of governance and governmentality. This course will be primarily anthropological in nature, with an emphasis on the lived experience of aesthetic categories and processes, on the aesthetic aspects of contemporary social movements, and on provincializing Eurocentric concepts of the aesthetic."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Selected readings may include Abhinavagupta, Al-Farabi, Kant, Elias, Adorno, Hall, Mouffe, Ranciere, Ngai, and writings by contemporary anthropologists."}], "lmod": "2/14/17 6:41 PM (CT)", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
