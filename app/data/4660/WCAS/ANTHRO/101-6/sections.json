[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Did astronauts from another planet establish ancient civilizations on Earth? Were the Americas discovered by Columbus, a Ming dynasty fleet or by Vikings much earlier? Did the Maya Aztec build their pyramids to resemble those of dynastic Egypt? Television is replete with stories of ancient aliens and archaeological mysteries. The impact of such alternative realities on society and history cannot be discounted. They have been used to support nationalistic agendas, racial biases, and religious movements, all of which can have considerable influence on contemporary society.<br/> <br/>In this course, we will study \"fantastic\" stories, puzzles, hoaxes, imaginative worlds and alternative theories. We will learn when, how and what kinds of evidence these alternative theories have used to fascinate the public and illustrate their hoaxes. We will question such theories by using critical thinking and analytical tools to diagnose what is fact and fiction. We will utilize the surviving evidence that archaeologists find to understand cultural contact and interactions.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "21", "location": "ANTHRO Sem Rm 104 - 1810 Hinmn", "topic": "Fantastic Archaeology: Science and Pseudoscience i", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ANTHRO/101-6/32238", "instructor": ["Mark William Hauser"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>", "id": "32238", "subject": "ANTHRO"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will examine the connection between popular culture and politics in the Middle East and North Africa. Popular culture - including films, music, poetry, street art, the internet, and television - has been a critical means for expressing political viewpoints and indeed motivating political action. It has also been used by groups and governments seeking to maintain power and repress populist sentiment. This course will take a careful and critical view of different examples of popular culture from across the region, asking what kind of politics they embody and enable. We will concentrate on what popular culture tells us about social change and hierarchies of power related to nation-states, generations, social class, gender, race/ethnicity, and religion.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "22", "location": "ANTHRO Sem Rm 104 - 1810 Hinmn", "topic": "Popular Culture in the Middle East", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ANTHRO/101-6/32239", "instructor": ["Jessica R Winegar"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>", "id": "32239", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
