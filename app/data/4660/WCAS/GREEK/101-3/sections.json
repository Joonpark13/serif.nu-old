[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course constitutes the third and final course in the year-long, introduction to the ancient Greek language, designed to provide students with the training required to read unaltered ancient texts by the end of the year. Once this course is completed students will be able to progress to courses on such topics as the New Testament, Plato, Homer, the Greek tragedians, and many more. This course, then, builds on the fundamentals of Greek grammar and vocabulary mastered in the previous terms and moves students into the study of more sophisticated constructions and ultimately to unaltered Greek.", "name": "Elementary Greek", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge 4364 Classics Sem Rm", "topic": "", "course": "101-3", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeTh 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/GREEK/101-3/32715", "instructor": ["Ryan Christopher Platte"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "32715", "subject": "GREEK"}]
