In this course we will read significant sections of Homer's Iliad in the original language. Students will develop an ability to read the Homeric dialect and gain an understanding of the conventions of ancient epic poetry. As we explore the earliest European literary work we will also survey several important scholarly issues regarding the nature and history of the poem, including the nature of its composition and its place in ancient Greek society.", "name": "Introduction to Greek Literature", "section": "1", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-435", "topic": "", "course": "201-3", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/GREEK/201-3/32716", "instructor": ["Ryan Christopher Platte"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "32716", "subject": "GREEK"}]
