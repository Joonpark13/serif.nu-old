[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course harbors two primary objectives: 1) to acquaint students with vocabularies and frameworks of argument required to analyze a film sequence in terms specific to that medium; and 2) to familiarize students with a broad range of written texts crucial to the study of cinema, enabling them to render persuasive interpretations and arguments about those texts, as well. The first half of the course will emphasize recent case studies of literature adapted into popular movies, tracking how not just the plots and characters but the perspectives, voices, structures, prose styles, and associated politics of written work get preserved but also transformed on screen, in blatant and subtle ways. In the second half, we will reverse course to examine plays, essays, and other literary works inspired by the movies. We will also explore some classic texts of popular film journalism and scholarly film theory, treating these as two literary and intellectual canons in their own right. Cultivating techniques of close analysis, whether breaking down a film sequence, parsing a scholar's arguments, or negotiating between two versions of the \"same\" story, will be the paramount skill developed in the course, hopefully leading to deeper appreciations of several kinds of texts. Moreover, students will gain a valuable fluency in how to watch, dissect, and debate movies at a time when they still retain enormous cultural sway, both as entertainment vehicles and as venues for sustaining or contesting cultural and political narratives.<br/><br/>Lectures, discussion sections, and assignments will presume no prior coursework in film studies but they will require quick, studious absorption of terms and concepts that might be new. Moreover, the course requires a willingness to put movies and other assigned materials under close analytical pressure, while hopefully retaining the joy of watching, reading, and evaluating them. The syllabus has been streamlined somewhat from previous offerings and skews more heavily (though not exclusively) toward contemporary material, but the expectations of your writing, thinking, and conversation remain high. Movies are many things, but not a vacation!", "name": "Introduction to Film and Its Literatures", "section": "01", "location": "Harris Hall 107", "topic": "", "course": "214-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/214-0/33427", "instructor": ["Nicholas K Davis"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33427", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
