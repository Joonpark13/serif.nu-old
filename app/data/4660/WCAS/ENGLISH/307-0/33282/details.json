This multi-genre creative writing course will investigate how research might be used to generate ideas, to move a creative work forward, and to facilitate revision. Students will learn to use research as an integral component of the creative process rather than as a preamble or an afterthought. Readings, writing assignments, and research assignments will be designed to promote an exploration of how creative writers approach research and how research might manifest differently in poetry, fiction, and nonfiction writing. Students will have the option of writing in one or more genres."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion and practice."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Three short creative works in at least two different genres or one long creative work (delivered in three parts) in one genre."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Readings will include Claudia Rankine, Amy Leach, Renata Adler, David Trinidad, Robin Coste Lewis, Albert Goldbarth, and Anne Carson, among others.
