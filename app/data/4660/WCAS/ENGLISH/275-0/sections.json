[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Asian North Americans are a diverse people with a strange relationship to land: they have been denied citizenship and have been chased from their homes, they have been called \"aliens\" and thought of as \"perpetual foreigners\", they have experienced and maybe perpetrated multiple colonizations of the lands they inhabit, and they are seen as technologically inclined and even robotic. These racialized experiences of place and displacement have been theorized in Asian North American literature and other forms of storytelling. This course will focus on these stories to ask: How have Asian North Americans inhabited the earth through their difference? With topics ranging from citizenship, solidarity, food and resource use, globalization, environmental justice, and the future, these stories will challenge us to think globally as our planet may very well be moving closer to extinction.", "name": "Introduction to Asian American Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 318", "topic": "", "course": "275-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/275-0/33423", "instructor": ["Douglas Sadao Ishii"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33423", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
