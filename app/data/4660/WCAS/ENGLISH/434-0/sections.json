[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course historicizes the inquiry into human and animal relations to explore the implications of history for the interdisciplinary - but still largely presentist - field of animal studies. It will serve both as an account of the impact of the discipline of natural history on early modern English literature and as an introduction to the question of the animal as it is posed in contemporary theorizations of the forms of life.<br/><br/>More pointedly, the course concerns creaturely life, before - and against - the seventeenth-century Cartesian dispensation we have largely inherited, a dispensation which performatively enacted the human/animal divide that it claimed only to describe. As the modern species-definition of the human, the cogito ergo sum doctrine was forged in tandem with a new classification of the animal as la b\u00eate machine, neatly reducing our measure of the forms of life down to two basic kinds: human or non-human, thinking or non-thinking. Does current work in animal studies escape the powerful human/animal binary bequeathed to history by Descartes? And what can texts before Descartes add to the account? How do evolving notions of symbolic language, science, and the power to signify affect this calculus?<br/><br/>At the heart of our inquiry we will consider the great boxing match between Montaigne's longest essay, \"The Apologie for Raymond Sebond\" (1580-92) (which lays out early modern philosophical skepticism based largely on observations of animal cognition) and Descartes's immensely consequential rebuttal in his 1637 Discourse on Method (which outlines in the cogito ergo sum doctrine). Then foraging widely among contemporary theoretical arguments, classical and Renaissance natural history writing, biblical commentary, popularly-disseminated images of Aesop's moral animals, and countless treatments of early modern animals in Shakespeare and others, the course will attempt to reconstruct the early modern textual milieu in which its dramatis animalia can best explode the false simplicity of a human/animal divide.", "name": "Studies in Shakespeare", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 018 English", "topic": "", "course": "434-0", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/434-0/33419", "instructor": ["Laurie J Shannon"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33419", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
