[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "While in the contemporary popular imagination the Arabian Nights is often reduced to a few well-known stories, this course will take a wider approach to the collection, which was compiled over several languages and centuries and contains a wealth of genres, including romance, poetry, fables, jokes, pornography, wisdom literature, and rhetorical debates. Over the quarter, we will read the earliest of these stories, as well as follow the collection's history as the product of a still-ongoing process of circulation and cultural exchange. The last third of the course will therefore be devoted to the modern \"afterlives\" of the collection in novels, film, and theater. We will consider how the Nights has been used in these works as a vehicle for deeply-considered investigations into narrative form but also clich\u00e9d and colonially-imbued images of the Middle East. Reading and watching these works next to and against the Arabic versions, we will encounter the vast variety of ways that the Nights has been a source of narrative techniques, literary themes, political allegories, and feminist debates across literary traditions.", "name": "Studies in Fiction", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 102", "topic": "Arabian Nights", "course": "313-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/313-0/33285", "instructor": ["Rebecca Carol Johnson"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33285", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
