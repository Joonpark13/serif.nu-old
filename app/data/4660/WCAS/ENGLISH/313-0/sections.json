[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "While in the contemporary popular imagination the Arabian Nights is often reduced to a few well-known stories, this course will take a wider approach to the collection, which was compiled over several languages and centuries and contains a wealth of genres, including romance, poetry, fables, jokes, pornography, wisdom literature, and rhetorical debates. Over the quarter, we will read the earliest of these stories, as well as follow the collection's history as the product of a still-ongoing process of circulation and cultural exchange. The last third of the course will therefore be devoted to the modern \"afterlives\" of the collection in novels, film, and theater. We will consider how the Nights has been used in these works as a vehicle for deeply-considered investigations into narrative form but also clich\u00e9d and colonially-imbued images of the Middle East. Reading and watching these works next to and against the Arabic versions, we will encounter the vast variety of ways that the Nights has been a source of narrative techniques, literary themes, political allegories, and feminist debates across literary traditions.", "name": "Studies in Fiction", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 102", "topic": "Arabian Nights", "course": "313-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/313-0/33285", "instructor": ["Rebecca Carol Johnson"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33285", "subject": "ENGLISH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will examine the intersections between Native American novels and protest movements in the twentieth century, by reading established and emerging Native American novelists, from Sherman Alexie and Louise Erdrich to Melissa Tantaquidgeon Zobel and Diane Glancy. When N. Scott Momaday won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1969 for his novel House Made of Dawn, a book that is said to have begun the \"Native American Renaissance,\" Native activists were occupying Alcatraz. They were followed a few years later by American Indian Movement activists, who occupied Wounded Knee Reservation. More recently, Melissa Tantaquidgeon Zobel published her futuristic novel Wabanaki Blues shortly before water protractors established a camp to protest the Dakota Access pipeline. We will explore the shared histories of Native American protest and novels, examining how literature participates in, is indebted to, and inspires activist movements, from anti-removal novels in the early twentieth century to AIM in the 1960s and 1970s to #noDAPL in the twenty-first century. This course will consider various novelistic genres, from young adult fiction, to speculative fiction, to graphic novels and detective stories.", "name": "Studies in Fiction", "section": "21", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "313-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/313-0/38017", "instructor": ["Kelly E Wisecup"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "38017", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
