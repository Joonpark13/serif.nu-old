[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The 20th century British poet and literary critic T. S. Eliot wrote that one \"must know all of Shakespeare's work in order to know any of it.\" This course takes a journey along the whole of Shakespeare's plays that will enable us to ask: what do we learn when we pursue this comprehensive perspective? As Eliot puts it, \"The standard set by Shakespeare is that of a continuous development from first to last\" that ultimately becomes a display of Shakespeare's \"power of development.\" In various ways we will consider what generates this power and what role different genres at different moments may play in activating this ongoing process. What stories do we see when we imagine the Shakespeare corpus as incremental narratives? How does Shakespeare's use of generic form change over time? How does the overall sequence of these changes create strikingly different endings and outcomes?", "name": "Special Topics in Shakespeare", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 122", "topic": "The Whole Journey", "course": "339-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/339-0/33287", "instructor": ["Peter B Erickson"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33287", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
