[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines the framing of crises in history, the media, politics, and public opinion. What are the stakes? Who are the stakeholders? Why and how does a sense of urgency upset some prevailing sense of normalcy? We will interrogate presentations of discrete events (like the Cuban Missile Crisis) and broader trends (like the Crisis in the Humanities) as a crisis of some kind. Students will co-construct a typology of crises to inform ongoing coursework. In addition, they will focus on how to write analytically about crises, whether real, imagined, or fabricated. Finally, students will conduct research into a \"crisis\" of their own choosing and communicate the findings and their significance via oral and written communication.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "21", "location": "Shepard Hall B08/B09", "topic": "Making Sense of Crises", "course": "105-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/105-6/35058", "instructor": ["Bradley S Zakarin"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "35058", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
