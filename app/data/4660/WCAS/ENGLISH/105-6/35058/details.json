What are the stakes? Who are the stakeholders? Why and how does a sense of urgency upset some prevailing sense of normalcy? We will interrogate presentations of discrete events (like the Cuban Missile Crisis) and broader trends (like the Crisis in the Humanities) as a crisis of some kind. Students will co-construct a typology of crises to inform ongoing coursework. In addition, they will focus on how to write analytically about crises, whether real, imagined, or fabricated. Finally, students will conduct research into a &quot;crisis&quot; of their own choosing and communicate the findings and their significance via oral and written communication."}], "lmod": "2/7/17 6:42 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
