[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The digital \"social media revolution\" has been a powerful one, fundamentally changing how we communicate and interact with each other. To help you better understand the fascinating, often fraught relationship between media and social identity, this course will explore the history of \"popular\" media by comparing and contrasting today's with that of another revolutionary era, sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England. We will examine various types of media that were in some sense \"popular\" or \"social\" in early modern England (commercial drama, including Shakespeare; broadside ballads; manuscript miscellanies) alongside twenty-first-century popular media (Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr, as well as television, film, and music). We will ask: in what ways does medium affect how we understand a text? How do different forms of media change the ways readers perceive themselves, or how communities interact? What does it mean for a medium to be \"popular,\" and what makes a medium social? In the process of developing a research project that culminates in a paper of 12-15 pages, students will have the opportunity to conduct archival research, practice navigating electronic databases, write abstracts and research proposals, create an annotated bibliography, and produce peer reviews.", "name": "Research Seminar for Literature Majors", "section": "20", "location": "Parkes Hall 213", "topic": "Early & Modern Social Media", "course": "397-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/397-0/33421", "instructor": ["Rebecca Lynn Fall"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33421", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
