[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an introduction to the early English literary canon, extending from the late medieval period through the eighteenth century. In addition to gaining a general familiarity with some of the most influential texts of English literature, we will be especially interested in discovering how literary texts construct, engage in, and transform political discourse. What kinds of political intervention are literary texts capable of making? What are the political implications of particular rhetorical strategies and generic choices? How do literary texts encode or allegorize particular political questions? How, at a particular historical moment, does it become possible to ignore or overlook the political projects embedded in these texts? In readings of Chaucer, More, Sidney, Shakespeare, Milton, Behn, and Swift, among others, we will consider how important it is to understand these texts from a political perspective, and wonder why this perspective is so often ignored in favor of psychologizing and subjectivizing readings.", "name": "British Literary Traditions", "section": "01", "location": "Harris Hall L07", "topic": "", "course": "210-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/210-1/33272", "instructor": ["Kathryn Sydney Evans"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33272", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
