Can we rewrite this archive using tactics found in contemporary art and poetry? This class follows emerging trends in art and writing to construct new approaches to historical objects that are equally likely to appear on Soundcloud, in a PDF, through online videos, or even on Facebook. Studying the digital humanities alongside modes of contemporary art and letters, we'll reimagine historical works through today's emerging forms and formats. Through readings and class visits from artists and poets, we will explore works that translate established forms into a variety of new media formats. How might Twitter facilitate works of art? What does YouTube demand of poetry? Using a combination of seminar conversations and collaborative workshops, we'll engage in a series of weekly experiments that attempt to reconfigure the history of art and literature through the filter of contemporary writing tools. No previous training in art, poetry, or new media is required."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar conversations, online threads, individual and collective creative workshops."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Collaboration, participation, short weekly experiments, and a final project in the form of a website."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "All theoretical and critical readings will be made available online, with a focus on conversations within the digital humanities, new media art, and contemporary poetics.
