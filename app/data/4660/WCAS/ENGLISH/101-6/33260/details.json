We'll also read a series of essays on Internet cats, all to investigate how our obsessions intersect with issues of taste (what we think of as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;). People can be obsessed with websites (like Facebook), celebrities, TV shows, hobbies, foods, pets, a boyfriend or girlfriend, a place?any number of things. In this seminar, we'll look at the ways in which individual obsessions sometimes intersect with broader social or cultural concerns, and we'll read excerpts from the writings of notorious and talented obsessives. We'll also examine what obsessions can (or maybe cannot) tell us about other people and about ourselves: who we are, what we want, what we're afraid of, what we're drawn to, where we've been, where we're going."}], "lmod": "2/6/17 8:40 AM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
