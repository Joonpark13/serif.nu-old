What responsibilities arise from living in a particular place? What ongoing psychological, social, and physical effects does the past have on the present? What is the role of literature in responding to historical wounds? These questions will guide our study of the relationships between the Sand Creek Massacre and Northwestern. The massacre took place on November 29 1864, in when US soldiers killed about 150 peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho men, women, and children who had placed themselves under US protection. At the time, the territorial governor and superintendent of Indian affairs for Colorado was John Evans, also one of Northwestern's founders. Although Congressional review committees and soldiers who had been at Sand Creek subsequently agreed that a massacre took place, Evans never acknowledged the massacre as such or acknowledged his own culpability. Meanwhile, Cheyenne and Arapaho descendants of survivors of the massacre continue to experience the effects of historical trauma. After years of silence, the University has recently begun to take a new approach to Sand Creek and its own history by accounting for its founder's role in the massacre and establishing dialogue with the Cheyenne and Arapaho. This course will take up these connections between the massacre and the university to explore relations between colonialism and education; historical trauma and &quot;reconciliation.&quot; We will read firsthand accounts of the massacre alongside Native American literatures that represent historical trauma and healing; the university's official report on Evan's involvement; and readings on historical trauma; healing; and reconciliation."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Writing assignments; discussion; oral presentations; library research assignments.<br/><br/>Regular posts on Canvas<br/>Short essay: 2-3 pages<br/>Research summary: 2-3 pages<br/>Paper 1: 4-5 pages<br/>Paper 2: 4-5 pages"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Simon Ortiz, from Sand Creek<br/>Readings in course reader:<br/>Selections from Ari Kelman, A Misplaced Massacre<br/>Selections from Boyd Cothran, Remembering the Modoc War: Redemptive Violence and the Making of American Innocence<br/>Selections from Dian Million, Therapeutic Nations: Healing in an age of Indigenous Human Rights<br/>Toni Jensen, &quot;New or Used&quot; in Denver Quarterly<br/>John Evans Study Committee Reports (NU and DU)<br/>Selected writings by John Evans<br/>Selected readings on historical trauma"}], "lmod": "2/12/17 6:52 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
