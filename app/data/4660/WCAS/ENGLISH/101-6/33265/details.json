In particular, we will look at the role and function of cartoons in teaching the performance of race. In this class we will trace the development of animation from its roots in blackface minstrelsy at the turn of the 19th century to the decline of the &quot;Saturday Morning Cartoon Line up&quot; at the end of the 1990s. Using cartoons as our object, the aim of this course is to develop our skills as a readers, writers, and observers. Through a series of writing exercises we will think about how &quot;uncritical&quot; or popular objects such as animation cartoons hold important critical content for understanding race, childhood, and life."}], "lmod": "2/14/17 6:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
