It puts literature, gender, and psychoanalysis into dialogue by focusing on the question-and art-of interpretation. Taking as our primary interest the scope and force of fantasy, aesthetics, and the unconscious, we'll study some of Freud's most intriguing essays on these topics before turning to broader questions about perspective and meaning that arise in several fascinating works by Victorian and modern writers."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar-style discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Canvas posts, one short analytical paper, a final essay, and in-class participation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Lewis Carroll, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass (ISBN 9780141439761); Henry James, Turn of the Screw (ISBN 0312597061); Joseph Conrad, The Secret Sharer (ISBN 0486275469); Virginia Woolf, Jacob's Room (ISBN 0140185704); Katherine Mansfield, Selected Stories (ISBN 0393925331); and H.
