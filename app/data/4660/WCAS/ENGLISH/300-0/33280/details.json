In this course, we will explore possession as a nexus for studying crucial questions literature stages regarding autonomy and ownership, gender and sexuality, and national and personal identity. Beginning with the divine frenzy that Plato writes possesses good poets, we will then investigate more threatening spectacles of witchcraft and possession in the Renaissance, including William Shakespeare's Macbeth and selections from Aldous Huxley's The Devils of Loudon (1952), a non-fiction novel on a famous case of reported demonic possession in early modern France. We will go on to study possessions and hauntings staged in gothic fiction, including short stories by Edgar Allen Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Daphne du Maurier's novel, Rebecca (1938). The course concludes by studying being denied self-possession by another person, society, or the legacy of a haunting past in Toni Morrison's Beloved (1987) and selections from Natasha Trethewey's Native Guard (2008) and Thrall (2012). These texts invite analysis of the complicated dynamics of possession between the individual and society, lover and beloved, and past and present; each also invites inquiry into how possession informs what it means to read, write, or claim ownership of narrative. Throughout the course, students will develop analysis and argumentation skills through writing and revising essays on texts from different literary genres. Students will also learn how to interpret texts in conjunction with major schools of thought in literary criticism and theory."}], "lmod": "2/8/17 6:42 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
