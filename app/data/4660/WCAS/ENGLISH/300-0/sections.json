[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course serves as an introduction to several schools of psychoanalytic literary theory. It puts literature, gender, and psychoanalysis into dialogue by focusing on the question-and art-of interpretation. Taking as our primary interest the scope and force of fantasy, aesthetics, and the unconscious, we'll study some of Freud's most intriguing essays on these topics before turning to broader questions about perspective and meaning that arise in several fascinating works by Victorian and modern writers.", "name": "Seminar in Reading and Interpretation", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L04", "topic": "Psychoanalytic Thry, Gend & Lit", "course": "300-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/300-0/33279", "instructor": ["Christopher   Lane"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33279", "subject": "ENGLISH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What does it mean to be possessed by a divine or demonic spirit, another person, or the past? In this course, we will explore possession as a nexus for studying crucial questions literature stages regarding autonomy and ownership, gender and sexuality, and national and personal identity. Beginning with the divine frenzy that Plato writes possesses good poets, we will then investigate more threatening spectacles of witchcraft and possession in the Renaissance, including William Shakespeare's Macbeth and selections from Aldous Huxley's The Devils of Loudon (1952), a non-fiction novel on a famous case of reported demonic possession in early modern France. We will go on to study possessions and hauntings staged in gothic fiction, including short stories by Edgar Allen Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Daphne du Maurier's novel, Rebecca (1938). The course concludes by studying being denied self-possession by another person, society, or the legacy of a haunting past in Toni Morrison's Beloved (1987) and selections from Natasha Trethewey's Native Guard (2008) and Thrall (2012). These texts invite analysis of the complicated dynamics of possession between the individual and society, lover and beloved, and past and present; each also invites inquiry into how possession informs what it means to read, write, or claim ownership of narrative. Throughout the course, students will develop analysis and argumentation skills through writing and revising essays on texts from different literary genres. Students will also learn how to interpret texts in conjunction with major schools of thought in literary criticism and theory.", "name": "Seminar in Reading and Interpretation", "section": "21", "location": "University Hall 118", "topic": "Possession", "course": "300-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/300-0/33280", "instructor": ["Whitney Blair Taylor"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33280", "subject": "ENGLISH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "One of the main projects of modern Western culture has been the attempt to conceptualize the realm called Nature and, in particular, to define the relation of the \"natural\" world to the human one. In the course of the past several centuries, often sharply incompatible versions of Nature have been produced by the sciences, philosophy, religion, and the various imaginative arts. We will trace a series of these competing visions of Nature and the natural, focusing on the arrays of rhetorical and artistic methods that have been employed to promote each one at the expense of its rivals. The guiding idea of the course is that Nature is not so much a definite area of reality as a malleable imaginary construct invented and forever re-invented for historically variable reasons. The focus in this seminar falls on the nineteenth century, where ideologies of Nature took particularly distinct forms, but we will cover earlier and later materials as well, including an experimental video (wild hogs in a supermarket) and at least one film.", "name": "Seminar in Reading and Interpretation", "section": "22", "location": "Harris Hall L04", "topic": "Imaginary History of Nature", "course": "300-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/300-0/33281", "instructor": ["Christopher   Herbert"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33281", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
