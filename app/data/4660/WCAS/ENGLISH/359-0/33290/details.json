Because of their talent and premature deaths, that fascination has grown into a full-scale mythology that celebrates their genius and apparent isolation on the Yorkshire moors. Like all myths, this one contains an element of truth, but it has also hampered readers wanting a deeper understanding of their artistic strengths and intellectual perspectives. In this course, we will not ignore the mythology, but we'll try to set it aside to study how several remarkable novels and poems by Anne, Emily, and Charlotte Bront\u00eb advanced a powerful critique of Victorian society, including its almost unbridled support for industrialization, its intensive focus on domesticity and marriage (and related laws), and its judgments against single women. We will also trace the formal development of their fiction, including its debt to Romanticism, its preoccupation with narrative voice, its commitment to partial detachment, and its movement toward a distinctly &quot;modern&quot; narrative, full of intriguing philosophical riddles."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar-style discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Canvas posts, one short analytical paper, a final essay, and in-class participation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Anne Bront\u00eb, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (ISBN 9780140434743); Emily Bront\u00eb, Wuthering Heights (ISBN 9780141439556); Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Jane Eyre (ISBN 9780141441146); and Villette (ISBN 9780375758508).
