The focus will be the classical tradition, the biblical tradition, and Shakespeare who inherited both and reworked them in the early modern period. The trial of Socrates, the trial of Jesus, biblical prophecy, tragedy in Aeschylus and Shakespeare, and a modern work by Melville will be included. Our exploration will be done in the context of theories of justice, and we will read those theories alongside the literature. But we will also heed how literature itself offers elaborations of theories of justice, following their consequences both within legal frameworks and beyond, as they shape the public and intimate lives of people. We will ask how religious ideas of justice inform and depart from secular ideas of justice, how retributive and distributive ideas of justice are imagined and critiqued, and how the relation between justice and law has been conceived."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Discussion and papers."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Excepts from Plato, Aristotle, The Eumenides, Romeo and Juliet, excerpts from Rawls, Kymlicka, Political Philosophy."}], "lmod": "2/6/17 6:42 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
