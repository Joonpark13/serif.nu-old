[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Anxiety about \"bad girls\" and rebellious women has a very long history. We have all heard the old question: why do \"good girls\" go \"bad\"? But what makes a woman \"good\" or \"bad\" in the first place? What is a \"bad girl,\" anyway? This course will examine dramatic representations of unruly, cruel, and otherwise tough women as they appear in Renaissance English drama. We may consider the luxurious sexuality of Cleopatra in Shakespeare's Anthony and Cleopatra or the stubborn independence?and abusive \"taming\"?of Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew; the cross-dressing, hard-drinking, gutter-dwelling Moll Cutpurse in Middleton and Dekker's The Roaring Girl; and/or the incestuous Annabella in Ford's 'Tis Pity She's a Whore. We will focus on Renaissance texts, but will also ask what \"bad girls\" on the seventeenth-century stage can teach us about the performance of female rebelliousness today by regularly assessing their similarities and dissimilarities from present-day narratives, including Rihanna's self-presentation as \"Bad Gal Riri\" and the tragicomic tales of incarcerated women in Netflix's Orange is the New Black.", "name": "Renaissance Drama", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 122", "topic": "Bad Girls in Renaissance Drama", "course": "332-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/332-0/33286", "instructor": ["Rebecca Lynn Fall"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33286", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
