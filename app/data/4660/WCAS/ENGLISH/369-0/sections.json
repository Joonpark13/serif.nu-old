[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course studies the formal properties in select Anglophone African texts and relates aesthetic choices to identity politics. It considers debates in African writing (e.g., what language the literatures should be written in and who is qualified to respond to it) in the context of 21st-century transnational realities. Important will be the relationship between folkloric devices and modern forms and the use of experimentation to not only generate aesthetic pleasure but also to shield texts from possible censorship. Paying attention to plot, syntax, lexis, and various semantic deviations used to foreground (or underground) aspects of the text, we will read creative works by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Ayi Kwei Armah, Nadine Gordimer, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, among other writers, alongside theoretical materials on African literature and on literary form.", "name": "Studies in African Literature", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 121", "topic": "Form in African Writing", "course": "369-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/369-0/33294", "instructor": ["Evan M Mwangi"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33294", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
