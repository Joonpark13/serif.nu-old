[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Dexter, Raskolnikov, American Psycho. Killers, good and bad, have fascinated us for centuries. Psychologically, morally and philosophically we are drawn to the figure of the killer; we revel in the voyeuristic pleasure of entering the criminal mind while maintaining our own legal and moral codes. In this course we study works of fiction, film and TV that have the killer or murderer as their primary subject. We pose ourselves as investigators and analyze the minds and motives of characters as well as the cultures that generate them. We explore the appeal of the \"moral murderer\" and the \"crime drama\" genre that allow viewers to participate in a criminal act while allowing justice to prevail in the end. Our methods include close reading and traditional textual analysis, but we also borrow the tactic of psychological/behavioral profiling used in the criminal justice system and apply it to our fictional characters and texts.", "name": "Studies in Literature and Film", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 318", "topic": "Criminal Minds", "course": "386-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/386-0/33299", "instructor": ["Sarah   Valentine"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33299", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
