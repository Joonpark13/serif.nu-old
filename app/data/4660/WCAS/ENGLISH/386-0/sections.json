In this course we study works of fiction, film and TV that have the killer or murderer as their primary subject. We pose ourselves as investigators and analyze the minds and motives of characters as well as the cultures that generate them. We explore the appeal of the \"moral murderer\" and the \"crime drama\" genre that allow viewers to participate in a criminal act while allowing justice to prevail in the end.
