Of particular interest will be the ways these writers use the vehicle of popular fiction to explore issues of gender roles and sex relations in a period of rapid cultural change that was fraught with self-contradiction. Sometimes such issues give rise in these novels to scalding satire that contemporary readers found shocking and distasteful; sometimes to a mood of paralyzing depressiveness; sometimes to subtly hilarious comedy; but in all its different modulations, the preoccupation with volatile issues of sex is rarely absent here, and this is where the special accent of the course will fall."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture, discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Assigned work in the course includes class presentations, quizzes, and a term paper."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Readings include some of the most original (and most entertaining) novels of the times: W.
