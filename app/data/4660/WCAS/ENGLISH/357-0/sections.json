[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, which might be titled \"The Golden Age of British Popular Fiction,\" we will read representative works by major British novelists of the nineteenth century other than Dickens, focusing on their analysis of modern social and psychological conditions and on the artistic innovations that these themes generated. Of particular interest will be the ways these writers use the vehicle of popular fiction to explore issues of gender roles and sex relations in a period of rapid cultural change that was fraught with self-contradiction. Sometimes such issues give rise in these novels to scalding satire that contemporary readers found shocking and distasteful; sometimes to a mood of paralyzing depressiveness; sometimes to subtly hilarious comedy; but in all its different modulations, the preoccupation with volatile issues of sex is rarely absent here, and this is where the special accent of the course will fall.", "name": "19th-Century British Fiction", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-425", "topic": "Classic Victorian Fiction", "course": "357-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4660/WCAS/ENGLISH/357-0/33289", "instructor": ["Christopher   Herbert"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33289", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
