This course will investigate captivity narratives that significantly complicate this structure by telling stories of captives who chose to remain with their Native captors, thus transforming stories of captivity into narratives of family. We will read the narratives of \"unredeemed captives\" in order to analyze literary articulations of settler colonialism and to examine the ways that Native American writers took up the form of the captivity narrative to critique colonial and U.S. wars, expansion, and Indian policies. We will track these narratives through multiple editions, in order to illuminate the various purposes to which their editors attempted to put them. A key component of the course will thus be the study of the print culture of captivity narratives and the role it played in shaping their popularity and meanings, as well as the role that unredeemed captivity narratives played in shaping and contesting cultural, racial, and gendered identities in early America.", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Topics in Native American and Indigenous Literatures", "title": "WCAS ENGLISH 374-0-20 Topics in Native American and Indigenous Literatures", "lmod": "2/22/17 6:46 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Kelly E Wisecup", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "Unredeemed Captives", "course": "374-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "One of the most popular literary genres in early America, captivity narratives circulated tales of helpless women torn from their families by allegedly cruel captors.
