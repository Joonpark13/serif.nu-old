This course will explore the ways in which the leading intellectuals of the Renaissance and Early Modern period responded to these changes in their poetry and prose. In particular, we will examine how writers of the age wrestled with the profound challenges that the &quot;Scientific Revolution&quot; posed to religion. How did philosophers such as Descartes and Hobbes explain the role of God in a universe they increasingly regarded as mechanistic? How did poets respond to the age's growing commitment to experimentation, empirical data, and reason as the most reliable guides to truth? Finally, how did radical innovations in science encourage equally radical innovations in politics, religion, and art?"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture with regular discussions."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Grades will be based on one critical response paper (20%), several reading quizzes (25%), one literature review (10%), one 7-9 page research assignment (30%), and participation (15%)."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "John Henry, The Scientific Revolution and the Origins of Modern Science. 3rd edition.
