This course will explore the ways in which the leading intellectuals of the Renaissance and Early Modern period responded to these changes in their poetry and prose. In particular, we will examine how writers of the age wrestled with the profound challenges that the \"Scientific Revolution\" posed to religion. How did philosophers such as Descartes and Hobbes explain the role of God in a universe they increasingly regarded as mechanistic? How did poets respond to the age's growing commitment to experimentation, empirical data, and reason as the most reliable guides to truth? Finally, how did radical innovations in science encourage equally radical innovations in politics, religion, and art?", "qtr": "Spring 2017", "name": "Studies in Renaissance Literature", "title": "WCAS ENGLISH 338-0-20 Studies in Renaissance Literature", "lmod": "2/26/17 6:45 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Glenn F Sucich", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "Magic, Science, & Religion", "course": "338-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "During the Early Modern period in Europe, scientific innovations challenged the received wisdom of the ancients, as well as the authority of the Bible itself, changing the way people imagined the physical world and their relation to the universe.
