[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "Modern biochemical engineering. A discussion of principles involved in using biomolecules (e.g., antibodies, enzymes, DNA) and living organisms (e.g., bacteria, yeast, mammalian cells) for the development and production of biopharmaceuticals. The first half of the course will focus on bioprocess engineering as applied to pharmaceutical protein production. The second half of the course will focus on strategies for designing and constructing biological systems to be more efficient cell factories.", "name": "Analysis of Chemical Process Systems", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "210-0", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MEAS/CHEM_ENG/210-0/36627", "instructor": ["Luis A N Amaral"], "id": "36627", "subject": "CHEM_ENG"}]
