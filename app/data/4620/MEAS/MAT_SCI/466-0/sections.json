[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "At the heart of materials science &amp; engineering the understanding, design and manipulation of &quot;microstructure&quot;, particularly down to nano- and atomic-scale. Naturally, this requires deep understanding of morphology, crystallography, structure, chemistry and electronic structure and associated phenomena at those length scales. This course is about advanced electron-beam based analytical tools and techniques which form the foundation for analysis of materials down to atomic scale. It is meant to be a &quot;practical&quot; and experimentally-driven introduction to diverse analytical techniques and their relevance to emerging materials problems.", "name": "Analytical Electron Microscopy", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "466-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MEAS/MAT_SCI/466-0/32888", "instructor": ["Vinayak P Dravid"], "id": "32888", "subject": "MAT_SCI"}]
