Naturally, this requires deep understanding of morphology, crystallography, structure, chemistry and electronic structure and associated phenomena at those length scales. This course is about advanced electron-beam based analytical tools and techniques which form the foundation for analysis of materials down to atomic scale. It is meant to be a &quot;practical&quot; and experimentally-driven introduction to diverse analytical techniques and their relevance to emerging materials problems."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Topics covered include: STEM imaging, EDS and EELS microanalysis and mapping,<br/>microdiffraction and convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED). The course is<br/>closely coupled with hands-on experimental laboratories consisting of about 5<br/>labs. The course also requires experimental project in group of 2-3 students on<br/>topics related to analytical TEM techniques."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Evaluation is based on homeworks, mid-term, lab work and final experimental<br/>project report as well as presentation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "value": "recommended book is &quot;Transmission Electron Microscopy&quot; David B.
