We will read both classical papers and modern literature, drilling down to the essentials hidden behind cryptic acronyms and exotic-sounding techniques. We will primarily work with literature that has relevance to Materials Science, in particular bio-inspired materials, but will also consider suggestions submitted by participants."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "As part of the assessment, students will write and peer-review chapters of an online textbook.
