In this quarter, the quantum mechanical and statistical concepts developed in 351-1 are applied to the study of such materials-related subjects as electrical properties, optical properties, semiconductor junctions, magnetism, dielectrics, lasers, ferroelectrics, and associated subjects and superconductivity. In all cases, the materials aspect and technological applications of the phenomena are stressed.", "name": "Introductory Physics of Materials", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "351-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MEAS/MAT_SCI/351-2/32808", "instructor": ["Bruce W Wessels"], "id": "32808", "subject": "MAT_SCI"}]
