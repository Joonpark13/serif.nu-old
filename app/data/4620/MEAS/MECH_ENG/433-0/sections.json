[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "This is an advanced class in mechatronic systems prototyping, open to graduate and undergraduate students. In this course you will learn how to design, solder and debug a printed circuit board (PCB), learn advanced digital communication protocols like SPI, I2C and USB, create physical prototypes with a laser cutter and 3d printer, and interface with an Android device. The course will meet twice a week in Ford B100. An assignment will be due in every class. The course will finish with a choice of three-week long projects using all of the skills gained in the first seven weeks of class.", "name": "Advanced Mechatronics", "section": "20", "location": "Ford Eng Design Cntr B100", "topic": "", "course": "433-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:00AM - 10:00AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MEAS/MECH_ENG/433-0/37540", "instructor": ["Nicholas Davenport Marchuk"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "37540", "subject": "MECH_ENG"}, {"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "This is an advanced class in mechatronic systems prototyping, open to graduate and undergraduate students.
