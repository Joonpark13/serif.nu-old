Topics include: theories and techniques of sampling for travel surveys; methods and modes of survey implementation; types of information (revealed, stated or retrospective) collected through different questionnaires; and design of stated preference experiments for discrete choice modelling. Participants will design their own survey step-by step, administer to a sample of respondents and then process and analyze the data. Techniques of data-exploration and modelling using R software, on real survey data, will be taught. Appropriate methods for collecting travel survey data is necessary for planning and management of transportation systems. The knowledge gained from this course is valuable for research and professional practice in transportation planning, operations and management.<br/><br/> <br/>GOALS / <br/>A graduate level course in survey design and data analysis that puts the learning into practice by effectively designing a mini-study including collecting and analyzing data and communicating the results", "name": "Survey methods, data and analysis", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute F279", "topic": "", "course": "473-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 10:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MEAS/CIV_ENV/473-0/37668", "instructor": ["Amanda Irini Blomberg Stathopoulos"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37668", "subject": "CIV_ENV"}]
