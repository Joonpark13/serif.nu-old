[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "? This course will examine the fundamental molecular processes that govern the fate and transformation of organic contaminants in natural environmental systems and engineered treatment processes.<br/><br/>? Thermodynamic principles and molecular property descriptors are used throughout the course to develop predictive relationships for organic contaminant solubility and partitioning between environmental phases (e.g., water, air, biota), sorption to solid surfaces (e.g., soils, sediments, aerosol particles), and transformation processes (e.g., oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, photolysis, biological).", "name": "Environmental Organic Chemistry", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute M120", "topic": "", "course": "370-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MEAS/CIV_ENV/370-0/35392", "instructor": ["Yun   Wang"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35392", "subject": "CIV_ENV"}]
