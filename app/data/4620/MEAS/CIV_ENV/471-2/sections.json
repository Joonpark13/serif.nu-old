[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "As a sequel to CEE ENV 471-I, this course extends transportation systems analysis<br/>to accommodate dynamics in travel demand and network flow and operation and design of urban<br/>transit systems. The primary objective is to introduce the students to the fundamental principles<br/>and mathematical methods that guide these active areas of transportation research and practice.<br/>Students will be exposed to both the classic work and the latest developments in the filed, and<br/>be encouraged to ask and address research questions of their own. The course has three pillars.<br/>The first is the simple and powerful economic model of morning commute problem, which<br/>endogenizes both departure time choice and traffic dynamics. The more general optimization<br/>approach that is built under the umbrella of dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) will also be reviewed<br/>and compared with the morning commute model. The main components of the DTA<br/>approach, including basic traffic flow models, time-depending shortest path problems, and assignment<br/>models, constitute the second pillar of the course. The third pillar of the course is<br/>principles for operating and designing urban transit systems.", "name": "Transportation Systems Analysis 2", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute LG62", "topic": "", "course": "471-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MEAS/CIV_ENV/471-2/35319", "instructor": ["Yu   Nie"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35319", "subject": "CIV_ENV"}]
