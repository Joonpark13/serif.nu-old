[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "he goal of the class is to teach the complete path from part design to manufacturing setup and g-code generation, to proper machine operation and part manufacturing. The final project is an individual project, where students will design and CNC manufacture a part outside of class time. Students will be expected to spend time outside of class using the NX manufacturing software to increase their familiarity with the program.<br/><br/>The first half of the course is intended to give practice in manual manufacturing skills, and the design of a manufacturing process for a prototype. Students will gain practice in general mill and lathe fabrication, including designing multiple parts to be fabricated in manual mill and lathe operations. Development of skills learned in introductory freshman projects will continue, including choosing correct part geometry for manufacturing, reviewing and choosing proper manufacturing steps, tool choice, feed and speed choice, and fixturing of samples.<br/><br/>The second half of the course is equivalent to the DSGN 397 Computer Aided Manufacturing course. With practice in general manufacturing, students will not be held back by lack of skills, and will be able to fully utilize CAM programming and CNC training to create advanced prototypes. This second half of the course will teach the NX6 manufacturing environment to program CNC milling operations, as well as the operation of CNC milling machines. Students will learn the basics of NX manufacturing, various manufacturing steps such as operations, tools, and geometry, and the generation of g-code to machine a part. The class will then transition to machine shop lessons, where students will be taught safe operation of CNC milling center.<br/><br/>Weekly homework will involve practice in manual manufacturing and part correction, simple part fabrication, programming manufacturing operations in NX, and G-code generation on various parts.", "name": "Design for Fabrication: NX", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "346-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:30PM - 9:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MEAS/DSGN/346-0/35144", "instructor": ["Michael Joseph Beltran"], "id": "35144", "subject": "DSGN"}]
