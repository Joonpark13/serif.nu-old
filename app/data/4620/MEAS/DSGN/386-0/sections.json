[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, a hands-on design project addresses relevant manufacturing engineering design topics such as automation, quality control, process planning, tooling design, concurrent engineering, and continuous improvement.<br/><br/>Production system design is a major focus of the course, specifically assembly, unit manufacturing processes (e.g., machining, sheet metal working, and welding), material handling, material storage, product design for manufacture and assembly, and product and process design for quality. For process design analysis and optimization, you will use FactoryCAD, FactoryFLOW, and FactoryVIEW.", "name": "Manufacturing Engineering Design", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "386-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MEAS/DSGN/386-0/35109", "instructor": ["Daniel P.
