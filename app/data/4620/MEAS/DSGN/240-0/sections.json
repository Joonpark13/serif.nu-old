[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "Solid modeling covers the principles of creating three dimensional shapes through two dimensional sketches, then combining individual parts into assemblies. Students will review CAD modeling theory and learn the various advantages and disadvantages of modeling objects using different approaches for creating identical features. A balance between lecture and hands-on software use will allow you to familiarize yourself with Solidworks. This is an introductory class.
