[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "Cellular mechanisms of and quantitative systems approach to human renal, digestive, endocrine, and metabolic physiology.<br/><br/>Required core course for BS in BME. Generally taken by juniors, but can be taken as early as sophomore year or as late as senior year. May be taken without BME 301 or BME 302, but BME 303 refers to material from those courses, and is more difficult if taken as the first course in the sequence.<br/><br/>BME 303 covers human renal, digestive, endocrine and metabolic physiology, at a relatively detailed systems level and with reference to diseases of these systems. Includes basic biochemistry of energy metabolism, and introductions to pharmacokinetics and immunology. The course is unified by a focus on metabolism, epithelial cell transport, and regulation. Evaluation is by several quantitative homework sets, use of clickers to answer questions in class, and three exams.", "name": "Systems Physiology", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "303-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 9:00AM - 9:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MEAS/BMD_ENG/303-0/32932", "instructor": ["Robert A Linsenmeier"], "id": "32932", "subject": "BMD_ENG"}]
