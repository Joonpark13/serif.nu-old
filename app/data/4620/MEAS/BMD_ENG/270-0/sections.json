[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "Overview<br/>The flow of fluids is important in many biomedical applications ranging from blood flow in the human body to drug delivery. BME 270 provides a general introduction to fluid mechanics, both statics and dynamics. The laboratory component of the class consists of take-home experiments using aquarium pumps.<br/><br/>Who takes it?<br/>BMD_ENG 270 is a required course for the BS in BME. Undergraduates take this course at the end of their second year or at the beginning of their third year. The course uses integral calculus and differential equations, so these courses are prerequisites. It also helps to have taken physics and thermodynamics prior to this course. An equivalent course, ME 241, may also be taken. <br/><br/>In spring 2016 students must arrange to be available to take a midterm exam starting at 4 pm on Friday, April 29th. Students are recommended to allow a minimum of three hours to complete the midterm exam. The final exam will also be held at 4 pm, with the day to be determined by the registrar's office.", "name": "Fluid Mechanics", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute L211", "topic": "", "course": "270-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 5:00PM - 6:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MEAS/BMD_ENG/270-0/32928", "instructor": ["Mitra J Hartmann"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "32928", "subject": "BMD_ENG"}]
