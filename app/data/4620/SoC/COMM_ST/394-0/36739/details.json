Materialism and obesity, mass murders and bullying, ADHD and aggressive behavior - What do these have in common? They are all social behaviors that, according to some, have been brought about or exacerbated by our new media environment. Such deviant behaviors give some people ample reason to fear digital and social media. But is technology to blame? We will grapple with this question as we use a historical perspective to investigate how our understanding of new media is socially shaped and, in turn, how new media might influence our social behavior. By examining empirical evidence, students will develop their own research-based argument about whether technology is good or evil, or somewhere in between."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:16 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
