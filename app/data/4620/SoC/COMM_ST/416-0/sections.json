[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "In this course we will investigate contemporary rhetorical analysis in two parallel ways. First, through assigned readings and class discussions, we will survey the theories and practices of rhetorical analysis in the discipline of communication from 1925 to the present, with an emphasis on current scholarship. We will read analytic works and discuss the perspectives that analysts take in studying their chosen subjects. Second, through independent research projects, students will undertake the practice of rhetorical analysis for themselves. Students who successfully complete this course should expect to be conversant in the disciplinary vocabularies of contemporary rhetorical analysis and should expect to have produced a critical work appropriate for conference or journal submission and/or for a thesis or dissertation chapter.", "name": "Contemporary Rhetorical Analysis", "section": "20", "location": "Frances Searle Building 2378", "topic": "", "course": "416-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SoC/COMM_ST/416-0/37743", "instructor": ["Angela   Ray"], "class_attributes": "Graduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "37743", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
