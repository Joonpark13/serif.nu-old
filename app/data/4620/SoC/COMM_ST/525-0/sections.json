What makes a city \"global?\" <br/> <br/>The course looks at both classic and contemporary studies of globalization, in order to understand how it is that capital, labor and knowledge travel from one context to another, and what happens when this occurs. The first part of the course focuses on key theoretical approaches (e.g., Braudel, Abu Lughod, Sassen, Appadurai, Burawoy, Tsing) in which the global appears as a diagnostic, a condition and a method. The second part of the course looks at historical and anthropological work on commodity chains as to better understand the relationships that are forged between multiple locales through the production, distribution and consumption of a particular product, be it bananas, timber, sushi or flip flops. The third part of the course elucidates how knowledge (about race, architecture, economics or medicine) is transformed when diffused. The final quarter of the course interrogates what happens with communication at a global scale, by looking at the work of call centers, advertising agencies and foreign correspondents. We conclude by looking at \"globalization from below\" and transnationalism as two revealing perspectives for looking at the movement of people, objects and labor. <br/> <br/>The course follows a mixed lecture/seminar format, combining formal presentations, short lectures, and group discussion. We will have a couple of guest scholars later in the semester, invited to discuss with us their work on globalization and culture.", "qtr": "Spring 2016", "name": "Seminar-Problems in Comm Studies", "title": "SoC COMM_ST 525-0-20 Seminar-Problems in Comm Studies", "lmod": "4/3/16 7:16 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Claudio Ezequiel Benzecry", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "Culture and Globalization", "course": "525-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students.<br/>Add Consent: Department Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "What happens when a factory closes in Illinois and relocates south of the Mexican border?
