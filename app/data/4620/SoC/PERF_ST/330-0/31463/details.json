In this class we explore how narratives of war have been staged and transmitted throughout history, as well as how war events themselves are constructed as performances. Beginning with Greek myths and classical theater, we explore how these heroic tales are continued, complicated, and critiqued in the contemporary era. Special attention will be given to how technology and media have changed the lived experience of warfare for combatants, victims, and spectators. Students will construct their own performances on the topic of war, broadly defined. No previous acting experience is required."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:22 PM (CT)", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
