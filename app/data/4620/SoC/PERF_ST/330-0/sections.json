[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "As long has there have been wars there have been stories about war. In this class we explore how narratives of war have been staged and transmitted throughout history, as well as how war events themselves are constructed as performances. Beginning with Greek myths and classical theater, we explore how these heroic tales are continued, complicated, and critiqued in the contemporary era. Special attention will be given to how technology and media have changed the lived experience of warfare for combatants, victims, and spectators. Students will construct their own performances on the topic of war, broadly defined. No previous acting experience is required.", "name": "Topics in Performance Studies", "section": "20", "location": "Annie May Swift Hall 103", "topic": "Performing War", "course": "330-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SoC/PERF_ST/330-0/31463", "instructor": ["Margaret Rosa Lebron"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31463", "subject": "PERF_ST"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course will examine the ways in which masculinity is represented in popular culture, theoretical discourse, and live performance. Assuming that gender is made and not given, the course will challenge the assumption that only \"men\" are creators, performers, and producers of masculinity.
