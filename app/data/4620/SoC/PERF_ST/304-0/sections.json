We will situate emergent popular music scenes as sites of encounter in the transnational cultural flow between MENA, Europe, and the Americas. We also address the intersection of aesthetics, politics, and religion by exploring how art is mobilized by Islamists for political purposes, and, how leisure and entertainment industries have shaped the emergence of an Islamic cultural sphere. We conclude by engaging with practices of cultural resistance that took place prior to and since the \"Arab Spring\" of 2011 in order to explore continuity and change in these cultural expressions and their means of circulation. Our materials include histories and ethnographies from across the region as well as recordings, film, video, radio, sound art, and digital media. Students will become familiar with the socio-cultural history of the modern Middle East and the formation of group identities based on class, gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, and religion. Students will also develop skills in sound production and be able to critically assess and interpret sound-based objects. Finally, students will deepen their cross-cultural awareness and understanding of sound, music, and media through projects that analyze modes of cultural production and synthesize their histories across the MENA region.", "qtr": "Spring 2016", "name": "Sonic Practices of the Middle East and North Africa", "title": "SoC PERF_ST 304-0-20 Sonic Practices of the Middle East and North Africa", "lmod": "4/3/16 7:22 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Shayna Mei Silverstein", "instructor_addr": "shayna.silverstein@northwestern.edu"}], "topic": "", "course": "304-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course examines sonic and musical practices in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in relation to modernity, transnationalism, political economy, and performance.We begin by surveying performance traditions including sung poetry, instrumental art music, circle folk dances, and religious rituals with attention to how these traditions embody modern ethnic, religious, and national identities across the MENA region.
