[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course offers an introduction to hip-hop culture and the multiple forms of performance it engenders. We will discuss hip-hop not only as a form of artistic expression, but also as a cultural practice historically (and presently) enacted in relationship to systems of oppression. Through the exploration of hip-hop studies scholarship, music and film, students will consider the political and socio-historical implications of hip-hop performance, attending to issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality. To this end, students will engage various aspects of this complex art form through written analyses, group presentations, community engagement and class discussion, in order to better understand hip-hop and its relationship to performance, culture and the social world.", "name": "Theories &amp; Methods in Performance", "section": "20", "topic": "Hip-Hop Performance &amp; Culture", "course": "216-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 4:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SoC/PERF_ST/216-0/31462", "instructor": ["Justin Gerald Zullo"], "id": "31462", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
