It is a technique class with barre and center work. This class will have an emphasis on technical development, extended movement combinations and phrases, including the integration of a broader vocabulary (than the one given on Ballet I), adding more concepts of dynamics, attack, musicality, alignment, lines, use of space and artistry. This course will be challenging to the students both physically and intellectually.<br/><br/>Students must have taken ballet I prior to this course, and/or have had previous Ballet training", "name": "Ballet II", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "270-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:00AM - 10:20AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SoC/DANCE/270-0/31019", "instructor": ["Vanessa   Valecillos"], "id": "31019", "subject": "DANCE"}]
