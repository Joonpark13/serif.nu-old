One argument connects the supernatural to spirituality and religion?that is, not a realm apart but intrinsic to our daily lives. We'll focus on low-or no-budget indy and foreign films with supernatural themes, as inspiration for your own micro-budget projects, also for you to develop your own theories about what the lures of this genre are for your audience. There will be weekly screenings (outside class), presentations, and readings in the genre. <br/><br/>The goal of the class is to shoot a final project (7-10 min) in which you explore some variety of the supernatural. You can work independently or in pairs. Students will have the option of writing an original shooting script or collaborating on your original story idea with screenwriting students. Though this process you'll refine your understanding of the supernatural genre, develop your directing skills, and end up with a solid rough cut (you can do more sound and post-production on down the road if you choose).<br/><br/>All students will be shooting final projects in this class.<br/><br/>Note: You must attend the first class to hold your place, and class attendance IS mandatory throughout the quarter."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:23 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
