How does it relate to other forms of art? How do viewers engage with it? And what role does it play in society? As cinema has mutated in conjunction with digital technologies, new media, and the forces of globalization, such questions have borne revisiting. This course examines key debates in both &quot;classical&quot; and &quot;contemporary&quot; film theory with an eye to such transformations, paying particular attention to the issues of medium specificity and spectatorship. We will also explore the contested role &quot;theory&quot; itself has played in cinema studies. Readings will include work by Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg, Jean Epstein, B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs, Siegfried Kracauer, Dziga Vertov, Sergei Eisenstein, Rudolf Arnheim, Andr\u00e9 Bazin, Christian Metz, Jean-Louis Baudry, Laura Mulvey, Mary Ann Doane, bell hooks, Tom Gunning, Miriam Hansen, David Bordwell, Vivian Sobchack, Francesco Casetti, and D.
