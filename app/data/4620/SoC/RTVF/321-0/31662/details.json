Initially imported to the United States by New York film critic Andrew Sarris, the theory took deep roots here. According to this theory, the film's author, as source and center of the film, is the director. Although other key production figures are important, the one person whose vision and personality dominates all stages of film is the director. Much debate ensued on this topic following its introduction into the US, a debate that was superseded for a time by the emerging structuralist and poststructuralist criticism that questioned authorship in favor of readership. However, there is now a resurgence of new thinking about film authorship and this class provides you with an opportunity to engage with this thinking by means of examining the works of two key American auteur directors, Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick, with widely divergent authorial styles, who have come to the fore since the 1960s. As a result, the 1960s forms the historical, sociopolitical, and cultural contexts for this discussion of authorship and cinema."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:23 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
