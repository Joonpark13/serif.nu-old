This period marks the aftermath of Hiroshima and the rise of television, space technologies, artificial intelligence, digital culture, and genetic engineering; in short, during this time there was a virtual explosion of scientific knowledge. Not coincidentally, science fiction became an extremely popular genre in film, pulp literature, and on television. These media texts used the new science for storytelling purposes, and in so doing transformed scientific change into speculation about social change and utopias. <br/> This &quot;speculative&quot; aspect of science fiction will be the key concern of the course as we look at how the genre imagines social relationships between sexes, races, classes?as well as silicon and human life forms. What kinds of narrative strategies do these texts use to represent new social orders and relations? What might these texts have meant in their original contexts and to their initial audiences? How has the genre changed over the last forty years, and in what ways can we make comparisons between generic changes and social changes? How has science fiction lent itself to self-reflexive exploration of cinema itself?especially cinematic time and cinematic space? And how does the genre relate to the way space and place is itself constructed in the physical, everyday, virtual environment of cyberspace? How are posthumanism -telerobotics- and cyborg subjectivity integral to the new examples of the genre? How does Science Fiction operate in and on the Anthropocene? These questions form the focus of the various topics in the course. Evaluations based on final seminar paper, reading reports, oral presentations."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:24 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
