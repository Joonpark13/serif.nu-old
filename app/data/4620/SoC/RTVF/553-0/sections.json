[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course is a workshop that will explore the intersection between new media production and documentary practice. The course will approach interactive documentary as an emerging field. Students will study the history and theory of interactive documentary while actively contributing to field as it develops. The course will focus on unique aesthetics and affordances of documentary narratives when expressed through hypertext, interactive video, video gaming, as well as other hybrid genres. Students will develop their own interactive documentary projects with special attention to web publication. Students will be evaluated through active participation, individual exercises, reading responses, presentations, and projects in group critique. The course is designed for students with no prior experience working with digital tools, but who are prepared to engage their own documentary practice with new media techniques at a graduate level.", "name": "Interactive Techniques/Emerging Forms", "section": "20", "location": "Louis Hall 118", "topic": "", "course": "553-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 3:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SoC/RTVF/553-0/31750", "instructor": ["Charles Stephen Evans"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31750", "subject": "RTVF"}]
