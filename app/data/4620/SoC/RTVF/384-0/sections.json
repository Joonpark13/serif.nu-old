[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Building on the basic concepts presented in RTVF383, Advanced Audio Production focuses on the relationship of sound to moving image, and introduces recording and post-production techniques/strategies that address this relationship as a compositional imperative. The primary focus is on the assembly, manipulation, and mix of audio in relationship to moving image, and the clear intentionality of designing sound for moving image. Through demonstrations, in-class workshops, readings, lectures and screenings, students will learn how to work effectively and creatively in any studio or location sound environment.?", "name": "Advanced Audio Production", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "384-0", "meeting_time": ["We 12:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SoC/RTVF/384-0/31676", "instructor": ["Alexander Michael Inglizian"], "id": "31676", "subject": "RTVF"}]
