[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Over the course of the past few decades, digital technologies have come to play an increasingly large role in the creation and experience of movies. In the 1990s, digital visual effects, digital sound, digital nonlinear editing, and digital cinematography all came into widespread use. Since that time, we have also witnessed a boom in digital means of distributing and exhibiting &quot;films,&quot; from DVD to digital projection and streaming. As hard drives have replaced celluloid, handheld devices have competed with movie theaters, and the lines between cinema and television have become blurred, many critics and scholars have wondered what is left of movies as we once knew them. The course explores this tumultuous period of technological change, looking at a wide range of movies that use, anticipate, and comment on digital technologies. Throughout, we will also examine the questions these movies raise about the nature of cinema and its metamorphoses.", "name": "Technological Innovations", "section": "20", "topic": "Digital Cinema", "course": "341-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 3:00PM - 4:50PM", "Th 3:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SoC/RTVF/341-0/31663", "instructor": ["Ariel Rebecca Rogers"], "id": "31663", "subject": "RTVF"}]
