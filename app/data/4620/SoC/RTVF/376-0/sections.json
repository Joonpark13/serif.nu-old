[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course is an introduction to web-based media through the practical use of web code, video, image editing, and animation. The course will explore different expressive media such as software, moving image, and performance, as well as show how these strategies can work in concert with each other online. Students will have the opportunity to conceptualize their own projects and select from a menu of approaches in order to execute them. Projects can include works created for the screen, the web, participation with web media at a specific site, or an event-based web work in public. Students will be evaluated through active participation, individual exercises, reading responses, presentations, and unit projects in group critique. The course is designed for students with no prior experience creating web media, although students with experience are welcome to enroll.", "name": "Topics in Interactive Media", "section": "20", "location": "Louis Hall 118", "topic": "Web Convergence", "course": "376-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 1:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SoC/RTVF/376-0/31725", "instructor": ["Charles Stephen Evans"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "31725", "subject": "RTVF"}]
