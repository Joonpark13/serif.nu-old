[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course is for graduate students who will conduct qualitative research on the behavioral and social aspects of technology use and technology design. The objective of this course is to give students practical, hands-on experience with interviewing, observation, and qualitative analysis techniques. The course is run as a seminar, and students will be responsible for leading discussion on weekly readings. Assignments throughout the term will allow students to apply the methods discussed in class. Students are encouraged collect and analyze data related to their own research as part of the course. In addition to mini-assignments, students will submit a final course project in which they are expected to apply the methods learned about in the course.", "name": "Special Topics Research Seminar", "section": "26", "location": "Frances Searle Building 2378", "topic": "Qual Methods for Tech Design", "course": "525-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 3:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SoC/MTS/525-0/34795", "instructor": ["Anne Marie   Piper"], "class_attributes": "Graduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "34795", "subject": "MTS"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Online identity has historically been considered by the literature as distinct from face-to-face identity, in part because we tended historically to think about the Internet and online spaces as distinct from \"real world\" spaces. This is complicated by new technologies that allow us to interact with real people nearby and that allow us to share information about our real-world location. This means we need to reconsider how we think about both identity and location, but theories haven't always kept pace. The goal of this seminar is to explore a range of literatures on identity, anonymity and the design of both online and offline social spaces.", "name": "Special Topics Research Seminar", "section": "27", "location": "Annenberg Hall G28", "topic": "Space, Place and Identity", "course": "525-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SoC/MTS/525-0/34796", "instructor": ["Jeremy P Birnholtz"], "class_attributes": "Graduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "34796", "subject": "MTS"}]
