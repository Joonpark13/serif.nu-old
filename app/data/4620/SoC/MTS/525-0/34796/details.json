This is complicated by new technologies that allow us to interact with real people nearby and that allow us to share information about our real-world location. This means we need to reconsider how we think about both identity and location, but theories haven't always kept pace. The goal of this seminar is to explore a range of literatures on identity, anonymity and the design of both online and offline social spaces."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Goffman, E.
