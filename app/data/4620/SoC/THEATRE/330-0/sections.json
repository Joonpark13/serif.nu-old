Using the gravity-directed, injury-preventive alignment concept of Standing Down Straight\u00ae (SDS), partners work with each other on physically letting go of some of the &quot;holding patterns&quot; of tension in their body that can, unconsciously, accumulate in both the body's muscles and in the mind. Why let go of these excess tensions? It's the proposal of this class that they can oftentimes get in the way of creating mutually beneficial, non-judgmental collaborations with another person or persons, whether in this class, in a rehearsal, in a lab-partnership, or in everyday life. <br/> <br/>In addition to working at using SDS to gradually replace these holding patterns, partners also focus on working at becoming more adept at sensing when to initiate actions and when to yield. In dance-partnering terms, this form of give-and-take is referred to as sensing when to &quot;lead&quot; and when to &quot;follow.&quot; Such mutuality of leading and following, such equality of giving and receiving with another - as experienced through the hands, eyes and rhythm-singing voice in this class, as mentioned above - forms the foundation of the kind of weight-shared, rhythm-shared dancing we do with our dance partners here. The hope is that, in the future, it can also serve as a foundation for collaborative decision-making as practiced in rehearsals in the performing arts, partnerships in the sciences and other professions, and in everyday relationships."}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SoC/THEATRE/330-0/37870", "instructor": ["William Lewis   Siegenfeld", "Joseph J Holtgreive"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37870", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
