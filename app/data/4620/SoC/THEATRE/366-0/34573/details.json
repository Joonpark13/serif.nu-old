To get their work seen, such playwrights had to distance themselves from the social orders they knew best, and their work often shows an ambivalence toward the worlds of greater economic opportunity and individual expressiveness that they found in the north. We will examine this ambivalence toward the full-blown modernity of places like Chicago and New York in the writing of such key twentieth century and contemporary playwrights as Amiri Baraka, Alice Childress, Horton Foote, Lorraine Hansberry, Nathan Louis Jackson, Tennessee Williams, and Derek Walcott. As we read works by such writers, we will also examine theoretical texts that will help us understand the uneven nature of capitalistic development, and how such economic and social patterns affect the way that theatre artists approach their work. <br/> <br/>Students will have homework assignments, reading quizzes, two 3-4 page essays, and one 10-12 page essay."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:26 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
