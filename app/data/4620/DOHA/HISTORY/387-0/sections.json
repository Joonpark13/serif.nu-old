[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "<p>In last fifty years of the 20th Century the rivalry between the USA and the USSR brought the world to the brink of nuclear destruction. This course explores the Cold War as a military, political, ideological, and economic contest for global domination. We will examine how the Cold War started in the last days of WW2, spread around the world in a series of proxy wars before ending suddenly in 1991 with the breakup of the Soviet Union. Our primary focus will be on the American experience abroad and at home. Special attention will be given to the different ways popular forms of media responded to and, in turn, influenced the major themes of the Cold War.</p>", "name": "History Adv Special Topics:", "section": "70", "location": "Carnegie Mellon Room 3046", "topic": "The Cold War, 1945 - 1991", "course": "387-0", "meeting_time": ["TuSu 03:00PM - 04:20PM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/DOHA/HISTORY/387-0/30570", "instructor": ["Christopher James Macintosh Sparshott"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "30570", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
