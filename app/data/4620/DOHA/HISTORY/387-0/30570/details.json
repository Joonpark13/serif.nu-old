This course explores the Cold War as a military, political, ideological, and economic contest for global domination. We will examine how the Cold War started in the last days of WW2, spread around the world in a series of proxy wars before ending suddenly in 1991 with the breakup of the Soviet Union. Our primary focus will be on the American experience abroad and at home. Special attention will be given to the different ways popular forms of media responded to and, in turn, influenced the major themes of the Cold War.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to sophomores and above</li><br/><li>Open for Cross-Registration</li><br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:14 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
