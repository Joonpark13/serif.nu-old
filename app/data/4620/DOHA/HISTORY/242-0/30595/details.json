It is designed to be an analysis of the forces that shaped and reshaped American society from 1900 to the present day. In what has become known as America's Century, the United States rose to superpower status abroad and at home began reexamining what it meant to be American. We will focus on how generations of ordinary Americans experienced and responded to this fast paced century. Topics covered in the course include American imperialism, Progressivism, World War I, the Roaring Twenties, the Great Depression, World War II, the Postwar Boom, the Cold War, the Civil Rights Movements, Vietnam War, New Conservatism and Globalism. Special attention will be given to the different ways popular forms of media responded to and, in turn, influenced the major themes of the day.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Open to freshmen and above</li><br/><li>Open for cross-registration</li><br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:14 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
