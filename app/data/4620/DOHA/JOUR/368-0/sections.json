The course combines theory of documentary production, research/pre-production and practical production/post-production elements. Hand-on demonstrations, screenings, readings, lectures and discussion prepare students to produce their own documentary. Students will be required to complete the production elements during class time, both part of a group, as well as autonomously. Classes place a strong emphasis on research, planning and writing skills as these are deemed essential for successful video production.</p>", "name": "Documentary", "section": "70", "topic": "", "course": "368-0", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeSu 01:30PM - 04:20PM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/DOHA/JOUR/368-0/30556", "instructor": ["Miriam   Berg"], "id": "30556", "subject": "JOUR"}]
