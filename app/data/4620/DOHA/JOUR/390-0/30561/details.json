Early in the course you will build knowledge of the structure, evolution and philosophy of the Internet to help understand how and why it continues to be such a force for journalism. From there you will delve into the key areas for opportunity and change that this has created for journalism, paying particular attention to: Transformations in the way news and information is distributed digitally, including present-day channels like social media, mobile and wearable technology and potential future channels like virtual reality and mobile holography; The evolving relationship between news organizations and their audiences, including emerging research about the behavior of online audiences and how news organizations endeavor to better understand those audiences to engage them; Ongoing innovations in the production of journalistic content: new methods of news- and information-gathering using sophisticated digital tools like robots, sensors and drones; and innovative methods for digital storytelling. The course will be rooted in the practical experiences of digital journalists and digital news organizations and will feature guest lectures and case studies of future-oriented digital news organizations like VICE, Reportedly and BuzzFeed.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Juniors and above JOUR majors only; for students going on residency.</li> <br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:14 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
