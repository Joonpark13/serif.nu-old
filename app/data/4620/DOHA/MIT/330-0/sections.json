[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "This course is designed to provide a creative arena where students can work together in a collaborative process to develop and produce an ensemble project for the stage. Participating in class as playmakers and/or performers, all students will engage in creative research and activities. The course will also consist of required reading, creative writing exercises, character and scene improvisations, and rehearsal process. (The rehearsal process will require additional evening and/or weekend meeting time outside of class during the final 3 weeks.) The course will conclude with a public performance of the play. Actual performance participation in the final production is not required, however all students will be actively involved in and responsible for a specific aspect of production. Although there is no prerequisite for this course, it is highly advisable that students have previously taken one of the performance courses, THEATRE143 Basic Acting or MIT 298 Principles of Characterization. <br/><br/>l students, however, must submit a one-page (maximum) statement prior to registration addressing the questions below.
