[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "<p>As a class, students will write, shoot, and edit six three-minute episodes (one &quot;season&quot;) of a comedic web series. Through a Hollywood-style pitch competition, the class will select the narrative theme of the series. After determining the narrative theme, several weeks of writer's rooms will take place, which include scripting episodes, acting rehearsals, and pre-production. These preparations will culminate with one month to shoot, edit, and color correct the series. The final product will be uploaded to YouTube and marketed through a social media campaign on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.</p>", "name": "Topics in Film/Video/Audio Production", "section": "70", "topic": "Creating the Comedic Web Series", "course": "379-0", "meeting_time": ["Su 10:00AM - 11:50AM (AST)", "Tu 09:00AM - 11:50AM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/DOHA/MIT/379-0/30527", "instructor": ["Anne Louise Sobel"], "id": "30527", "subject": "MIT"}]
