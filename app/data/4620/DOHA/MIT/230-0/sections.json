Surveying foundational scholarship in television and new media theory, the class examines a range of critical approaches, including aesthetic/formal analysis, narrative criticism, ideological analysis, political economy, cultural criticism, and audience reception. Working to advance their analytical skills, students will practice using these approaches to examine issues of style, form, ideology, and identity (e.g., race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, nationality, and generation) in a range of historical and contemporary television shows, commercials, and online videos. American television will be taken up as our primary object of study, but students will also explore TV shows from the MENA region in a group assignment. Ultimately, the goals of the course are: 1) to acquaint students with a range of critical and methodological tools for analyzing the production, reception, and cultural meanings of television; and 2) to strengthen and expand students' understanding of diverse TV content, contexts, and convergences at different times in history.</p>", "qtr": "Spring 2016", "name": "Understanding Media Contexts", "title": "DOHA MIT 230-0-70 Understanding Media Contexts", "lmod": "4/3/16 7:15 PM (CT)", "section": "70", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Kirsten Marie Pike", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "230-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Registration is reserved for sophomore, juniors, and seniors only.", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "<p>This course introduces students to ways of analyzing the social, cultural, economic, and political contexts in which people produce and consume media, especially television.
