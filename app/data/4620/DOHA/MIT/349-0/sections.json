[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "<p>This course provides academic structure and guidance for professional internships being completed by students in the Communication Program. The course covers organizational communication and behavior topics, including: organizational cultures; working in teams; managing generational differences; effective workplace strategies; leadership and mentoring; work-life balance; ethics and soft skills; feedback and motivation; technology in the workplace; networking; and starting life as young professional. In this seminar-style class, we discuss the readings and their relationship to events in the job sites; students share their progress reports, questions, and concerns about the work they are completing in various media-related jobs. Students are encouraged to explore the links and gaps between what they have learned in the classroom and what they are learning in the workplace, thereby developing their professional skills while deepening their academic experiences. Students are evaluated on a written final project and presentation and by their work site supervisor, as well as their weekly written responses to the readings, which should show a clear understanding of the readings as well as thoughtful application to the work site.</p>", "name": "Internship", "section": "70", "location": "CMUQ3203", "topic": "", "course": "349-0", "meeting_time": ["We 04:00PM - 06:00PM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/DOHA/MIT/349-0/30540", "instructor": ["Susan   Dun"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "30540", "subject": "MIT"}]
