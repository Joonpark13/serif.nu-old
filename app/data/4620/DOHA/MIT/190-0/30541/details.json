Building upon the aesthetic and narrative concepts introduced in MIT 220, this class will introduce the challenges and opportunities created by shooting and editing sync-sound material in both fiction and non-fiction forms. Basic camera, lighting, audio, and non-linear editing labs will be combined with regular discussions and lectures. Projects will include an audio assignment, a photography assignment, and a short film. Students will use DSLR still photography cameras, Canon C100 video cameras, location audio recording equipment, and Adobe Creative Suite to envision and execute their productions.</p>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Prerequisites: None</li><br/><li>Freshmen only, MIT majors only</li><br/></ul>"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:15 PM (CT)", "subject": "MIT"}]
