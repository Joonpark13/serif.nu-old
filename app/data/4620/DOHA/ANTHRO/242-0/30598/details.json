Anthropologists studying law are concerned with the way law is made, and how it circulates, is embodied, and, essentially, lived. Thus, in this course, students will be asked to consider the politics of law and how this impacts people's lives. We will look at the ways in which institutions of the state shape society through practices of lawmaking, but also how society shapes the state through its daily responses to institutional processes. The course will deal with the following questions: how do people live democratic practices like voting and elections? How are people impacted by discourses of security? How is human rights law mobilized for and against people? How is the citizen and subject constructed through the law? The course will deal with such concepts as citizenship, sovereignty, human rights, colonialism, legal recognition and more. Students will gain an in-depth picture of law in culture and society by studying different parts of the world. They will also be asked to conduct a short ethnographic project that looks at how people live in and through institutions."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites: None<br/>Open to juniors and above<br/>Open for Cross-Registration"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:14 PM (CT)", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
