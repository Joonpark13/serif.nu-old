The course explores many of the issues that arise in building such models, e.g., exploratory vs. confirmatory studies, inductive vs. deductive reasoning, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, nonlinearity, interactions, model selection, regularization, bias-variance tradeoff, extrapolation, and the curse of dimensionality. You will learn how some linear and nonparametric methods address these issues. Students will understand how and why different methods work, which methods are well-suited for certain situations, and the extent of the conclusions that can be drawn from various models. Students will learn multiple statistical software packages, including R, SAS, SPSS, and the IBM miner. There will be two projects this quarter, and students will work with students from the University of Amsterdam on one of the two."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:11 PM (CT)", "subject": "IMC"}]
