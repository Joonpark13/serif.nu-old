The master has failed more times than the novice has even tried. Creating Outstanding Digital Experiences is a pragmatic introduction to creating code for digital content. Today's digital culture is being created directly by its consumers. Empowered by easy, elegant, and effective open web technologies, it has never been more possible to personally transform ideas into objects and strategies into software. The course is designed for complete beginners, with little or no programming experience. A hands-on learning lab approach demystifies the jargon and simplifies the complexity of HTML5, CSS3, and a sprinkling of Javascript. Students will discover for themselves that &quot;making is thinking&quot; as they explore the art and science of crafting delightful and useful digital content."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:11 PM (CT)", "subject": "IMC"}]
