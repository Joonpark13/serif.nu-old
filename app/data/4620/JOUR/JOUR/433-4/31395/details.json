Emphasis is put on the use of character, conflict, drama, and surprise in telling these documentary stories. We will also look at different documentary styles and how narrative structures like story arcs are implemented. Students will learn documentary production with a journalism focus: reporting, camera technique, lighting, and sound recording in the field. Students will create a seven-ten minute documentary project in a group of 2. They will research and write a treatment, cast charismatic characters, get signed releases, shoot, and edit the film.
