Class blends background material from the behavioral sciences with techniques used in practice and focuses in three general areas: (1) the logic, implementation and analysis of primary research; (2) the ability to evaluate the quality, usefulness and appropriateness of research and results from other sources, and (3) the applicability of research to the practice of journalism. The virtuous relationship between community and news media use is well established in the literature and commonly accepted in the journalism business.
