Students can delve deeper into a beat they covered or establish a new beat. Weekly three-hour seminars focus on strategies for enterprise reporting, high-impact storytelling, data visualization, and investigative techniques that apply to all areas of specialized reporting. Students schedule another full day every week to report and produce two immersive stories in any medium during the first half of the quarter, working closely with the instructor to develop and refine the stories. These are pitched to Medill's Huffington Post blog site and posted on Medill Reports. During the second half of the quarter, the class collaborates to develop a dynamic reporting project involving all of our specializations. Everyone will produce at least one story for a website to present this project."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:13 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
