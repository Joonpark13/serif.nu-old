The struggle between Israelis and Palestinians and its relations with neighboring Arab states is a staple of worldwide media coverage and one of the most challenging areas for journalists. This class explores the opposing narratives of the current conflict over the West Bank and Gaza and the entire land's extraordinary history, one that is filled with both politics and passion, dreams and dislocation. At the western end of the so-called Fertile Crescent, Israel/Palestine is a multi-cultural arena and the class will examine how the contested capital, Jerusalem, is core for three great monotheistic religions. Students will learn the cultural nuances that exist among Jews, Muslims and Christians and be introduced to great archaeological finds and the role Tel Aviv's high-tech start-ups play in fueling the &quot;Start-Up<br/>Nation&quot;."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:12 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
