Across the globe, millions of people are on the move, straining the capacity of governments and international relief organizations to cope and ordinary citizens to comprehend. In the United States, France, Germany and much of Europe, the recent flow of humanity from the Middle East, in particular, has become a prominent social and political issue, prompting profound questions about how to respond. This class explores the origins of the current refugee crisis and its ongoing evolution, paying attention to disparate voices and interests. You will polish skills in research/reporting, interviewing and critical thinking as you work toward meaningful final projects in an array of media. Open to graduates and undergraduates, the class is a prerequisite for BSJ students chosen to travel to France or MSJ students chosen to travel to Germany in June 2016."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:12 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
