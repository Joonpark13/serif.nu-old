Through classroom and real-world experience, you will explore the power, limits and moral complexities of investigative reporting and encounter its struggles and triumphs firsthand. The class, co-taught by a Chicago Tribune reporter, will directly pursue a real-world journalism project. You should expect to spend significant time during and outside class hours conducting research and fieldwork and producing status reports. This course will help you analyze urgent, relevant and diverse issues; hone critical thinking, reporting and writing skills; and enrich your understanding of the communities and concerns that surround us."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:12 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
