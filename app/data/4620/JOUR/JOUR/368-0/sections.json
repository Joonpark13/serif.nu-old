[{"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "This course will provide students with a comprehensive overview of HD video production, specifically geared towards producing short documentaries that tell human stories. Emphasis is put on the use of character, conflict, drama, and surprise in telling these documentary stories. We will also look at different documentary styles and how narrative structures like story arcs are implemented. Students will learn documentary production with a journalism focus: reporting, camera technique, lighting, and sound recording in the field. Students will create a seven-ten minute documentary project in a group of three. They will research and write a proposal, cast charismatic characters, get signed releases, shoot, and edit the film. All group members will have equal roles in this process. Post production editing on a Mac using Premiere, sound mixing in Premiere, and exporting will also be introduced. Student documentaries have won awards at major film festivals and have been nominated for College Emmys. Students will leave this class with a long-form documentary for their demo reel.", "name": "Documentary", "section": "20", "location": "McCormick Foundation Ctr 2111", "topic": "Video", "course": "368-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 9:00AM - 11:50AM", "Fr 9:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/JOUR/JOUR/368-0/31353", "instructor": ["Brent E Huffman"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "31353", "subject": "JOUR"}]
