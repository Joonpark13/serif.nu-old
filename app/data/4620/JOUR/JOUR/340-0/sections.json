[{"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "Sponsored by the Medill-McCormick Center for Innovation in Technology, Media and Journalism. In this one-unit course, cross-functional teams of journalism and computer science students collaborate in the creation of working tools aimed at the generation, presentation and deployment of news and information. The emphasis is on building tools to assist journalists in the performance of their daily tasks, e.g. in conjunction with a large-scale database system, or in the development of a Web-based application. The objective is to develop a set of skills that will allow students to do problem-solving in information access and management, and to share responsibility with team members in the framing, architecture, management, and implementation of technology-based projects.", "name": "Innovation and News in Technology", "section": "1", "location": "Garage Workspace Classroom 1", "topic": "", "course": "340-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:00PM - 9:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/JOUR/JOUR/340-0/38254", "instructor": ["Lawrence A Birnbaum", "Zach   Wise"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "38254", "subject": "JOUR"}]
