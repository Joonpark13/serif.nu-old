[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "Opera is a collaborative art, made up of many constituent parts. In this course, students will gain familiarity with opera by dissecting it into its various elements - music, text, narrative, stagecraft, among others - and studying each in depth. Through studying opera from its beginnings in the 17th century to the present day, we will also develop a contextual understanding of opera's cultural role. Students will be expected to actively participate in daily discussions, to develop a final research project, and to attend an opera performance.", "name": "History of Opera", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "230-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MUSIC/GEN_MUS/230-0/37763", "instructor": ["Jenna Marie Harmon"], "id": "37763", "subject": "GEN_MUS"}]
