In this course, students will gain familiarity with opera by dissecting it into its various elements - music, text, narrative, stagecraft, among others - and studying each in depth. Through studying opera from its beginnings in the 17th century to the present day, we will also develop a contextual understanding of opera's cultural role. Students will be expected to actively participate in daily discussions, to develop a final research project, and to attend an opera performance."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 6:32 PM (CT)", "subject": "GEN_MUS"}]
