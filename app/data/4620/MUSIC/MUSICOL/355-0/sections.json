[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "When opera entered the 20th century, it had to face the legacy of Verdi and Wagner, the increasing consolidation of a performing repertoire, the new currents of modernism, and the rise of cinema and other mass media entertainments, among other challenges. This course will examine how opera composers (and singers, directors, and audiences) have grappled with the genre - and the question of its continued cultural relevance - from 1900 to the present. Operas to be studied may include works by Debussy, Puccini, Strauss, Jan\u00e1?ek, Weill, Berg, Gershwin, Britten, Stravinsky, Messiaen, Adams, and others. Beyond repertoire, we will consider shifts in how opera has been staged, sung, marketed, and mediated. We will also be able to experience the School of Music's production of Carlisle Floyd's Susannah, and a &quot;Live in HD&quot; transmission from the Metropolitan Opera.", "name": "Topics in 20th Century Music", "section": "20", "topic": "Opera Since 1900", "course": "355-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MUSIC/MUSICOL/355-0/35840", "instructor": ["Scott Douglas Paulin"], "id": "35840", "subject": "MUSICOL"}]
