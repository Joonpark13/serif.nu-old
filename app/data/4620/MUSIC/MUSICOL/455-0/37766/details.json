This course will examine how opera composers (and singers, directors, and audiences) have grappled with the genre - and the question of its continued cultural relevance - from 1900 to the present. Operas to be studied may include works by Debussy, Puccini, Strauss, Jan\u00e1?ek, Weill, Berg, Gershwin, Britten, Stravinsky, Messiaen, Adams, and others. Beyond repertoire, we will consider shifts in how opera has been staged, sung, marketed, and mediated. We will also be able to experience the School of Music's production of Carlisle Floyd's Susannah, and a &quot;Live in HD&quot; transmission from the Metropolitan Opera."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 6:35 PM (CT)", "subject": "MUSICOL"}]
