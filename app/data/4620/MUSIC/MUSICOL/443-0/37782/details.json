Textual languages include not only The Bard's original English and its more modern forms, but also French, Italian, Russian, and other modern languages. Given the character and complexity of the material, and the multimedia and interdisciplinary natures of Shakespeare-inspired musical works and scholarship, this course is open to students whose primary interest or field of study is comparative literature, film, English, performance studies, or theatre, as well as any area of music. Because the original productions of all of Shakespeare's plays included music, and each one has inspired many musical interpretations since that time, we will concentrate on multiple iterations of three plays."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Junior, senior, or graduate standing."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 6:35 PM (CT)", "subject": "MUSICOL"}]
