Curriculum as a field of study often draws upon closely related foundational disciplines of history, philosophy, psychology, sociology and educational policy studies to examine what is taught and learned in music classrooms. We will draw upon these disciplines to understand contemporary curriculum theory and practice, particularly in the current climate of school reform and changes proposed for music education specifically. Students will analyze and critique available curricular models, and design comprehensive programs to foster students musical growth."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 6:36 PM (CT)", "subject": "MUSIC_ED"}]
