[{"school": "TGS", "overview_of_class": "This is a literature-based course designed to give students a framework to understand the current state of our knowledge about the cellular to system basis for information processing and storage. Weekly classes will be facilitated by faculty experts in specific areas of neural plasticity and information storage. Students will read papers assigned by the lecturer before each class and submit two relevant questions to for each paper (to then be discussed in class). Thus, seminal papers on each topic will be considered in class, whilst an overview of the important questions will be provided by the faculty facilitator. In each lecture consideration will be given how the information reviewed can be translated to problems related to issues of mental health.", "name": "Cellular &amp; Molecular Basis of Information Storage", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "470-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 9:00AM - 12:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/TGS/NUIN/470-0/38244", "instructor": ["Anis   Contractor"], "id": "38244", "subject": "NUIN"}]
