Students will examine the unique characteristics of middle school learning and the educational needs of young adolescent learners, and they will compare and contrast a variety of middle school models, including<br/>policy statements, visions and reform proposals. Students will share and consider their personal experiences, and those of the entire class, as they investigate the many and varied issues that impact any middle school and its community.<br/><br/>Major topics include public policy issues, adolescent development, standards and<br/>curriculum, measures of intelligence, learning differences, school structure and culture, instructional relationships and strategies, literacy and reading in the content areas, the development of critical thinking skills, culturally responsive and equitable practices, interdisciplinary instruction, assessment methods, middle school leadership, and technology. Given the important transitions and cognitive milestones that occur during the middle school years, we will consider efforts to strike a balance between rigorous curriculum standards and developmentally<br/>appropriate modes of learning. We will consider the views and proposals of many of the parties with an interest in middle grades reform, and students will be given an opportunity to research and share their knowledge of particular subjects."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:27 PM (CT)", "subject": "MS_ED"}]
