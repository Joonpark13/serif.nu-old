Students will identify a<br/>practical problem or issue of interest to them concerning the education of gifted children<br/>in their local school setting or community, investigate it, and attempt to address and find<br/>solutions to it, resulting in an authentic product or outcome to offer stakeholders. The<br/>project will allow students to experience first hand the issues involved in school practice<br/>with gifted students.", "name": "The Gifted: Capstone II", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "444-2", "meeting_time": ["TBA"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SESP/MS_ED/444-2/36950", "instructor": ["Susan Richert Corwith"], "id": "36950", "subject": "MS_ED"}]
