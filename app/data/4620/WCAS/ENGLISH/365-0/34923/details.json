Should we use western terms (e.g., &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;lesbian&quot;) to describe sexual practices in the global south? What are the main theoretical issues in postcolonial studies, and how would the positions change if we factored in gender and sexuality? How are sex relations used as an allegory of the national condition? What are the attitudes toward inter-species sex among postcolonial writers? Authors to be discussed include Jessica Hagedorn, Witi Ihimaera, H. Nigel Thomas, Chris Abani, K. Sello Duiker, Suniti Namjoshi, and Lawrence Scott. We will consider postcolonial theoretical statements by a wide range of scholars (e.g., Gayatri Spivak, Chandra Talpade Mohanty, Gayatri Gopinath, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Chinua Achebe etc.)"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Interactive lectures, debates, role play, one-on-one meetings, and small group discussions."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Two 6-page papers, weekly Canvas postings, regular self-evaluation, peer critiques, class participation, take-home exam, pop quizzes (ungraded), and 1-minute papers (ungraded)."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Cliff, Michelle, No Telephone to Heaven, New York: E.P.
