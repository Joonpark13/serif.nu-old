[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The course responds to shifts in paradigms of gender and sexuality in writing from the global south and in western writing about formerly colonized subjects. Should we use western terms (e.g., \"gay\" and \"lesbian\") to describe sexual practices in the global south? What are the main theoretical issues in postcolonial studies, and how would the positions change if we factored in gender and sexuality? How are sex relations used as an allegory of the national condition? What are the attitudes toward inter-species sex among postcolonial writers? Authors to be discussed include Jessica Hagedorn, Witi Ihimaera, H. Nigel Thomas, Chris Abani, K. Sello Duiker, Suniti Namjoshi, and Lawrence Scott. We will consider postcolonial theoretical statements by a wide range of scholars (e.g., Gayatri Spivak, Chandra Talpade Mohanty, Gayatri Gopinath, Kwame Anthony Appiah, Chinua Achebe etc.)", "name": "Studies in Postcolonial Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Parkes Hall 223", "topic": "Postcolonial Sexualities", "course": "365-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ENGLISH/365-0/34923", "instructor": ["Evan M Mwangi"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34923", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
