[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "John Milton composed extraordinary poetry in every major mode of Renaissance verse - lyric, dramatic, and epic. In this course, we will study in detail many of these poetic works, focusing especially on Milton's inspired and breathtaking epic, Paradise Lost. We will frame our readings by considering the shape of Milton's authorial career and his often radical views on politics, theology, and poetics. Milton's poetry invites us to explore questions regarding free will, justice, good and evil, revolution, and desire.", "name": "Milton", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "335-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ENGLISH/335-0/34917", "instructor": ["Whitney Blair Taylor"], "id": "34917", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
