[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is a survey of American literature from the decade preceding the Civil War to 1900. In lectures and discussion sections, we shall explore the divergent textual voices - white and black, male and female, poor and rich, slave and free - that constitute the literary tradition of the United States in the nineteenth century. Central to our study will be the following questions: What does it mean to be an American in 1850, 1860, 1865, and beyond? Who speaks for the nation? How do the tragedy and the triumph of the Civil War inflect American poetry and narrative? And how do post-bellum writers represent the complexities of democracy, particularly the gains and losses of Reconstruction, the advent of and resistance to the &quot;New Woman,&quot; and the class struggle in the newly reunited nation?", "name": "American Literary Traditions", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "270-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ENGLISH/270-2/34893", "instructor": ["Julia Ann   Stern", "Jay A Grossman"], "id": "34893", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
