His fiction and nonfiction attempted to understand phenomena as varied as athletic achievement, drug addiction, pornography, religion, and how new technologies were changing human relationships. This course will survey Wallace's work in several different genres, including essays (Consider the Lobster), short stories (Oblivion), and the novel (Infinite Jest). How does Wallace's work respond to and revise the influence of such postmodern writers as Thomas Pynchon, Donald Barthelme, and Don Delillo? What were the historical conditions that made Wallace's work resonate with such a wide readership? What will be Wallace's literary legacy?"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "A mix of lecture and discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Quizzes, short essays, final project."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Post 1830"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:59 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
