Here's how you get Capone. He pulls a knife, you pull a gun. He puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one of his in the morgue. That's the Chicago way.&quot; In this class, we will examine &quot;the Chicago way&quot; from many different angles in order to interrogate the values with which various artists have endowed Chicago. We will read in a broad range of media: journalism, poetry, song, fiction, film, and sequential art to see how a sense of Chicago as a place works over time. We will pay close attention to depictions of the construction of American identity, and to the role of the artist and intellectual in the city."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion, brief lectures, guest speakers, and an optional urban tour."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation; brief written responses to each text; several options for papers of various lengths."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Nelson Algren's Chicago: City on the Make and The Neon Wilderness;<br/>Richard Wright's Native Son;<br/>Stuart Dybek's The Coast of Chicago;<br/>journalism by Ben Hecht, Mike Royko and others;<br/>short fiction by Sandra Cisneros, James T.
