[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Women and violence is growing topic of interest in our media culture, with entire channels like ID Discovery devoted to marketing true-crime dramas to a mostly female viewership. In this course we examine cultural perceptions about women and violence, both as victims and perpetrators. We look at historical precedents for female crime in American and British culture and study how our perceptions of female violence and agency have evolved over time. The primary focus is on television, film and news media. Students are expected to write and present on weekly topics and complete all reading and viewing assignments.", "name": "Studies in Literature and Film", "section": "20", "location": "Parkes Hall 223", "topic": "Criminal Minds", "course": "386-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ENGLISH/386-0/37734", "instructor": ["Sarah   Valentine"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "37734", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
