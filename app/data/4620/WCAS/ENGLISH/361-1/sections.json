[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "&quot;Make It New&quot;: Ezra Pound translated this famous modernist slogan from an ancient Chinese inscription: &quot;As the sun makes it new / Day by day make it new.&quot; What is &quot;it&quot;? What designs guide this &quot;making&quot;? What makes a poem &quot;new&quot;? These questions open broad reaches on the vast river of poetic traditions, materials, experiences, and techniques that English-language poets navigated during the long, turbulent twentieth-century, articulating poetic aims, theories, principles, and manifestos as they did so. In &quot;Tradition and the Individual Talent,&quot; for example, T. S. Eliot asserts that poets must develop a &quot;historical sense,&quot; a knowledge of past literature, so as to seize what is new in their own moment; for his American compeer William Carlos Williams, on the other hand, &quot;So much depends / upon / a red wheel / barrow / glazed with rain / water / beside the white / chickens.&quot; As readers of modern poetry and poetics, we'll aim to deepen our attunement to the multifarious workings of poetic traditions by studying modern poems and poetics in themselves, in dialogue with other poems/poetics in English and translation, and in light of the cultural contexts and poetic resources that inspired them. As we learn about ways poems speak, talk to each other, and engage the resources of poetic language (rhetoric, figurative language, versification, rhythm, music, visual arrangement, &amp;c.), we'll seek both to hone our skill in analyzing and understanding these works and to deepen our ability to feel and appreciate their beauty.", "name": "20th-Century Poetry", "section": "20", "topic": "Modern Poetry and Poetics", "course": "361-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ENGLISH/361-1/34922", "instructor": ["Christine   Froula"], "id": "34922", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
