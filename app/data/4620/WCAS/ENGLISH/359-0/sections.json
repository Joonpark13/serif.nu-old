[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The Bront\u00eb sisters were a source of intense fascination to their Victorian admirers and occasional detractors. Because of their talent and premature deaths, that fascination has grown into a full-scale mythology that celebrates their genius and apparent isolation on the Yorkshire moors. Like all myths, this one contains an element of truth, but it has also hampered readers wanting a deeper understanding of their artistic strengths and intellectual perspectives. In this course, we will not ignore the mythology, but we'll try to set it aside to study how several remarkable novels and poems by Anne, Emily, and Charlotte Bront\u00eb established a powerful critique of Victorian society, including its almost unbridled support for industrialization, its intensive focus on domesticity and marriage (and related laws), and its judgments against single women. We will also trace the formal development of their fiction, including its debt to Romanticism, its preoccupation with narrative voice, its commitment to partial detachment, and its movement toward a distinctly \"modern\" narrative, full of intriguing philosophical riddles.", "name": "Studies in Victorian Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Parkes Hall 212", "topic": "The Brontes: Testimony, Critique & Detachment", "course": "359-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ENGLISH/359-0/34921", "instructor": ["Christopher   Lane"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34921", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
