Although the course readings will focus primarily on documentary, historical, and realist works, students are encouraged to pursue interests in other genres and styles.<br/><br/>The point of departure for our collective readings will be the rhetorical figure of &quot;metastasis&quot; or displacement. We will examine metastasis not only in formal terms?as the production of narrative movement through sequences of static images, but also in historical terms?as psychological and physical displacements wrought by Japanese and Jewish immigration to the United States, Japanese American internment, and the Holocaust."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture, discussion, writing and drawing exercises (no previous artistic experience assumed or required)."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation; Weekly exercises culminating in a final presentation and research paper (12-15 pages)."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Henry Kiyama, The Four Immigrants Manga (1904-1924);<br/>Liana Finck., A Bintel Brief: Love and Longing in Old New York (2014);<br/>Michael Chabon, The Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay (2000);<br/>Taro Yashima, The New Sun (1943);<br/>Min\u00e9 Okubo, Citizen 13660 (1946);<br/>Art Spiegelman, Maus I: A Survivor's Tale (1986);<br/>Yoshihiro Tatsumi, A Drifting Life (2009);<br/>Will Eisner, A Contract with God (1978)."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Post 1830"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:59 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
