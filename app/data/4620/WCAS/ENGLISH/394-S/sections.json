[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "his course will allow you to explore how fiction works. We'll be looking at, discussing, writing about, commenting on, and researching the elements of fiction, but mostly what we'll be doing is writing buckets (you will be turning in a completed piece every other week during the Fall quarter), so we'll be reading mostly to steal: we'll figure out what works and we'll use it for our own material. We'll be engaged in the reading of a concise, funny book on the craft of fiction, and we'll also be reading a wide and varied array of short stories. Again, though, this work is geared to do one simple thing: to find out what means and modes of expression you best respond to, and to figure out ways to approach this question: Given all the other potentially more awesome forms of entertainment out there, what is the role of sitting around scribbling things and reading other people's scribblings? Why do it? Just so you know, what we're doing in class closely replicates what all successful fiction writers do on a daily basis: reading the work of their peers and those of established and emerging authors with care, attention, and greed, and writing copious amounts to see what sticks. The more you do both of these activities, the better and more confident you'll get.", "name": "Theory &amp; Practice of Fiction", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "394-S", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ENGLISH/394-S/34930", "instructor": ["Naeem   Murr"], "id": "34930", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
