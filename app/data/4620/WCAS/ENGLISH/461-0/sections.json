[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar examines the field of theoretical writing occasioned by the proliferation of digital computational technologies in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It focuses on a series of topics and writings organized by the confluence of time, technology, and the subject. If temporal experience lies at the basis of subjectivity (Kant) and time is essentially technical (Stiegler), it may follow that the historical development and dissemination of digital media brokers new forms of subjectivity. What are these new forms of subjectivity and what aesthetic forms instantiate and express their social and political efficacy? <br/><br/>Topics may include: the temporal object, electronic literature, the event, media archaeology, the predictive powers of datamining, the emergence of networked aesthetic genres such as animated .gifs, the time of affect, precarity, debt, and \"always on\" computing. Aesthetic works for analysis may include works by Frances Stark, John Cayley, Ken Jacobs, William Poundstone, Thomson & Craighead, and others. We will read works by prominent scholars in the field of digital media studies (Hayles, Hansen, Kirschenbaum) and pay close attention to the ways in which their writings draw upon more established figures (Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze).<br/><br/> While not a survey per se, the course will function as an introduction to digital media studies and presumes no prior technical training or familiarity with the field.", "name": "Studies in Contemporary Literature", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 018", "topic": "Digital Media Theory: Time, Tech, and the Subject", "course": "461-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ENGLISH/461-0/34973", "instructor": ["James Joseph Hodge"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34973", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
