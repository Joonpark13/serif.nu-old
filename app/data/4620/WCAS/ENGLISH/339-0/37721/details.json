The first cluster of plays focuses on examples of &quot;Performing Race in Shakespeare.&quot; The second group on &quot;Shakespeare's Women&quot; explores the range and variety of the roles and identities available to female characters. The third section examines how &quot;Shakespeare's Endings&quot; are constructed in generic forms from comedy to tragedy and inquires to what extent these conclusions resolve the problems that have emerged over the course of an individual drama.<br/><br/>Ultimately our goal will be to combine these three perspectives as overlapping approaches that lead to a comprehensive discussion of the complexities of Shakespeare's work. <br/><br/>Finally, the title &quot;Shakespeare in Our Time&quot; asks us to reflect on our contemporary position with regard to Shakespeare as an author who is located in both past and present. How can the two points?1616 and 2016?on the long historical timeline be linked without being simply equated?"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Pre 1830<br/><br/>Note: The above course is combined with another department.
