Germanic paganism brought its monsters, its defiant heroism, and its expectation of a coming &quot;twilight of the gods,&quot; while Celtic paganism supplied fairy temptresses, magical objects, and mysterious Otherworld visitors. Classical paganism contributed the pantheon of Greco-Roman gods and goddesses, a stoic resignation to divine will, and an elaborate mythology of love. Contrary to popular belief, the Church did not suppress the use of pagan sources in vernacular literature. But it is fascinating to see how medieval writers adapted and transformed the narrative materials they inherited, producing sophisticated texts that present an overtly Christian point of view layered above tantalizing and elusive pagan subtexts. We will read a selection of Old and Middle English works and several others translated from the French, learning in the process how malign Fate was converted into the providential will of an all-seeing God; how Chaucer integrated Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Diana into a Christian worldview; and how a Celtic goddess's cauldron of plenty became the Holy Grail?the chalice from which Christ and his apostles drank at the Last Supper."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Mainly discussion; a few lectures."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation, four 10-minute quizzes, three 5-7 pp. papers (creative options allowed)."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Beowulf, trans.
