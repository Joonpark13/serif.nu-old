As we accompany protagonists along their journeys to maturity, we watch them learn, fall in love, develop ambitions, encounter disappointment, and emerge?older and hopefully wiser?on the other side. We will read a few major novels in this course, including Great Expectations (Charles Dickens), Midnight's Children (Salman Rushdie), and Orlando (Virginia Woolf). As we put these engrossing works of fiction in dialogue with each other, we will focus especially on the relationship between individuals' aspirations and the ever-changing societies they inhabit. How do people come to understand themselves and the world around them? What causes protagonists to be rewarded or thwarted in their aims? Is the individual defined primarily by his social duty to others, or by his own desires? What forms can education take, and what kinds of knowledge do different educations afford? We will supplement our literary texts with short contemporary readings on topics such as higher education, ethics, and consumerism."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:57 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
