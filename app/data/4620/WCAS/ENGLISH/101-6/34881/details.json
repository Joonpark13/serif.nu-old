We will read intensively a small set of plays and other texts by and about William Shakespeare in order to think about sex, sexuality, gender, and desire in his time and ours. How can we &quot;translate&quot; the foreign-yet-familiar languages and intensities of human interaction and emotion we read in Shakespeare into our own understanding? What acts, affections, emotions, and identities counted as &quot;sex&quot; in Shakespeare's time? How can we begin to understand the &quot;sex&quot; of a writer one of whose central skills was continually to cross-voice himself as a variety of women (and sometimes women as young men)? Alongside our close reading, discussion, and writing about A Midsummer Night's Dream, Venus and Adonis, Othello the Moor of Venice, The Two Noble Kinsmen, and Twelfth Night, Or What You Will, we will sample biographies (Shakespeare in Love) and feminist and queer criticism that attempt to answer the question of Shakespeare's sex."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:57 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
