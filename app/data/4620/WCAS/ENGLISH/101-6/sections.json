[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What was Shakespeare's sex? We will read intensively a small set of plays and other texts by and about William Shakespeare in order to think about sex, sexuality, gender, and desire in his time and ours. How can we \"translate\" the foreign-yet-familiar languages and intensities of human interaction and emotion we read in Shakespeare into our own understanding? What acts, affections, emotions, and identities counted as \"sex\" in Shakespeare's time? How can we begin to understand the \"sex\" of a writer one of whose central skills was continually to cross-voice himself as a variety of women (and sometimes women as young men)? Alongside our close reading, discussion, and writing about A Midsummer Night's Dream, Venus and Adonis, Othello the Moor of Venice, The Two Noble Kinsmen, and Twelfth Night, Or What You Will, we will sample biographies (Shakespeare in Love) and feminist and queer criticism that attempt to answer the question of Shakespeare's sex.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 018", "topic": "Shakespeare's Sex", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ENGLISH/101-6/34881", "instructor": ["Jeffrey A Masten"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>", "id": "34881", "subject": "ENGLISH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "\"The arts of building from the bee receive,\" urged Alexander Pope (Essay on Man, Epis. iii.1.175).

We'll explore honeybee ecology in relation to human culture through collaborative research and reading, documentary and feature films, and possible visits with experts on the science, natural and cultural history, and practical knowledge of bees. Each student will take an active part both in designing our common goals and in shaping lines of research and analysis for his or her own course projects. These will include a research paper and a personal essay or creative work.

Beginning in the 1960s, the tradition of the \"neo-slave narrative\" emerged within African American literature. We will investigate why and how this literary form developed and how the diverse texts that make up this tradition reimagine the past and reorient the present. Our explorations will center on the utility of different narrative modes, from realism to experimentalism, in addressing issues of loss, reparation, historiography, and cultural appropriation. We will begin with key 19th-century narratives by Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs before turning to latter-day representations of slavery, including Toni Morrison's novel Beloved, Kyle Baker's graphic novel Nat Turner, stories from John Keene's Counternarratives, and Natasha Trethewey's poetry collection Native Guard.
