We will analyze writing strategies and techniques, and we will carefully go over the &quot;rules&quot; - and when a confident writer might want to play around with, or break, them. The papers will be varied and geared to life both in and out of the academy.<br/><br/>PROJECTS: Students will complete several exercises, two short papers, and two longer papers.
