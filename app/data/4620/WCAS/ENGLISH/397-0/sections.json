[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "When your high school English teacher praised &quot;rounded&quot; literary characters at the expense of &quot;flat&quot; ones, he or she was praising the novelistic over the allegorical, representing the latter as at best an antiquated literary form and at worst a vehicle for heavy-handed indoctrination. This seminar will challenge such assumptions by investigating allegory as a dynamic and still vital literary form. We will proceed by reading canonical allegorical texts and foundational works of allegorical theory in conjunction with more recent examinations of similar themes: Prudentius' gruesome Psychomachia alongside Paul de Man's &quot;Rhetoric of Temporality&quot; and Joss Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer; Boethius' stately Consolation of Philosophy alongside the American icon Lady Liberty; William Langland's Piers Plowman alongside Ernst Kantorowicz's The King's Two Bodies and Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek; and the morality play Everyman alongside the 1957 and 2007 versions of the western The 3:10 to Yuma. Together, we will produce descriptions of these authors' allegorical practices that take into account their complexity. In what ways are allegory and allegorical personifications useful instruments for thinking? What kinds of reading practices do they seem to allow or encourage? What kinds of work do they do that novelistic characters cannot? These shared texts will provide a rich conceptual background for students' research into an allegorical figure of their own choosing. Working closely with each other as well as the instructor, students will learn to navigate electronic databases, identify and evaluate pertinent critical articles, and produce article abstracts, an annotated bibliography, and a project proposal, culminating in a 12-15 page research paper.", "name": "Research Seminar for Literature Majors", "section": "20", "topic": "Allegory: From Rome to Star Trek", "course": "397-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ENGLISH/397-0/35051", "instructor": ["Katharine Helen Breen"], "id": "35051", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
