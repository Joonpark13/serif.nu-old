It is a period framed by symbolic disasters, inaugurated by &quot;the end of civilization&quot; with the fall of Rome and concluding with the anxieties surrounding the year 1000, when the world was supposed to end. And yet, despite these morbid markers, it was a time of immense creativity and energy during which the characteristic fusion of Roman, German, and Christian traditions laid the groundwork for European culture. Topics will include gender, Christianity, and the fall of Rome; monasticism and the preservation of culture; the rise of Islam; the &quot;Barbarian Emperor&quot; Charlemagne; feudalism, and the gradual ascendance of the papacy."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "lecture and discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "class participation; 2 short papers (ca. 5 pp. each); 2 exams."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "TENTATIVE READING LIST:<br/>Gregory of Tours, The Life of the Fathers .
