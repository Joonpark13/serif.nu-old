But also work hard! This course traces the history of modern American culture by examining prominent movies from the dawn of film in the 1890s to the present. It is NOT a history of American film, but instead a history of American culture that uses film as historical evidence. Most students find that movies fun to engage but challenging to use as historical documents, so this course is not &quot;easy.&quot; Students should have comfort with and interest in film and some knowledge of modern US history. Each Tuesday session will be devoted to lecture (broken up by film clips and a mid-class pause); each Thursday session to screening a film. The unusual scheduling of these sessions is necessary to provide time for viewing a few longer films fully in one session, but most sessions will end by 5:00 or 5:15. Students are required to attend lecture and movie sessions (as well as discussion sections), at which attendance will be taken because viewing assigned films in isolation on some little computer screen is no substitute for seeing them on a large screen in a group setting, as most films were viewed in the past. Do NOT take this class if you foresee scheduling conflicts with lecture and movie sessions or discussion sections: simply showing up is a vital part of the work in this class."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lectures, films, and discussion sections"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Several short essays, together determining most of the grade; attendance at all sessions and participation in discussion determining the remainder."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "TENTATIVE READING LIST: <br/>Readings: numerous short scholarly and popular writings. <br/><br/>TENTATIVE FILM LIST:<br/>The Birth of a Nation (Griffith 1915) Baby Face (Green 1933) Double Indemnity (Wilder 1944) Rebel Without a Cause (Ray 1955) Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (Nichols 1966) Network (Lumet 1976) Blade Runner (Scott 1982) Do The Right Thing (Spike Lee 1989) Brokeback Mountain (Ang Lee 2005) The Social Network (Fincher 2010) Plus documentaries from Turner Classic Movies and other sources."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Attendance at first class mandatory<br/><br/>HISTORY AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Americas"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:03 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
