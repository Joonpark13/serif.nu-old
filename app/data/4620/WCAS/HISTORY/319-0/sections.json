It examines the U.S.'s westward expansion across the continent and throughout the western hemisphere, how its imperial presence crossed the Pacific to encroach upon Asia, evolved through two world wars, the global Cold War and into the present. The central theme of the course is how American international power arose, mutually constitutive with the U.S.'s territorial and commercial expansion and violent encounters with other nations, cultures and empires within and beyond the American continent. Using the analytical lenses of race, religion and gender, we will compare the diverse American visions and goals of expansionism. We will also critique how U.S. international power has been shaped by seminal events such as the U.S.'s removal of Indians, war with Great Britain, and the colonial project in the Philippines. Coming up on the twentieth century, we discuss how the U.S. competed and collaborated with other great powers, how ideas such as self-determination, communism, race and modernization affected the exercise of American power, and how smaller powers and non-state actors exerted influence upon U.S. domestic and foreign policy.", "qtr": "Spring 2016", "name": "History of US Foreign Relations", "title": "WCAS HISTORY 319-0-20 History of US Foreign Relations", "lmod": "4/3/16 8:03 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Wen-Qing   Ngoei", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "319-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course explores American foreign relations from when the United States was a small republic on the eastern seaboard of North America up to the present.
