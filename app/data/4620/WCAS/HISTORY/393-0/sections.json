We will unpack the concepts and practices of oral history by discussing the theoretical and methodological challenges that professional historians and social scientists confronted when doing oral history in the region and beyond. Then, we will study the \"archives of terror\" of the Dirty Wars of Central and South America (1960s-1990s), in which various forms of orality (i.e. documentary film, testimony, life histories, interviews, and truth commissions) helped victims of violence as well as perpetrators to intervene in the peace processes and/or democratic transitions seeking justice, reparation, forgiveness, forgetfulness, amnesty, and immunity. We will analyze the political, epistemological, ethical, and aesthetical limitations of these efforts to heal the wounds of state-led violence, dictatorship, genocide, and guerrilla warfare. The overarching goal of the course is to understand oral history as a prism that reflects and refracts oral and written forms of making sense of the past, and to understand why it has played such a fundamental role in the definition of the \"historical truth\" in the turbulence of Latin America at the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first.", "qtr": "Spring 2016", "name": "Approaches to History", "title": "WCAS HISTORY 393-0-20 Approaches to History", "lmod": "4/3/16 8:04 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Lina M Britto", "instructor_addr": "Harris Hall 302"}], "topic": "Oral Hist & Terror Archives in Latin Amer", "course": "393-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course helps students understand oral history as part of a political battlefield in Latin America in which popular political consciousness, collective identities, and social movements are made.
