We will consider the role that the concept of wilderness has played in the conservation and environmental movements, and the ways that it both grounds those movements and pushes them in problematic directions, especially as it relates to the underrepresented wilderness experiences of particular social groups. Finally, we will consider the abstract issues of wilderness in terms of specific wilderness areas in the late-twentieth-century United States."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Short papers based on class readings and discussions and a final research project."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "HISTORY AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Americas"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:04 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
