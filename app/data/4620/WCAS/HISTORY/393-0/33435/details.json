This seminar explores some of the ways people and things circulated between China and &quot;the West&quot; (primarily Great Britain but also continental Europe and, to a lesser extent, the United States) from roughly 1839 to the mid-twentieth century. The course primarily will focus on the Euro-American influence on modern China, but we will not ignore the question of how China contributed to the transformation of the modern West. We will concentrate on particular topics (intellectual and scientific exchange, the transformation of women's lives, the opium trade, the missionary enterprise, war, and treaty ports as sites of cultural hybridity and change). Students will also write a term paper on a particular topic of interest to them."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar (I will begin the class with two lectures to ensure that all seminar participants have a basic historical knowledge of the subject)."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Discussion, one short (2-3 pages) analytical paper, one term paper (10-15 pages)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "TENTATIVE READING LIST: TBA, but will include a mixture of primary source material [for example, J.D.
