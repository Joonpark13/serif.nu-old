Saudi Arabia?perhaps the most important country in the Arab world today?will receive particular attention, but the course will also cover Yemen, the Sultanate of Oman and the smaller states of the Persian Gulf (Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates). Moreover, the lectures will address a number of issues that have transnational significance, including: the Saudi conquests since the late 18th century; European colonialism in the Arabian Peninsula; tribalism and state formation; the discovery of oil and its impact; political economy; the &quot;Arab Cold War;&quot; civil strife and guerilla movements; the nature of political regimes in the region; religious activism; violence and delinquency, and the prospects for federalism and monetary union.", "name": "New Lectures in History", "section": "22", "topic": "The Arabian Peninsula Since the 18th Century", "course": "300-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HISTORY/300-0/33425", "instructor": ["Henri   Lauziere"], "id": "33425", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "To understand how and why narcotrafficking became one of the most profitable and violent industries in the hemisphere, this course examines the history of production, commercialization, consumption and criminalization of mind-altering drugs in the Americas.

It was only slowly, over the course of a century, that a philosophy of science evolved in which epistemology, having been historicized in some manner, began to re-connect the separated contexts of justification and discovery. The organizing thread for this class will be the contribution that different streams of twentieth-century philosophy of science made to this overall process. The class proceeds from the assumption that historicizing epistemology captures the essence of what the past century has added to the philosophy of science. The class will discuss an array of French-, German-, and English-speaking traditions in which historical thinking is brought into philosophy of science. Readings will include Gaston Bachelard, Georges Canguilhem, Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida (his reading of Husserl) on the French-speaking part; Ernst Cassirer, Edmund Husserl (especially his late &quot;Crisis&quot; work), and Martin Heidegger on the German-speaking part; and the work of the Polish immunologist and philosopher Ludwik Fleck, Thomas Kuhn, Stephen Toulmin, and Ian Hacking on the English-speaking part.
