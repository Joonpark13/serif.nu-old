We consider the late colonial history of the export of tropical commodities as stimulants; the repression of domestic consumption and its connection to the formation of national identities; the correlation between liberal reforms and the emergence of transnational illegal networks; the construction of the &quot;drug problem&quot; during the period after World War II; the rise of the cartels along circuits of immigration; the implementation of the &quot;war on drugs&quot; as an essential component of Cold War in Latin America; the role of violence and masculinity in the drug trade; and the most recent debates on decriminalization and legalization in North and South America. We address these topics in an interdisciplinary manner, reading history, anthropology, sociology, political science and journalism, and watching and analyzing critically featured films and documentaries."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Attendance and participation, in-class quizzes, response papers, and final paper."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "READING LIST: <br/>Sidney Mintz, &quot;The Forefathers of Crack,&quot; NACLA Report on the Americas 22, no. 6, (1989); Paul B.
