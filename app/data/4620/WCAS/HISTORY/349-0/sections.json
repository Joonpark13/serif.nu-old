[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines the Holocaust of European Jewry from its origins through its aftermath. We will read first-hand accounts and analyze primary documents written by the victims and perpetrators as we seek to understand the causes, consequences, and extent of Germany's genocidal policies from the rise of the Nazis to their ultimate defeat. From Vichy France in the West to the occupied Soviet territories in the East, the persecution, expropriation, and murder of millions involved civilians and state officials at all levels of government. With a focus on German-occupied Poland, where the greatest number of Jewish victims lived and perished, we will explore questions of local complicity, the motives of perpetrators, and the responses of the region's Jews to the onslaught. The course will end with a consideration of the fate of the survivors and the attempts by postwar European states to identify and punish the perpetrators of and profiteers from the Holocaust.", "name": "History of the Holocaust", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "349-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HISTORY/349-0/33382", "instructor": ["Benjamin   Frommer"], "id": "33382", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
