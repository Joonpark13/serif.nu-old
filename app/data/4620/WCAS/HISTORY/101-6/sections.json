[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "One of the distinguishing characteristics of western civilization has been its persistent concern to adjudicate disputes and to judge alleged wrong-doers through the process of a trial. The forms of trials and standards of evidence have changed a great deal since ancient times when Socrates was condemned to death, and yet the trial still remains the principal means through which society makes its most important judgments. Trials are also exceptionally revealing of the basic values in society. What distinguishes the great trials has been how they uncover conflicts about those values, how they preserve for prosperity a sensitivity for justice and injustice, how they symbolize conflicting values, and how often they have stimulated great works of philosophy and literature. In this course we shall analyze a few of the most famous trials from the ancient world to the twentieth century and ask such questions as what is justice and injustice, what is the role of persuasive rhetoric in trials, how have trials constructed evidence for and against defendants, and most importantly how have the trials of certain individuals stimulated a debate about the fundamental values of society?", "name": "First-Year Seminar-European History", "section": "20", "topic": "The Great Trials of Western Civilization", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HISTORY/101-6/33344", "instructor": ["Edward Wallace   Muir Jr"], "id": "33344", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
