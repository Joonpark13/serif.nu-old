In this course, we will take a different approach and start from the assumptions that the context of scientific inquiry influences its content, and that history provides us with essential tools for understanding science and its relation to society. This will not only shed light on the history of modern science and technology; it should also broaden our understanding of the world beyond. This is perhaps nowhere more important than in the modern histories of the non-Western world, places that have long been regarded as inferior precisely with reference to scientific and technological innovation. This course will explore how that dynamic has played itself out globally, as well as in local non-Western contexts. Among other things, we will explore the non-West's role as a &quot;living laboratory&quot; for western science, by sampling the rich European travel and research literature on Africa and Asia. The course will also consider local histories of science and technology from a range of indigenous perspectives, by reading Indian, African, and Middle Eastern scientists and intellectuals.", "name": "Topics In History", "section": "26", "topic": "Non-Western Science and Technology in the Modern W", "course": "392-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HISTORY/392-0/33397", "instructor": ["Fredrik   Meiton"], "id": "33397", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The theme of the &quot;end of days&quot; threatens to overwhelm us in popular media; even the United States government is capitalizing on the obsession with the &quot;zombie&quot; apocalypse to encourage emergency preparedness. Apocalypses are not just exciting stories, they have long roots in the Western tradition, particularly in Christianity, science, and the Enlightenment, and they have many uses. They can narrate a great victory for the morally righteous, become a foil for a critique of enlightenment or industrial progress, and unveil the gateway to utopia. Apocalyptic stories also often reinforce previously held assumptions about humans, nature, and human nature, holding within them a regenerative moment when humanity (or some select part of it) could finally get things right. As a result, the end of days makes an excellent category of historical analysis. <br/><br/>In this class, we will take a long view on the history of Western apocalypse stories both providential and dystopian. Our guiding query will be always to ask: what work did these narratives do for people in different historical contexts? What can the examination these narratives tell us about history in these various times and places? Our reading will focus heavily on the histories of empire, science, religion, and nature/environment in Europe (particularly Britain) and America. Specific themes will include the link between the revolutionary and the apocalyptic, human and divine agency, limits/scarcity and growth/abundance, utopias, concepts of time, and history.", "name": "Topics In History", "section": "30", "topic": "Apocalypse: Envrn, Hist, Scien", "course": "392-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HISTORY/392-0/33398", "instructor": ["Sheila Two Wille"], "id": "33398", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
