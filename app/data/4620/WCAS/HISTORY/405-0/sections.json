[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar examines the contributions of historical inquiry to gender analysis and queer critical practices. Readings will provide a broad survey of the fractious impact of post-structuralist theories since the 1980s and 90s on the urgent vindicationalist scholarship emanating from the women's and gay liberation movements of the 1960s and 70s. Through key monographs and articles, students will examine how historians have negotiated this turn by first understanding how historical research has deepened explanations of oppression and repression. Secondly, by understanding the centrality of differences to historical investigation, we see the crucial role of historical methods in de-stabilizing received binaries and in creating critical distance from normative assumptions. Finally, this course traces how these political commitments of scholars have transformed the archival, interpretative, and narrative practices of the academic discipline in explicating how feminist and queer stances on knowledge have altered historical reasoning and our understandings of the past.", "name": "Seminar in Historical Analysis", "section": "20", "location": "University Library 3622", "topic": "Gender and Sexuality", "course": "405-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HISTORY/405-0/33403", "instructor": ["Tessie P Liu"], "class_attributes": "Graduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "33403", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "If the nineteenth century witnessed the rise of positivism, the twentieth century started with a crisis of positivistic thought without a clear response, or even alternative, to the nineteenth-century legacy. It was only slowly, over the course of a century, that a philosophy of science evolved in which epistemology, having been historicized in some manner, began to re-connect the separated contexts of justification and discovery. The organizing thread for this class will be the contribution that different streams of twentieth-century philosophy of science made to this overall process. The class proceeds from the assumption that historicizing epistemology captures the essence of what the past century has added to the philosophy of science. The class will discuss an array of French-, German-, and English-speaking traditions in which historical thinking is brought into philosophy of science. Readings will include Gaston Bachelard, Georges Canguilhem, Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida (his reading of Husserl) on the French-speaking part; Ernst Cassirer, Edmund Husserl (especially his late \"Crisis\" work), and Martin Heidegger on the German-speaking part; and the work of the Polish immunologist and philosopher Ludwik Fleck, Thomas Kuhn, Stephen Toulmin, and Ian Hacking on the English-speaking part. Recent developments in history and philosophy of science will also come under discussion throughout the class.", "name": "Seminar in Historical Analysis", "section": "22", "location": "University Hall 122", "topic": "Historical Epistemologies", "course": "405-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:00PM - 7:50PM", "Tu 5:00PM - 6:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HISTORY/405-0/33404", "instructor": ["Peter D Fenves", "Johanngeorg   Rheinberger"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33404", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In recent years historians have developed a new technique called microhistory for capturing the lives of the people who have been lost to history?peasants, heretics, poor women, gays, and con-conformists of all sorts. These were the people who because of their low social status, rural origins, illiteracy, or unpopular beliefs were ignored, despised, or persecuted by the dominant society. Microhistory is a method of investigation that usually relies on the evidence from judicial trials of otherwise obscure people who found themselves in trouble with the authorities. The method gives a voice to those who otherwise left no written record of their lives. The result of the studies has been a remarkable re-evaluation of the experiences and beliefs of the common people of pre-modern Europe.", "name": "Seminar in Historical Analysis", "section": "24", "location": "Harris Hall L40", "topic": "Microhistory", "course": "405-0", "meeting_time": ["We 9:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HISTORY/405-0/33405", "instructor": ["Edward Wallace   Muir Jr"], "class_attributes": "Graduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "33405", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
