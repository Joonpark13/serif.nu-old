But these polarities were never stable. The worst sinners frequently made the best saints: throughout the Middle Ages, society was fascinated by the drama of moral conversion expressed in the lives of the legendary &quot;prostitute&quot; saints. But conceptions of sanctity and sin also fluctuated in response to social change. Once Christianity became the dominant religion, tales of martyrdom gave way to acts of self-mortification. By the same token, sin tended to be assessed in terms of actions and their consequences in the early Middle Ages. In the twelfth century, however, there was a revolutionary emphasis on conscience that tended to locate sin in the intention. Society's spiritual heroes and sinful ne'er do wells constitute prisms through which the moral universe is refracted."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Research paper"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "READING LIST: <br/>Clanchy, Michael, ed.
