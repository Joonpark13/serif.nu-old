[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar aims to provide students with an opportunity to explore the intellectual exchanges between, and cross pollination among, thinkers from both Arab and European/American societies in the modern period (especially since the mid-19th century). Our main focus will be on the Arab intellectuals and their literary output. Following some core readings, students will work toward the production of a term paper based on primary sources. Depending on the students' linguistic abilities and/or the availability of translations, possible topics might include the rise of nationalist ideas and other political mass ideologies, the impact of the social sciences on Islamic scholarship, changing views of socio-political \"progress,\" and the question of feminism. The seminar will also cover some methodological issues to help students with the writing process.", "name": "Research Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "University Library 4670", "topic": "Arab Intellectuals and Modernity", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HISTORY/395-0/33399", "instructor": ["Henri   Lauziere"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "33399", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Medieval saints and sinners were embodiments of the struggle between good and evil. But these polarities were never stable. The worst sinners frequently made the best saints: throughout the Middle Ages, society was fascinated by the drama of moral conversion expressed in the lives of the legendary \"prostitute\" saints. But conceptions of sanctity and sin also fluctuated in response to social change. Once Christianity became the dominant religion, tales of martyrdom gave way to acts of self-mortification. By the same token, sin tended to be assessed in terms of actions and their consequences in the early Middle Ages. In the twelfth century, however, there was a revolutionary emphasis on conscience that tended to locate sin in the intention. Society's spiritual heroes and sinful ne'er do wells constitute prisms through which the moral universe is refracted.", "name": "Research Seminar", "section": "22", "location": "University Hall 418", "topic": "Medieval Saints and Sinners", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HISTORY/395-0/33400", "instructor": ["Dyan H Elliott"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "33400", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "One explanation of the destruction of the Soviet Empire is that in 1985 Mikhail Gorbachev became the Soviet leader, understood that the Soviet Union was in a state of crisis, set out to introduce necessary reforms, over time undertook increasingly radical economic and political reforms that completely destabilized Soviet society and, in 1991, destroyed the Soviet Union. Even if you think that's more or less what happened, Soviet society was so large, and so complex, that the larger story was composed of many separate but overlapping stories. Members of the seminar will explore one of those smaller stories: why did the economic reforms create an ever deepening economic crisis? Why did the Soviet government lose control over the constituent Soviet republics (pick a republic)? Why did Gorbachev introduce competitive elections, and what were their consequences? Why did the many senior members of the Soviet government and Communist Party who opposed what Gorbachev was doing not kick him out of power? Why do many Russians seem to have been willing to allow many of the non-Russian republics to secede? Did the economic pressure on the Soviet Union exerted by the Reagan arms buildup contribute to the collapse, as some believe? And there are many other important components of the Soviet collapse to explore. You will try to answer your question by reading the many primary sources that are available in English translation, memoirs by Soviet leaders, and relevant scholarly studies.", "name": "Research Seminar", "section": "24", "location": "Parkes Hall 224", "topic": "Death of the Soviet Empire", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HISTORY/395-0/33401", "instructor": ["John Starkes   Bushnell"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33401", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
