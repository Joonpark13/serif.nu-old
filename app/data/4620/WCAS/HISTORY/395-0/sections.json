Why did the Soviet government lose control over the constituent Soviet republics (pick a republic)? Why did Gorbachev introduce competitive elections, and what were their consequences? Why did the many senior members of the Soviet government and Communist Party who opposed what Gorbachev was doing not kick him out of power? Why do many Russians seem to have been willing to allow many of the non-Russian republics to secede? Did the economic pressure on the Soviet Union exerted by the Reagan arms buildup contribute to the collapse, as some believe?
