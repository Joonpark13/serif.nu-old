[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is a survey course covering the Ottoman Empire from the seventeenth century to the outbreak of WWI. We will follow the process through which a multi-confessional, multi-lingual empire spanning an area that makes up the modern Balkans and the Middle East turned into a frail political entity at the fringes of Europe. We will learn about the changing nature of the Ottoman state, the changes in its political geography, and explore the experience of modernity in a non-western context.", "name": "The Ottomans: From &quot;Second Empire&quot; to the Age of Nationalism, 1622-1918", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "373-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HISTORY/373-2/33433", "instructor": ["Ipek Kocaomer Yosmaoglu"], "id": "33433", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
