Using insights from various fields of the social sciences, including political science, sociology, economics, anthropology, law, and history, we will explore the dynamics of the operation and influence of power within, on, and over black communities. Topics include: linked fate and the boundaries of blackness; gender, sexualities, and intersectionality; class, wealth, and work; black politics and neoliberalism; elections and elite politics; the black presidency; #BlackLivesMatter; and the politics of race, space, and place.
