Using insights from various fields of the social sciences, including political science, sociology, economics, anthropology, law, and history, we will explore the dynamics of the operation and influence of power within, on, and over black communities. Topics include: linked fate and the boundaries of blackness; gender, sexualities, and intersectionality; class, wealth, and work; black politics and neoliberalism; elections and elite politics; the black presidency; #BlackLivesMatter; and the politics of race, space, and place. During this quarter we will think about how we can usefully and systematically analyze how African Americans participate in politics and society, pursue their interests, and interact with the state and other social groups. Our goal is to be systematic, empirically grounded, theoretically informed, critical, rigorous, and fair in our analyses. Material for readings and assignments will be drawn from primary sources, academic literature, and the politics of the everyday."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:42 PM (CT)", "subject": "AF_AM_ST"}]
