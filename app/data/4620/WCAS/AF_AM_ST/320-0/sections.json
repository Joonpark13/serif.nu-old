This class investigates racial identities, classifications, and interactions as they are formulated and practiced. Emphasis will be on African Americans, but there will be significant consideration of other racial and ethnic groups in the U.S., and the social construction of race outside of the U.S.. After a brief introduction about the historical establishment of racial identity and classification, the course has three parts: First, we explore the malleability of race across time and place, which illustrates its social nature. Second, we examine \"race\" in combination with the cross-cutting axes of class, gender, sexuality, religion, etc. Finally, the third part of the course focuses on the ramifications of racial classification in politics, economics, policies and institutions. The goal is that students challenge their own assumptions about racial categories, apply what they learn to their own experiences and perceptions, and gain a better understanding of how such identities and classifications shape the nature of stratification and inequality in this country. This course is part of the pilot program for the proposed Social Inequalities and Diversities requirement in WCAS.", "qtr": "Spring 2016", "name": "Social Meaning of Race", "title": "WCAS AF_AM_ST 320-0-20 Social Meaning of Race", "lmod": "4/3/16 7:42 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-3409", "instructor_name": "Mary E Pattillo", "instructor_addr": "1860 Campus Dr. Crowe 5-111"}], "topic": "", "course": "320-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Race is a social and political category.
