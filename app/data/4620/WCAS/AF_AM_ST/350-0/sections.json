[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course we will examine the various ways Black scholars, artists, &amp; writers, use science fiction and visionary fiction to imagine freedom and new world orders. We will focus on the role of history, particular slavery, in the Black radical imagination. Freedom is the keyword throughout the course. We will grapple with the various and sometimes conflicting meanings and uses of freedom as it relates to blackness, gender, sexuality, class and ability. We will explore multiple forms of scholarship and cultural productions which include: film, music, novels, short-stories, art, poetry, and other academic texts. <br/><br/>All students will be asked to discover and develop their writerly voices through various critical, creative, experimental and performative assignments. This course requires active participation (show up!).<br/><br/>In this course we will be dealing with complex and sometimes personal topics; therefore, it is key that we create and maintain a safe and educational atmosphere. Many of the topics may be near and dear to us, while others may be new. I encourage you to bring your perspectives into the class, but please be reflexive, be informed, and be respectful to your peers and your instructor.", "name": "Theorizing Blackness", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "350-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/AF_AM_ST/350-0/31906", "instructor": ["Kai Marshall Green"], "id": "31906", "subject": "AF_AM_ST"}]
