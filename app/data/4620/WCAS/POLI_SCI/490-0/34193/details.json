The first is institutional analysis, which focuses on the emergence, operation, reproduction, change, and consequences of institutions. Historical institutionalism is often identified with macro institutional approaches that call attention to the role of power, collective actors, and conflict. The second literature focuses on temporal processes and modes of historical analysis. Historical institutionalism is associated with works that emphasize critical junctures, path dependence, and the temporal sequencing of macro processes."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Graduate students only, Poli Sci and Sociology; others require professor approval"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Graduate seminar"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:17 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
