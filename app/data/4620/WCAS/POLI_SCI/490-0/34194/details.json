How far do we find substantial contributions to theorizing about politics in that format (as opposed to just clever and provocative expressions of strongly held political opinions)? This course considers these questions by way of extended engagement with the work of Aristophanes, blistering satirical depictions of democratic life and politics in during the long Peloponnesian War and into the fourth century BC and some of the most exciting and difficult texts in Greek political theory. The course will start out observing the proliferation of satire in 21st century political discourse and then turn to examine the plays. We will read all 11 surviving plays in translation but focus on close study in historical context of two, Clouds and Lysistrata. We will also attend to the reception history of these two plays, that is, how have they been used and reimagined in contemporary times. The course should benefit students interested in ancient political theory, classical studies broadly, democratic politics and interpretative methods."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Gain skill in interpretative methods in political science, develop familiarity with the topic area."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar with discussion and student presentations."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Regular student presentation of research and a final research paper (15pp)."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Most readings will be posted to CANVAS.
