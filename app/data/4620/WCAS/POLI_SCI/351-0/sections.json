[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course explores the comparative politics of the Middle East and North Africa. The first half of the course focuses on the historical and institutional context of politics and government. Here we examine the emergence of independent states, the consolidation of regimes, and patterns in the relationship between state, society, and economy. We compare explanations for the endurance of authoritarian regimes, examine the role of Islam in politics, and also look at the Iranian Revolution and Islamic Republic. The second half of the course concentrates on dynamics of mobilization and conflict. Here we explore the Arab uprisings that began in late 2010 and their aftermath, current challenges facing the search for stability and democracy in the region, and the origins and evolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.", "name": "Politics of the Middle East", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "351-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/POLI_SCI/351-0/34123", "instructor": ["Wendy R Pearlman"], "id": "34123", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
