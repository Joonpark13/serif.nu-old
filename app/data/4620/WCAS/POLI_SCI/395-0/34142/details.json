The purpose of this research seminar is to examine systematically and comparatively why military interventions are launched and what results they produce on the ground. The seminar, in particular, tries to find answers to the following questions: (1) What were the broad policy arguments in favor of or opposed to a particular intervention? (2) Who were the principal players arguing for intervention? (3) What role did international institutions play in the set-up of the intervention? (4) What specific kinds of military force proved particularly useful in the actual intervention? (6) In each case, do we judge the intervention a success or failure, and how do we explain the success or failure?"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Research seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Final research paper 100% of grade"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "None required."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:17 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
