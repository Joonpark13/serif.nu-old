Never before have 28 sovereign states cooperated more intensely on political, economic, social, judicial and security affairs than is currently the case under the European Union umbrella. This course examines how this \"multi-state\" entity operates in international affairs. What are the power assets of the European Union? How do EU member states cooperate in economic affairs?
