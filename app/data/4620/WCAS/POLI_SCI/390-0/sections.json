The experiences of specific countries in Africa and a few other world regions will be examined closely. After the Cold War, the number of democracies in the world increased significantly. In recent years, however, that number has stagnated and even, by some accounts, declined. The global system today is characterized by growing insecurity and uncertainty. The aim of this course is to achieve a deeper understanding of these dynamics and their implications. The expansion of liberal democracies and liberalized economies was adversely affected by the 9/11 Al Qaeda attack on the World Trade Center and the prolonged wars that followed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. The relentless upsurge in jihadist insurgencies in Africa and elsewhere has steadily shifted global priorities to the strengthening of security and political order. The rise of China and the resurgence of authoritarianism in Russia have contributed to the complexities and uncertainties. So also have the erosion of state systems, forced migrations,and the upsurge in ethnic nationalism and religious sectarianism. The failures of the Arab Spring, and the fracturing of Iraq, Syria, and Libya have had wide ramifications, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.
