The relationship between statistical results and causal relations - the true quantities of interest in most analysis - is obscure and anything but direct for most studies. We will consider a series of methods appropriate for addressing this problems - methods that are generally expected or increasingly common in applied research: experimentation, regression with control variables, instrumental variables, matching, mechanism and regression-discontinuity designs, and panel inference. Finally, we will discuss some approaches to missing data."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Stephen L.
