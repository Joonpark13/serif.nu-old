[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course explores quantitative approaches to causal inference in the social sciences. The relationship between statistical results and causal relations - the true quantities of interest in most analysis - is obscure and anything but direct for most studies. We will consider a series of methods appropriate for addressing this problems - methods that are generally expected or increasingly common in applied research: experimentation, regression with control variables, instrumental variables, matching, mechanism and regression-discontinuity designs, and panel inference. Finally, we will discuss some approaches to missing data.", "name": "Quantitative Causal Inference", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "406-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/POLI_SCI/406-0/34189", "instructor": ["Jason W Seawright"], "id": "34189", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
