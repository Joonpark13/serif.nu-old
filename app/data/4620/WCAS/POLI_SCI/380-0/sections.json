[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The number of refugees, asylum-seekers and internally displaced people worldwide has, for the first time in the post-World War II era, exceeded 50 million people. 16 million of the displaced are refugees. In this course we examine the international and state response to refugee crisis. In order to understand the responsibilities and challenges of responding to refugee crises today, we will look back historically at the creation of the 1951 Refugee Convention regime. We will learn about how the regime was created in response to the plight of refugees in WWII, the failure to take into account the crises of partition in South Asia and the Middle East leading those states to opt out of the Refugee Convention regime and the implications of this history for today's crises. We will consider the challenges of international and regional cooperation. Drawing on case studies we will critically examine different international responses, the constraints of international and regional cooperation in managing a crisis, the politics of camp and urban refugees, why crises become protracted, populations are rendered stateless and the role of human rights in responding to their predicament. Finally, we consider how the new (or not new) ways in which refugee flight takes place (smuggling, migrants at sea, privatization) is a response to the conditions of displacement in camps and urban areas and increasing state securitization.", "name": "Refugee Crises and Human Rights", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "380-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/POLI_SCI/380-0/34275", "instructor": ["Galya Benarieh Ruffer"], "id": "34275", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
