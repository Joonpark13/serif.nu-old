[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, we will develop and apply a translation methodology to French and English texts. We will begin with prose and poetry, then expand our scope to graphic novels, the performing arts (theater and opera), cinema, and advertising. Translating such a wide variety of texts will familiarize us with abstract, idiomatic, highly technical, and colloquial French, and it will enhance our cultural and linguistic competence by teaching us to capture intended implications, judgements, subtleties and nuances. To complement our examination of the issues pertaining to each genre or medium, we will read translation theory and criticism, and we will evaluate published translation works. Coursework will include regular translation exercises (from French to English, and from English to French) and a final project.", "name": "Theory and Practice of Translation", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "391-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/FRENCH/391-0/31096", "instructor": ["Lam-Thao   Nguyen"], "id": "31096", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
