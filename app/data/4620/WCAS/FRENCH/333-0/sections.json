[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The purpose of the seminar is explore in depth the writings of Michel de Montaigne and some of his important interlocutors, in the context of the emergence of modern subjectivity in the period we call &quot;Renaissance&quot;. We will consider a set of problems relative to the constitution of the self, especially in terms of historical, rhetorical, and epistemological paradigms. We will use Montaigne's writings as a gateway into a turbulent and transformative period of history, in which Old World confronted New World, and long-held religious and moral beliefs gave way to doubt and critical reconfiguration. All classes, papers and readings will be entirely in French. We will be engaging in detailed close readings and critical analyses both in writing and in class.", "name": "Topics in Renaissance Literature", "section": "20", "topic": "Montaigne and Modernity", "course": "333-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/FRENCH/333-0/31103", "instructor": ["Cynthia Nyree Nazarian"], "id": "31103", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
