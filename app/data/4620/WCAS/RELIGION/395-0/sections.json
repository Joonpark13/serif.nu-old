[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What is &quot;theory&quot;? What does it mean to have a theory about something? How are theories helpful? What do theories do? What is &quot;religion&quot;? How do things get excluded or included in this category? What counts as &quot;religious&quot; and why? Who gets to decide? This course is an introduction to foundational theories of religion and to the history of the construction of the category of &quot;religion&quot; over time. Throughout the term, you will be working on formulating your own theory of religion, which you will articulate and defend in your final seminar paper. In this course, you will gain (as ritual theorist Catherine Bell says) &quot;the skills and tools to make sure that very complicated situations and ideas can be put into words, thereby making it possible to have discussions about issues that can only be discussed if there is language for reflexivity, nuance, counter-evidence, and doubt.&quot; In the process, you will be asked to make theory translatable to your peers by actively engaging theoretical concepts in creative ways.", "name": "Theories of Religion", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/RELIGION/395-0/34734", "instructor": ["Sarah McFarland Taylor"], "id": "34734", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
