How about the Hebrew Bible? The New Testament? <br/>This is a seminar in which we will slowly and carefully read the core sacred texts of three traditions?Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. At the heart of each of these religious is a Book that is considered holy. It is read and studied and used to justify behavior, especially ethical and moral choices. These texts have been treasured and taught, taken across thousands of years and miles to play a role in our contemporary public life. Typically, these books are only read carefully within their communities. But at the University, we study these texts seriously, thoughtfully and respectfully and pay close attention to their reasons and justifications. We live side by side in a pluralistic American democracy, and we should know what our neighbor holds most dear and finds most true. We will begin to learn by simply reading together and thinking about the reasons of these different Scriptural traditions. No prior expertise needed."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:20 PM (CT)", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
