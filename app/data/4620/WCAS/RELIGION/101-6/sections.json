[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Have you ever read the Koran? How about the Hebrew Bible? The New Testament? <br/>This is a seminar in which we will slowly and carefully read the core sacred texts of three traditions?Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. At the heart of each of these religious is a Book that is considered holy. It is read and studied and used to justify behavior, especially ethical and moral choices. These texts have been treasured and taught, taken across thousands of years and miles to play a role in our contemporary public life. Typically, these books are only read carefully within their communities. But at the University, we study these texts seriously, thoughtfully and respectfully and pay close attention to their reasons and justifications. We live side by side in a pluralistic American democracy, and we should know what our neighbor holds most dear and finds most true. We will begin to learn by simply reading together and thinking about the reasons of these different Scriptural traditions.

What are the rationales for celibacy in different religious traditions? What makes certain forms of passionate desire dangerous according to religious dictums and others morally good? Is romantic love a universal phenomenon or a product of a particular historical development? <br/><br/>This course examines a range of ways in which celibacy, sexuality, and love figure in religious texts and in the study of religion. The course is broad in scope, both in terms of religious traditions?covering Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian texts?and temporality, including material written before the Common Era up to modern studies of romance and religion. We will devote attention to thinking through the writings of key theorists of religious studies and sexuality studies including Michel Foucault, J. Z. Smith, David Halperin, Janet Gyatso, Wendy Doniger, Anthony Giddens, Charles Lindholm, and more. In this process, recurrent themes will emerge, including rationales for celibate monasticism, religious uses of sexual and/or love imagery, views on desire and homosexuality, and the history of romantic love.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "21", "location": "Allison Residential Comm 1021", "topic": "Religion, Sexuality and Love", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/RELIGION/101-6/34702", "instructor": ["Sarah Hieatt Jacoby"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>", "id": "34702", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
