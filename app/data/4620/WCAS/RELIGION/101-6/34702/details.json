What are the rationales for celibacy in different religious traditions? What makes certain forms of passionate desire dangerous according to religious dictums and others morally good? Is romantic love a universal phenomenon or a product of a particular historical development? <br/><br/>This course examines a range of ways in which celibacy, sexuality, and love figure in religious texts and in the study of religion. The course is broad in scope, both in terms of religious traditions?covering Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian texts?and temporality, including material written before the Common Era up to modern studies of romance and religion. We will devote attention to thinking through the writings of key theorists of religious studies and sexuality studies including Michel Foucault, J. Z. Smith, David Halperin, Janet Gyatso, Wendy Doniger, Anthony Giddens, Charles Lindholm, and more. In this process, recurrent themes will emerge, including rationales for celibate monasticism, religious uses of sexual and/or love imagery, views on desire and homosexuality, and the history of romantic love."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:20 PM (CT)", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
