Throughout our analysis, we will ask how the religious/political binary both helps and hinders our understanding of the function of different ideologies and rituals in the pursuit of political goals. Ultimately, we want to scrutinize the concept of &quot;religious authority&quot; itself. Does religion provide access to unique political resources such that we might theorize the existence of &quot;religious authority&quot; as a specific kind of political power? Does religion play a specific role within political contest such that we can theorize a general relationship between religion and politics at all? We will find that such questions cannot be addressed without examining the history of secularism itself and contemporary debates about the relationship between religion in politics."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "The course counts towards <i>Religion, Law and Politics (RLP)</I> major concentration."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:20 PM (CT)", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
