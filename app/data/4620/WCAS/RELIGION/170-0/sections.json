We may study ideas or people or traditions that are surprising to you. You may encounter worldviews with which you disagree. Be prepared to think with this material. I look forward to hearing and reading how you engage perspectives you may not have encountered before.<br/><br/>This class begins with a brief historical overview of how religion has been studied and what is at stake in studying religion. Part I is an introduction to five of the world's religions. Part II studies themes in the study of religion. During this part of the course, we turn our attention to four contemporary cases of dispute over what religion is, why it matters, and how it affects daily life. Each case study will help us think through a particular theme in Religious Studies: belief, sacred, prayer and ritual, gender. We will analyze the case studies through these terms. After each case study, students will submit a mini-project on the case study?a blog post, an image with analysis, religious service observation, and a series of tweets.

Understand some of the history of the academic study of religion, including how others have defined, classified, and explained religion.<br/>? Develop working knowledge of five of the world's religions, including their central tenets, practices, and contemporary iterations.<br/>? Investigate major themes in Religious Studies through case studies in American religious life.<br/>? Create multiple explanations for how religious practitioners live their religion in daily life."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture: Three 50-minute lectures weekly<br/>"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Exam, finalExam, mid-termWriting assignments"}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/RELIGION/170-0/34703", "instructor": ["Katherine Anne Dugan"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34703", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
