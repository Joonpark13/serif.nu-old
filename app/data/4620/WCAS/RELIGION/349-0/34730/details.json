But it is still very much alive and well. In this course we will read important mystical writers from the mid-20th century to the present in the Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, and Anglican traditions. Some of the questions we will ask include: What is mystical or contemplative prayer? How is it possible to know God by experience in a secular, scientific age? What is the relationship between mystical prayer and political action? And why does mystical thought so often express itself in literary form?"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "mostly discussion with brief lectures"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "journal entries and short papers; creative projects will be possible."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Texts will include Simone Weil, Waiting for God; Teilhard de Chardin, The Divine Milieu; Thomas Merton, New Seeds of Contemplation; Bl.
