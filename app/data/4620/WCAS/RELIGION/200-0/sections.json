[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "One of the largest and most ancient of all religions, ?Hinduism&#146; is actually a family of related traditions. Over the last 6000 years, the Hindu traditions of South Asia have developed an astonishing diversity of rituals, beliefs, and spiritual practices and a pantheon of hundreds of gods and goddesses, from the elephant-headed Ganesha to the fierce goddess K?l?. This course will examine the breadth of the Hindu traditions as they developed over time, highlighting the shared features that make them a family, such as ritual sacrifice (<i>yaj\u00f1a</i>), world renunciation (<i>sa?ny?sa</i>), law (<i>dharma</i>), spiritual discipline (<i>yoga</i>), devotion (<i>bhakti</i>), worship (<i>p?j?</i>), and theology. We will pay particular attention to how these traditions have contributed to the development of modern Hinduism, and students will have the opportunity to engage Hinduism in Chicago. We will explore the great works of Hindu literature, such as the Vedas, the Upani?ads, the <i>Bhagavad G?t?</i>, and the <i>R?m?ya?a</i> as well as other important sources such as art, architecture, anthropology, and film.", "name": "Introduction to Hinduism", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "200-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/RELIGION/200-0/34713", "instructor": ["Mark Richard McClish"], "id": "34713", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
