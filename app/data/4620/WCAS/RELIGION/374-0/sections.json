[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Times of crisis and collective suffering give rise to theological innovation and creative shifts in religious expression as people seek to understand their traditions in light of their experiences. In the wake of the Holocaust, Jews and Christians faced such a need for religious rethinking. In theological terms, they asked: where was God and should we expect God to act in human history? What does this event indicate about God's existence? In human terms, they asked: how do we live as Jews today? As Christians? As human beings? Focusing on theological and literary texts, in this course we will explore how Jews and Christians reshaped their thinking about God and religion in response to the Holocaust and the experience of suffering in the modern world.", "name": "Contemporary Religious Thought", "section": "1", "topic": "God after the Holocaust", "course": "374-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/RELIGION/374-0/34784", "instructor": ["Claire E Sufrin"], "id": "34784", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
