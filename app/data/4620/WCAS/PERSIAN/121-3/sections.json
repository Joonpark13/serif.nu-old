[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This class will build on the second quarter of the sequence, strengthening students' abilities to communicate complex ideas in Persian and engage with authentic Persian language materials. The third quarter of the sequence is organized around stories from the Shahnama. In addition to reading, memorizing, and reciting portions of Ferdowsi's text, we will read modern prose renditions of these stories, watch animations and TV shows based on them, and listen to scholarly interviews. Students will write their own summaries of the stories and analyze their historical, poetic, and ethical significance in a variety of written and oral exercises.", "name": "Persian II", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "121-3", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 1:30PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/PERSIAN/121-3/31428", "instructor": ["Austin Michael O'Malley"], "id": "31428", "subject": "PERSIAN"}]
