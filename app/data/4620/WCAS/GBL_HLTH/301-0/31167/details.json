The course orients students to the skills and sensitivities that must be mastered in order to understand the structural underpinnings and culture-specific interpretations of health and sickness in resource-poor settings. It explores the continuum between health and sickness and emphasizes the contribution of distal, as well as proximal, chronic, as well as acute, factors on health and well-being. Students learn about the major players in international health-the multilateral and bilateral donor communities, Ministries of Health, UN agencies-and understand the key shifts in donor policies towards healthcare delivery as promulgated at Alma Ata, Mexico City, Cairo and Beijing. Students are introduced to the major health problems currently impacting the developing world, and alerted to the importance of employing a population-based vs. a purely clinical approach to solving these health problems."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:00 PM (CT)", "subject": "GBL_HLTH"}]
