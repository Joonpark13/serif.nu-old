[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Your internship enlists you as part of the Chicago workforce. This interdisciplinary course is designed to deepen that experience by exploring the cultural and historical construction of work over the past 150 years, in Chicago especially. Discussions and assignments will prompt you to compare your experience with that of other student-interns, to examine the particularities of your internship site within the city, and to analyze your work this quarter within the history of the modern workplace more broadly understood. The overarching goal of the course is to understand modern labor as a contingent and contextual experience, as a practice conceptualized, produced, and organized over time around changing values and norms. Consequently, our texts?pulled from history, sociology, literature, film, journalism, and beyond?will challenge the standard conception of work as a perfectly natural, taken-for-granted practice. Together, we will study your workplace and the people within it, learn more about the history of your office or industry in the city, and come to an informed perspective on what \"the modern workplace\" is?or could be.", "name": "Modern Workplace Culture", "section": "20", "location": "1813 Hinman", "topic": "", "course": "393-1", "meeting_time": ["Mo 10:00AM - 11:30AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/CFS/393-1/34061", "instructor": ["Alan Joseph Kellner"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34061", "subject": "CFS"}]
