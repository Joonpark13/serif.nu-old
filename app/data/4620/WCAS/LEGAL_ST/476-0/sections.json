We will read foundational texts that examine the relationship between law and society, the social and political context of law, the role of law in social change, and the power asymmetries of law. Students will learn core concepts in the field, including, the myth of rights, legal mobilization, legal consciousness, legal pluralism, legal endogeneity and legal translation. Empirical themes covered will depend on student interests. In addition, we will examine the empirical methods used by law and society scholars.", "name": "Law and Society", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "476-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/LEGAL_ST/476-0/31273", "instructor": ["Heather Alma Schoenfeld"], "id": "31273", "subject": "LEGAL_ST"}]
