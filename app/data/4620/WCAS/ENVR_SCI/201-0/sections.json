Students are expected to complete all assigned reading before class in order to contribute to discussions and required in-class exercises. Lectures will highlight and expand upon the most important topics in the assigned readings, but will not cover every topic covered in readings; likewise, some topics covered in lecture will not be covered in readings. Exams will cover all of the material from both lectures and readings. Therefore, success in this class requires both careful reading of assigned materials AND alert attendance in class."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Textbook: Brian J.

Earth system science and environmental science evolve rapidly as new datasets emerge and Earth's environment continues to change. This means that the 2nd Edition, published in 1999, is very out-of-date on some topics."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "BONUS Opportunities:<br/><br/>IPCC Report - Towards the end of the class, a bonus opportunity will be announced to provide a short paper on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. <br/><br/>Seminars - Select seminars with topics relevant to Environmental Science will offered for your attendance, and then delivery of a summary statement. These will be announced in class as they become available through the various department seminar series. <br/><br/>Write your own examination questions! - You are encouraged to submit examination questions for the quizzes and midterm exams through CANVAS. These will be viewable by the whole class. By engaging with the material and participating in this question development, you may find that you know a good percentage of the testing material.
