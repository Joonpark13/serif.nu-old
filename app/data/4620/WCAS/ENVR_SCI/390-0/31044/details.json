This course builds on Applied GIS by introducing students to more sophisticated methods in raster processing, multi-dimensional data analysis, network analysis, and geostatistics. By working with LiDAR, differential GPS, and remote sensing datasets, student will learn how to optimize visualization and analysis of large geospatial datasets. Students will also learn how to automate their geospatial analysis workflow using Model Builder and Python scripting. These skills will be introduced in the context of exemplar problems in climate science, hydrology, geochemistry, and ecology."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "EARTH / ENVR SCI 390 (Applied GIS) or instructor permission"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "-Construct 3-D visualizations and animations<br/><br/>-Analyze geospatial networks and surfaces<br/><br/>-Quantify geospatial statistics<br/><br/>-Build customized toolboxes and scripts to automate a GIS workflow<br/><br/>-Effectively communicate the results of geospatial analysis"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "The core teaching methods are lectures, supervised laboratory sessions, and mentored independent research. Class sessions last two and half hours and convene twice a week (~0:45 lecture; ~1:45 lab). However, students are expected to commit substantial time outside of class (&gt;5 hours per week) to complete GIS projects and should plan accordingly. Classes strongly build off of each other. As such, completion of work during one week is contingent on completion of work from prior weeks."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "In-class and homework exercises (30 % total); two project reports (20% each); student-designed final poster presentation (30%)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Provided"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:59 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENVR_SCI"}]
