[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this class we will try to catch up with what is currently in the center of discussion in German media (this includes print, TV, and social media). Since the dominant subject of the past month has been the so-called refugee crisis (and this will likely be the case in the near future as well), we will discuss the German and European responses to that crisis in depth. Other topics will be included as well: one will be the presidential elections in the US and, more generally, the picture of America and German-American relations that is presented in the media on that occasion. Furthermore, the upcoming Swiss referendum on an unconditional basic income (&quot;bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen&quot;) for every citizen will likely attract much media attention; it will give us the opportunity to discuss different concepts of social security and the role of the state in Europe and the US. Last but not least, there will be ample room for students' suggestions as well as for current events which are not yet foreseeable.", "name": "German Media", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "307-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/GERMAN/307-0/31161", "instructor": ["Jan   Behrs"], "id": "31161", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
