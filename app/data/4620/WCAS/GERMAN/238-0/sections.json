[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Turn-of-the-Century Vienna: Analyzing Freud<br/><br/>This class will take a look at the life and work of the groundbreaking Viennese psychologist Sigmund Freud from a comparative and interdisciplinary angle. Almost 80 years after his death, Freud`s legacy continues to be controversial: some claim that his theories are no longer relevant in the light of new research, whereas others defend his theories and/or expand upon the implications and influence of his ideas, in the realm not only of psychology, medicine, and neuroscience, but also in the fields of sociology, cultural studies, philosophy, literary studies, criminal justice, queer studies, women`s studies, communications, and many more. What is certain, however, is that, one way or another, Freud`s theories and ideas have marked the world for all time. This class will read fundamental texts from Freud`s body of work in dialogue with texts by Freud's near and distant predecessors and followers, both to situate Freud in his historical and cultural context, and to think through the many different kinds of questions that Freud`s work addresses.", "name": "Turn-of-the-Century Vienna", "section": "20", "topic": "Analyzing Freud", "course": "238-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/GERMAN/238-0/31146", "instructor": ["Erica Suzanne Weitzman"], "id": "31146", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
