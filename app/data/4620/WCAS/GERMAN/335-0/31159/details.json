At least since the 1950s, when so-called guest workers started to arrive, the concepts of &quot;Heimat&quot; (homeland) and being German in general have been liquefied; they have been debated and disputed ever since. From the beginning, literature plays an important role in this process of soul-searching. We will examine fiction, autobiography, poetry, and political and theoretical writings by and about &quot;minority voices&quot; in Germany in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Questions we will explore include: What is the relationship between autobiographical writing and identity? What is a &quot;minority&quot; and how might we conceive of a &quot;minority&quot; literature in a manner that is critical to identitarian claims of ethnicity, religious belief, gender, and class? What is the role played by &quot;minority literature&quot; in Germany, and how has its status changed in the last decades?"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Class participationDiscussionFilms / videosLectureReadings"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendanceClass participationPaper, finalQuizzes"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Class materials will be supplied via Canvas."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:02 PM (CT)", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
