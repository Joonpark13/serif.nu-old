[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The recent wave of immigration has brought new attention to the fact that Germany is not (and has maybe never been) a homogeneous society. At least since the 1950s, when so-called guest workers started to arrive, the concepts of &quot;Heimat&quot; (homeland) and being German in general have been liquefied; they have been debated and disputed ever since. From the beginning, literature plays an important role in this process of soul-searching. We will examine fiction, autobiography, poetry, and political and theoretical writings by and about &quot;minority voices&quot; in Germany in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Questions we will explore include: What is the relationship between autobiographical writing and identity? What is a &quot;minority&quot; and how might we conceive of a &quot;minority&quot; literature in a manner that is critical to identitarian claims of ethnicity, religious belief, gender, and class? What is the role played by &quot;minority literature&quot; in Germany, and how has its status changed in the last decades?", "name": "Minority Voices in Germany", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "335-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/GERMAN/335-0/31159", "instructor": ["Jan   Behrs"], "id": "31159", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
