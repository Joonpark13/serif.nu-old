[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Communicating the Incommunicable: Kant and Sterne<br/><br/>The seminar will be evenly divided between a study of Kant`s Critique of the Power to Judge and Sterne`s Tristram Shandy. In both of these roughly contemporaneous texts, but in very different ways, the question arises of how it is possible to communicate experiences so singular as to be unique, and hence in part incommunicable. Kant`s answer has to do with developing a notion of feeling - pleasure or displeasure - which is the way that singular differences may be shared. This approach has not just aesthetical consequences, but also social and political implications. Some of these can be seen to be at work in Sterne`s novel, Tristram Shandy, in which Tristram - the narrator - recounts how his father and uncle, and indeed almost everyone else, talk past one another, due to what he calls their &quot;hobby horses&quot;. But again, through a certain shared feeling things are communicated that otherwise would remain totally disparate. A similar situation is shown to obtain in the relation of the narration to the reader, where such domestic, familial sympathy does not necessarily exist. Reading Tristram Shandy turns out in this sense to be a practical exercise and experiment in communicating the incommunicable.", "name": "German Literature and Critical Thought 1750-1832", "section": "20", "topic": "Kant and Laurence Sterne", "course": "401-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/GERMAN/401-0/31157", "instructor": ["Samuel   Weber"], "id": "31157", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
