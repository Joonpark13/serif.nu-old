[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "When the 16th-century Catholic friar, Martin Luther, stood up for his convictions before pope and emperor, the history of the West was changed forever. In this course we will study the powerful impact that Luther had on the West, both its history and aspects of its culture. Themes addressed are: the secularization of the modern West, economics, political theology, philosophy of religion (Kant and Hegel), anti-semitism, reason and the will, modern subjectivity, the arts. The course aims to show how religion and theology are related to broader cultural, political, social, and aesthetic issues. Class evaluation is based on quizzes, study guides, class participation, and a written paper.", "name": "Luther and the West", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "272-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/GERMAN/272-0/31165", "instructor": ["Christine M Helmer"], "id": "31165", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
