[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Few women writers are included in standard lists of the major canonical writers of the modern Japanese literary tradition. But especially since the 1960s, women make up a significant proportion of the most interesting contemporary writers. This course introduces a number of these newer creative voices, many of whom have won the major literary prizes in the past several decades. These more recent writers, and other writers from the late 19th and through the 20th centuries, show women meeting-sometimes triumphantly, often with great difficulty-the challenges of a changing social order with its changes in personal relationships between men and women.", "name": "Japanese Literature in Translation", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 102", "topic": "Modern Japanese Women Writers", "course": "271-4", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ASIAN_LC/271-4/32129", "instructor": ["Phyllis I Lyons"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "32129", "subject": "ASIAN_LC"}]
