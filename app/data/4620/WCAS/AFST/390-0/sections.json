Participation Students are expected to participate actively in each class and engage with the comments of their classmates. Bi-Weekly questions: As part of the student's participation grade, I will ask students to send two questions that they want to discuss before each seminar. Students should send these questions to the class list no later than 8 am the morning that the class meets. 2. Critical Review Papers Over the course of the semester, students will write two review papers based on the theme of a particular week. In the first paper, the student will analyze the theories and concepts from a set of readings, looking for assumptions or gaps in the literature (Concept paper). In the second paper, students will examine and critique a methodological approach and/or research design from a set of readings (Methods paper). Papers should be well argued and concise (avoiding summary of readings). Critical Review papers should be 5-6 pages (double-spaced). 3. Research Paper Students will work on developing their research papers over the course of the semester. Papers should present a clear and well-motived research question that addresses themes or debates that we have covered in the class. The paper should also present a clear set of hypotheses and should draw on original data to support hypotheses. They should be 15-20 pages, due the final day of class. 4.
