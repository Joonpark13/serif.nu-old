[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course presents an overview of how archaeology and cultural heritage have been employed for various political agendas in the Middle East since the 19th century. Although it was first introduced to the region as a colonial enterprise by European powers, the discipline of archaeology became a pivotal tool for the local populations of the Middle East to construct new histories and identities during the period of intensive nation building after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. To understand this process, we will first look at the establishment of archaeological practice in the late Ottoman Empire as a foreign and elite practice. Then we will move on to individual case studies in Turkey, Iraq, Egypt, and Israel to understand the role of archaeology and cultural heritage in the formation of these countries as modern nation-states with a shared identity. Finally, we will try to answer questions like &quot;What do pharaohs mean to modern Egyptians? Who suggested that Hittites were the ancestors of Turks? Why do modern Assyrian Christians still celebrate ancient festivals? How do archaeological projects in Israel-Palestine attempt to verify Biblical texts? Why did Saddam Hussein consider himself the last Babylonian king?&quot; The course will also include a field trip to the Oriental Institute Museum of the University to Chicago.", "name": "Advanced Topics in Middle East &amp; North African Studies", "section": "20", "topic": "Archaeology, Cultural Heritage &amp; Politics in the M", "course": "390-4", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/MENA/390-4/38376", "instructor": ["Oya   Topcuoglu"], "id": "38376", "subject": "MENA"}]
