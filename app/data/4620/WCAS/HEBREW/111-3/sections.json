[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is a course in elementary modern Hebrew. The course is designed to develop all four language skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) and an explicit knowledge of Hebrew grammar. Class work centers on learning new vocabulary and grammatical structures. These are introduced and exercised orally in anticipation of dealing with written dialogues and essays. Drills in the texts and on audio files expand and reinforce the new material. Independent lab work is part of the coursework.", "name": "Hebrew I", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 112", "topic": "", "course": "111-3", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeThFr 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HEBREW/111-3/31241", "instructor": ["Edna   Grad"], "class_attributes": "Specific requirements in the language<br/><br/>", "id": "31241", "subject": "HEBREW"}]
