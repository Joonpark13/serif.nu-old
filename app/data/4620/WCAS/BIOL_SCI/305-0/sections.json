[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "A laboratory course giving students hands on experience in the performance and analysis of, and presentation of data from, experiments in the physiology of the nervous system. Topics will be explored in 2-3 multi-week projects. Some of the experiments that are likely to be performed include: intracellular recording of the membrane potential in crayfish muscle; electroretinograms recorded from Drosophila photoreceptors; use of optogenetics to study synaptic plasticity at the neuromuscular junctions of transgenic Drosophila. The animals that may be used for these experiments may include crayfish, Drosophila and humans.", "name": "Neurobiology Laboratory", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "305-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 3:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/305-0/32138", "instructor": ["Tracy M Hodgson"], "id": "32138", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
