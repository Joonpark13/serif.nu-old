[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "A multi-disciplinary approach towards an understanding of the organization and function of the mammalian brain at a systems level. Topics for discussion will include sensory and motor systems, sensorimotor integration, cognition. Time will be devoted to presentation of essential material for each system as well as to a discussion of key experiments that have contributed to our understanding of these systems. As an aid to the comprehension of relationships between structure and function in the central nervous system, one class period will be devoted to the dissection of a sheep's brain.", "name": "Systems &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "306-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/306-0/32140", "instructor": ["Mark   Segraves"], "id": "32140", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
