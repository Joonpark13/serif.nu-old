[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The course deals with the major structural and functional transformations and innovations that characterize the evolution of vertebrates from fish to man. It integrates findings from vertebrate paleontology with the study of living vertebrates, and it includes practical lab work that will offer the opportunity to dissect a shark and/or a bony fish. In order to maintain a phylogenetic perspective and integration with paleontology, the course will start out with a brief introduction into the methods of phylogeny reconstruction. This will be followed by an introduction to vertebrate hard tissues as a basis for an understanding of the musculoskeletal system throughout vertebrates. Highlights are the origin of jawed vertebrates, the transition from water to land and the origin of the tetrapod limb, the diversification of tetrapods and the origin of amniotes, the origin of birds from theropod dinosaurs, endothermy and the evolution of mammals. The final class will put human skeletal anatomy into its evolutionary, i.e., historical, perspective.", "name": "Anatomy of Vertebrates", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "344-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 1:00PM - 3:45PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/344-0/32143", "instructor": ["Olivier Cedric Rieppel"], "id": "32143", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
