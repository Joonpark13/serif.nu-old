[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Spring Flora merges aspects of plant evolution and identification (with an emphasis on learning about the local flora) with plant ecology (with an emphasis on ecological interactions and adaptations). This course takes a field-based approach to learning the process of identifying major components of the local flora. Understanding vegetative and reproductive structures of plants, and use of this knowledge to identify plants with taxonomic keys will be emphasized. Ecological interactions, adaptations, and related conservation issues will also be discussed. This course will take place on the grounds of the Chicago Botanic Garden but some days we will go off site. Be prepared to spend at least part of every class period in the field, rain or shine; warm or cold.
