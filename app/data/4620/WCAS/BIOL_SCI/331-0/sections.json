[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Medicinal plants have a rich history - over 80% of the world's population uses medicines derived from plants for at least part of their healthcare. In this course we will explore Western medicines containing or derived from plant products as well as traditional non-Western (mainly Ayurvedic and Traditional Chinese Medicine) herbal remedies and supplements. For each plant we will examine the function of the active compound(s) in the plant, then the mode of action and efficacy in humans. Lecture and discussion topics will come from a variety of sources, but most commonly from primary literature.", "name": "Medicinal Plants", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "331-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/331-0/32147", "instructor": ["Christina T Russin"], "id": "32147", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
