Therefore, quantitative understanding of the physics and chemistry of the surface and shallow subsurface is important at both human (e.g., natural hazards, water resource availability) and geologic (e.g., mountain building) timescales. This course will introduce the basic principles of climate science and watershed hydrology to enable students to interpret the form and function of hillslopes and river channels. Implications of process-based understanding will be extended to the mountain range scale by examining the pace and pattern of tectonically-driven landscape evolution observed in natural landscapes.
