[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The challenge of sustainability to &quot;meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&quot; has continued to evolve since its initial formulation by the Brundtland Commission in 1987. This course will (i) introduce students to the fundamental concepts of sustainability, (ii) consider the application of these concepts in diverse societal, economic, and cultural settings, and (iii) explore the potential of sustainable development to act as a force for social justice. The core concepts of sustainability - economic vitality, ecological integrity, and social equity - will anchor course content, frame discussions with guest speakers, inform case study reviews, and guide development of student research. To contextualize sustainability challenges, students will track personal consumption of a variety of resources. Readings, discussions, lectures, and writing assignments will address fundamental questions of sustainability: Can humans and a healthy planet coexist? What does sustainability mean in diverse socio-economic settings? Could sustainable development be a viable solution to social injustice? Upon completion of the course students will have gained a greater understanding for the principles behind, challenges of attaining, and potential outcomes of a sustainable society.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "01", "topic": "Sustainability and Social Justice", "course": "102-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/EARTH/102-6/37099", "instructor": ["Daniel Ethan Horton"], "id": "37099", "subject": "EARTH"}]
