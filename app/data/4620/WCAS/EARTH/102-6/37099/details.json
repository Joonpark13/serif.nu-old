This course will (i) introduce students to the fundamental concepts of sustainability, (ii) consider the application of these concepts in diverse societal, economic, and cultural settings, and (iii) explore the potential of sustainable development to act as a force for social justice. The core concepts of sustainability - economic vitality, ecological integrity, and social equity - will anchor course content, frame discussions with guest speakers, inform case study reviews, and guide development of student research. To contextualize sustainability challenges, students will track personal consumption of a variety of resources. Readings, discussions, lectures, and writing assignments will address fundamental questions of sustainability: Can humans and a healthy planet coexist? What does sustainability mean in diverse socio-economic settings? Could sustainable development be a viable solution to social injustice? Upon completion of the course students will have gained a greater understanding for the principles behind, challenges of attaining, and potential outcomes of a sustainable society."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Class discussions led by instructor and students, guest speakers, background lectures, and student presentations."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Grades will be based on writing assignments (with opportunities for revision), resource consumption logs, contribution to discussions, and student presentations."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Reading materials will include a packet of scientific, newspaper and magazine articles, case studies, and web resources."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "EARTH"}]
