The study of Earth materials is fundamental to Earth and environmental sciences and deals with formation, stability, environments, and properties of materials that control large-scale processes from weathering to earthquakes. The physical properties of Earth materials are largely controlled by bonding and crystal structure. This course begins with an atomistic approach to understanding mineral properties, but also extends physical properties and mineral stability to the larger geological and planetary scales. The properties of minerals also dictate how we use them for societal applications, ranging from raw materials to chemical filters and energy sources and storage materials. Mineralogy is the application of physics, chemistry, and biology to natural materials, and this course emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of mineralogy. Students will gain skills in learning to identify the major rock-forming minerals in hand-specimen and in the optical microscope. Students will apply analytical techniques including X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy to quantitative analysis of minerals.", "qtr": "Spring 2016", "name": "Earth and Planetary Materials", "title": "WCAS EARTH 300-0-01 Earth and Planetary Materials", "lmod": "4/3/16 7:54 PM (CT)", "section": "01", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847.467.1825", "instructor_name": "Steven Dollard Jacobsen", "instructor_addr": "Tech F297"}], "associated_classes": [{"component": "LAB", "room": "Technological Institute F391", "meeting_time": "We 10:00AM - 11:50AM"}, {"component": "LAB", "room": "Technological Institute F391", "meeting_time": "We 1:00PM - 2:50PM"}, {"component": "LAB", "room": "Technological Institute F391", "meeting_time": "We 4:00PM - 5:50PM"}], "topic": "", "course": "300-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "The Earth and planets are composed of minerals, rocks, melts, and fluids.
