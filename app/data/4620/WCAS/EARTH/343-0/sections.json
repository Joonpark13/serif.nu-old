[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Earth System Modeling is an introduction to the art and science of reducing Earth's<br/>complex systems into simple numerical models. This course will survey core Earth system science<br/>topics, introduce numerical modeling concepts, and facilitate the construction of dynamical models<br/>in a hands-on computational laboratory environment. Core topics reviewed and modeled include the<br/>rock cycle, hydrological cycle, Earth's climate, and the global carbon cycle. The lecture portion of<br/>the course will highlight/review Earth science concepts, while the modeling component of the course<br/>will focus on the design, construction, and use of models to test hypotheses, and increase<br/>understanding of the forces and processes that shape the global environment. The modeling software<br/>to be used will be appropriate to undergraduates and beginning graduate students who do not have<br/>previous experience with solving differential equations or with computer programming, though<br/>students with these skill sets will appreciate the manifestation of numerical rules in the software<br/>package. Ultimately, this course is designed to empower students with introductory modeling skills<br/>that can be used to build a better understanding of how Earth's various components interact and<br/>evolve.", "name": "Earth System Modeling", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "343-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/EARTH/343-0/38050", "instructor": ["Daniel Ethan Horton"], "id": "38050", "subject": "EARTH"}]
