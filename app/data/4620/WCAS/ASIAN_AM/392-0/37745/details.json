Although the course readings will focus primarily on documentary, historical, and<br/>realist works, students are encouraged to pursue interests in other genres and styles.<br/>The point of departure for our collective readings will be the rhetorical figure of &quot;metastasis&quot; or<br/>displacement. We will examine metastasis not only in formal terms?as the production of narrative<br/>movement through sequences of static images, but also in historical terms?as psychological and physical<br/>displacements wrought by Japanese and Jewish immigration to the United States, Japanese American<br/>internment, and the Holocaust."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendanceClass participation: active<br/>Other: Drawing exercises<br/>Paper, final: * must be turned in to pass the course<br/>Peer assessmentPresentations: Midterm presentation<br/>Research project"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "1.
