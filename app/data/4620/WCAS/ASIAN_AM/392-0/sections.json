[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this seminar, students will develop their own research projects on manga, comics, or graphic<br/>novels while working together through a comparative reading list of Jewish, Japanese, and American<br/>graphic narratives. Although the course readings will focus primarily on documentary, historical, and<br/>realist works, students are encouraged to pursue interests in other genres and styles.<br/>The point of departure for our collective readings will be the rhetorical figure of &quot;metastasis&quot; or<br/>displacement. We will examine metastasis not only in formal terms?as the production of narrative<br/>movement through sequences of static images, but also in historical terms?as psychological and physical<br/>displacements wrought by Japanese and Jewish immigration to the United States, Japanese American<br/>internment, and the Holocaust.", "name": "Seminar in Asian American Studies", "section": "1", "topic": "Manga &amp; The Graphic Novel", "course": "392-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ASIAN_AM/392-0/37745", "instructor": ["Andrew Way Leong"], "id": "37745", "subject": "ASIAN_AM"}]
