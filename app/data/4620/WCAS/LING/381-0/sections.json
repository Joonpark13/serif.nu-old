[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "One of the most important communication skills necessary for a successful academic career is the ability to write effectively in a variety of genres. This course aims to address the needs of nonnative speakers of English in developing their writing skills. We will focus both on the mechanics of English sentences and paragraphs as well as the local and global discourse structure of written texts. A workshop atmosphere is encouraged in the classroom, and online homework assignments encourage students to extend their writing practice into their own fields of expertise and interest. Students will also receive explicit constructive criticism from the instructor on regular electronic submissions. This class is a &quot;hybrid&quot; course, meaning that 50% of the class is conducted online. Rather than meeting for two and a half hours per week, we meet for only one and a quarter hours, and that face-to-face time is spent working on the issues presented in each weekly unit.", "name": "Written English for Non-native Speakers", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "381-0", "meeting_time": ["We 7:00PM - 8:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/LING/381-0/31281", "instructor": ["Julia Margaret Moore", "Kenneth Leon Konopka"], "id": "31281", "subject": "LING"}]
