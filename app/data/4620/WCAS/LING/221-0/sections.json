[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines the linguistic manifestations of prejudice: the ways in which we judge people by the way they speak, how names and labels affect perception, and how prejudice is encoded and enforced in the language we use. Students will analyze the widespread prejudices against the languages/dialects of various groups (based on region, gender, race, ethnicity, social class, sexual orientation, or country of origin). We will also explore the language used to express the prejudices found in our society, from ethnic slurs and other taboo words to gender-biased language.", "name": "Language and Prejudice", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "221-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/LING/221-0/31275", "instructor": ["Erin M.
