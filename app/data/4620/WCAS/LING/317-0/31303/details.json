In this seminar, we will discuss both theoretical and experimental work relevant to this field. Specific topics to be covered include: reference resolution, implicature, the semantic-pragmatics boundary, indirect speech acts, inference, coherence, and figurative language. Students will be expected to read and discuss several chapters and articles each week, and will be evaluated on a combination of class participation, project presentations, and written research reports."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "LING270 or permission of instructor."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "To understand current theoretical issues in pragmatics and to develop experimental tools/methods to investigate those issues empirically."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "DiscussionLectureDiscussion format with occasional lectures."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "PapersWeekly reaction papers and a research paper"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "On-line course packet."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "ATTENDANCE AT FIRST CLASS MANDATORY"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:11 PM (CT)", "subject": "LING"}]
