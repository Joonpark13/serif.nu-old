[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Experimental pragmatics is an approach to the study of language use that combines theories and concepts from linguistic pragmatics and the philosophy of language with the empirical methods of experimental psycholinguistics. In this seminar, we will discuss both theoretical and experimental work relevant to this field. Specific topics to be covered include: reference resolution, implicature, the semantic-pragmatics boundary, indirect speech acts, inference, coherence, and figurative language. Students will be expected to read and discuss several chapters and articles each week, and will be evaluated on a combination of class participation, project presentations, and written research reports.", "name": "Experimental Pragmatics", "section": "20", "location": "2122 Sheridan Rd Classroom 231", "topic": "", "course": "317-0", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 4:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/LING/317-0/31303", "instructor": ["Gregory L Ward", "William S Horton"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "31303", "subject": "LING"}]
