[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this seminar, we will explore the power and complexity of the <br/>human voice as we encounter it in both speech and writing. We will begin by examining the physical and cognitive aspects of speaking and listening. We will then consider how the human voice conveys cultural meanings and how &quot;voice&quot; is expressed in written form. Each student will select a topic of individual interest for a final research project. Topics might include (but are not limited to) the role of intonation in linguistic communication, voice and technology (e.g., telephones), &quot;voice&quot; in social media, voice and music, voice in professional roles, voice and gender, voice and age, voice disorders, the forensic use of &quot;voiceprints,&quot; voice in acting, voice in animal communication, human-machine vocal interaction, variations of voice across languages, accents and voice control in second language learning, the significance of voice in public speaking, and the representation of speech in literature. Throughout the quarter, students will also develop their ability and confidence as writers, and may use this seminar as an opportunity to experiment with their own written voices in a variety of forms.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "21", "topic": "Human Voice, Spoken &amp; Written", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/LING/101-6/31274", "instructor": ["Robert A Gundlach"], "id": "31274", "subject": "LING"}]
