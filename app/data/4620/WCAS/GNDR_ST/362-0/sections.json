[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Our focus will be the homosexuality in drama, and the drama of homosexuality, in Anglo-American theatre and culture, from Christopher Marlowe through Angels in America. Thus, in one sense, the course functions as a version of a traditional &quot;survey&quot; course, treating &quot;gay&quot; male characters, authors, themes, and issues in Anglo-American culture from the Renaissance to the present. But the syllabus is not bound by a survey course's promise of coverage and progressive chronology, and we will also be thinking theoretically about homosexuality's &quot;drama&quot;-that is, the connections in this culture (at least at certain moments, at least in certain contexts) between male homosexuality and the category of &quot;the dramatic.&quot; The course will therefore examine the emergence of &quot;homosexual&quot; and &quot;gay&quot; as historical categories and will analyze the connection between these categories and theatrically related terms like &quot;flamboyance,&quot; &quot;the closet,&quot; &quot;outing,&quot; &quot;gender trouble,&quot; &quot;drag,&quot; &quot;playing,&quot; &quot;camp,&quot; &quot;acts,&quot; &quot;identities,&quot; &quot;identification,&quot; and &quot;performativity.&quot; We will also be interested in the identificatory connections between gay men and particular dramatic genres like opera and the musical.", "name": "Gender, Sexuality, and Drama", "section": "20", "topic": "The Drama of Homosexuality", "course": "362-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/GNDR_ST/362-0/31114", "instructor": ["Jeffrey A Masten"], "id": "31114", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}]
