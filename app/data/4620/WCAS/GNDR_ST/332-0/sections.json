[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, we will draw upon literature in the social sciences and humanities to consider the central role that science (broadly conceived) has played both in categorizing people based upon sexual desires, practices, and identity, and in challenging how we have come to understand those very categories. We then consider how debates over how to define sexuality intersect with struggles for LGBT rights as well as alternative approaches to improving the lives of those who may not fit neatly within established categories. Key topics will include: the pathologization and de-pathologization of homosexuality; same-sex marriage; fixed vs. fluid sexual desire; efforts to change sexual orientation; and the relevance of disputes over the nature of sexuality to trans people's claims to legal recognition, among others.", "name": "Gender, Sexuality, and Health", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute L170", "topic": "Sexuality, Science, and LGBT Rights", "course": "332-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/GNDR_ST/332-0/31110", "instructor": ["Aaron Travis Norton"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "31110", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}]
