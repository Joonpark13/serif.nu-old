Readings will provide a broad survey of the fractious impact of post-structuralist theories since the 1980s and 90s on the urgent vindicationalist scholarship emanating from the women's and gay liberation movements of the 1960s and 70s. Through key monographs and articles, students will examine how historians have negotiated this turn by first understanding how historical research has deepened explanations of oppression and repression. Secondly, by understanding the centrality of differences to historical investigation, we see the crucial role of historical methods in de-stabilizing received binaries and in creating critical distance from normative assumptions. Finally, this course traces how these political commitments of scholars have transformed the archival, interpretative, and narrative practices of the academic discipline in explicating how feminist and queer stances on knowledge have altered historical reasoning and our understandings of the past."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Paper, finalPapersPresentations"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:03 PM (CT)", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}]
