The course will investigate the history of feminist approaches to religious studies as well as new directions in current scholarship including feminist and womanist theologies, goddess feminism, secular and post-secular feminisms, and transnational feminisms. We will consider the following questions: What does it mean to apply a gender studies lens to the study of religion? How do feminist conceptions of \"liberation\" reinforce or reject religious conceptions of \"liberation\"? What are the implications of the \"return of religion\" currently invoked in some feminist discourses? In thinking through these topics, we will read works by Judith Butler, Luce Irigaray, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous, Mary Daly, Saba Mahmood, and Rosi Braidotti, among others. This course seeks to move beyond prevalent assumptions of Judeo-Christian normativity in its analysis of feminist contributions to the study of religion. It pays particular attention to feminist approaches to the study of Asian religions, but with flexibility to highlight other geographic/thematic areas of interest to graduate students enrolled in the course.", "name": "Topics in Gender Studies", "section": "21", "location": "McMillen Crowe Hall 4-138", "topic": "Feminist Theory and the Study of Religion", "course": "490-0", "meeting_time": ["Fr 11:30AM - 2:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/GNDR_ST/490-0/31106", "instructor": ["Sarah Hieatt Jacoby"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31106", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar examines the contributions of historical inquiry to gender analysis and queer critical practices. Readings will provide a broad survey of the fractious impact of post-structuralist theories since the 1980s and 90s on the urgent vindicationalist scholarship emanating from the women's and gay liberation movements of the 1960s and 70s. Through key monographs and articles, students will examine how historians have negotiated this turn by first understanding how historical research has deepened explanations of oppression and repression. Secondly, by understanding the centrality of differences to historical investigation, we see the crucial role of historical methods in de-stabilizing received binaries and in creating critical distance from normative assumptions. Finally, this course traces how these political commitments of scholars have transformed the archival, interpretative, and narrative practices of the academic discipline in explicating how feminist and queer stances on knowledge have altered historical reasoning and our understandings of the past.", "name": "Topics in Gender Studies", "section": "22", "location": "University Library 3622", "topic": "Historical Methods in Gender and Sexuality Studies", "course": "490-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/GNDR_ST/490-0/31107", "instructor": ["Tessie P Liu"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31107", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is an interdisciplinary course, drawing on literatures grounded in contemporary French philosophy and in race, gender and sexuality studies. It considers the contemporary legacy of Michel Foucault in the following domains: critical theory, critical race studies, gender and sexuality studies (with a focus on Achille Mbembe, Wendy Brown, Jos\u00e9 Munoz, Heather Love and Jasbir Puar, Judith Butler, Lee Edelman, and Lauren Berlant). There are three foci of the course: debates concerning the politics of deconstructing and revising Foucault (with a focus on Derrida's critique of Foucault and the concept of hypergenealogy); the emergence of post-Foucauldian biopolitics (foregrounding necropolitics and thanatopolitics, with a focus on Mbembe); and third, contested evaluations of the political role of the future (particularly as seen in critical race theorists and queer theory). In this section, debates include the politics of utopianism, futurism, the anti-social thesis and critique of reproductive futurism, the critique of the latter within critical race studies, Mbembe's analyses of necropolitics and plural temporalities and alternative understandings of plural temporalities to have in feminist theory and queer of color theory.", "name": "Topics in Gender Studies", "section": "23", "location": "Crowe Hall Room 1-140", "topic": "After Focault: Sexuality and the Politics of Time", "course": "490-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/GNDR_ST/490-0/31108", "instructor": ["Penelope L Deutscher"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31108", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}]
