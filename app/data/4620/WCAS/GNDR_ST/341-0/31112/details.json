The majority of the academic works published in the English-speaking world, however, comes from within the Western world and from Western perspectives. At the same time, East Asian men are becoming increasingly visible in mediated forms around the world, in films, print, and online media. This course tries to bridge the lack of academic explorations of East Asian masculinities with the wealth of material available. Together we will explore the construction of masculinities in East Asian cultures, past and present. We will study men and masculinities in pre-modern and contemporary China, Japan, and Korea, respectively, and also in the dynamic interactions between East Asian cultures. We will read and discuss sources that depict fragile scholars, Shaolin monks, ninjas, boys love, and K-pop stars. Our aim will be to enhance our understandings of East Asian identities and cultures as well as Western conceptions of gender and sexuality."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "-Acquisition of knowledge about the study of masculinity in the field of gender studies in general and that of East Asian studies in particular.
