[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this seminar we will examine economic, political, and cultural variations of public goods provision around the world. Who should pay for education and health care? Is social security spending bad for economic development? Is democracy good for the poor? What beliefs lie behind the statist systems of social provision? Addressing these and similar questions in class, students will develop a complex understanding of the issue, which will help them research a real world problem in their final projects. The course puts a strong emphasis on systematic library research performed by the students and gives them a chance to practice various analytic and communication skills: choosing relevant literature and data sources, putting them in dialog, framing the argument, and effectively presenting it to the audience. Final projects and their presentation contribute about 50% to the final course grade; the rest is divided between class participation, topic presentation, library report, and an annotated bibliography for the final project. The seminar assumes that students have completed a substantial portion of the International Studies core curriculum, including the Thematic and Regional clusters before the seminar begins. Students will draw upon their experiences as an International Studies major to integrate their interdisciplinary training with discussions of current world issues.", "name": "Integrating Project Seminar", "section": "20", "topic": "Public Goods in Global Persp", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/INTL_ST/395-0/31239", "instructor": ["Natalia   Forrat"], "id": "31239", "subject": "INTL_ST"}]
