For the past 50 years, U.S. policymakers have struggled to define America's role in an ever more complex world where threats multiply and challenges morph and endure. The period beginning with the Vietnam War traces an arc that reaches from Soviet nuclear arsenals to Islamic suicide bombers, from a fear of falling dominoes in Southeast Asia to hopes for a wave of democracy in the Middle East. This course uses an engaging set of examples and materials to chart one of the most intriguing stretches of international engagement in U.S. History. We will work collaboratively to understand why decisions were made, how policies were implemented and sold, and what it all may mean in the end. Assessing sources from presidential speeches and critics' rejoinders to film documentaries and media accounts, we will study goals and motivations, ends and means in an array of case studies. With the significant added bonus of considering foreign policy as an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign. We will pay particular attention to current events in the Middle East and its surroundings, including Syria, Iran, Israel and Iraq."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:09 PM (CT)", "subject": "INTL_ST"}]
