In this course, we will examine the politics surrounding the delivery of international aid, debating questions such as who gets to decides the aid agenda, which countries should receive what aid and, once delivered, how impact changes political dynamics in recipient communities. The substantive content of this course will expose students to current trends and debates in the world of international aid, highlighting how politics pervades even the most ?technical' of aid interventions.<br/><br/>The course blends traditional seminar-style discussions with the Harvard Business School case method. This teaching method asks students to collectively make a decision in a real-world case involving international aid. The case method highlights to students the complexities (including the many ethical dimensions) of aid work, encouraging students to develop their ability to articulate clear, persuasive arguments and engage in complex negotiations with their classmates in the process.", "name": "Special Topics in International Studies", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 214", "topic": "The Politics of International Aid", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/INTL_ST/390-0/31230", "instructor": ["Martha Anne Wilfahrt"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31230", "subject": "INTL_ST"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "It isn't easy being a superpower.

In this course we examine the international and state response to refugee crisis. In order to understand the responsibilities and challenges of responding to refugee crises today, we will look back historically at the creation of the 1951 Refugee Convention regime. We will learn about how the regime was created in response to the plight of refugees in WWII, the failure to take into account the crises of partition in South Asia and the Middle East leading those states to opt out of the Refugee Convention regime and the implications of this history for today's crises. We will consider the challenges of international and regional cooperation. Drawing on case studies we will critically examine different international responses, the constraints of international and regional cooperation in managing a crisis, the politics of camp and urban refugees, why crises become protracted, populations are rendered stateless and the role of human rights in responding to their predicament.

How<br/>does this help us understand why people organize or fight around issues of land? Second, the course<br/>takes an historical and comparative view of the rules and institutions that shape people's rights and<br/>access to land. The third part of the class explores theories that link land to conflict and violence. We<br/>then apply these theories to explore a set of case studies of land-related conflict: from the recent armed<br/>uprising in Oregon to civil war in Colombia.

The experiences of specific countries in a few world regions will be examined closely.<br/><br/>After the Cold War, the number of democracies in the world increased significantly. In recent years, however, that number has stagnated and even, by some accounts, declined. The global system today is characterized by growing insecurity and uncertainty. The aim of this course is to achieve a deeper understanding of these dynamics and their implications.<br/><br/>The expansion of liberal democracies and liberalized economies was adversely affected by the 9/11 Al Qaeda attack on the World Trade Center and the prolonged wars that followed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. The relentless upsurge in jihadist insurgencies has steadily shifted global priorities to the strengthening of security and political order. <br/><br/>The rise of China and the resurgence of authoritarianism in Russia have contributed to the complexities and uncertainties. So also have the erosion of state systems, forced migrations,and the upsurge in ethnic nationalism and religious sectarianism. The failures of the Arab Spring, and the fracturing of Iraq, Syria, and Libya have had wide ramifications.<br/><br/>Is liberal democracy being eclipsed by new forms of authoritarianism, or is it proving resilient and adaptive? Where are these trends and others evident? Writing in the Journal of Democracy about the \"renewed struggle between democracy and authoritarianism worldwide\", Christopher Walker recently wrote: [Authoritarian] regimes show solidarity and coordination with one another, at least when it comes to contesting and containing democracy and the ideas central to it. Through this more internationalist approach and authoritarian learning, China, Russia, Iran, and other illiberal regimes have developed instruments to counter the democratic West's soft power.\" For these developments in Africa, see an essay by this course instructor: http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2016/01/07-democracy-state-power-africa-joseph.", "name": "Special Topics in International Studies", "section": "24", "location": "Technological Institute LG68", "topic": "Global Democracy and World Disorder", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/INTL_ST/390-0/31234", "instructor": ["Richard A Joseph"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31234", "subject": "INTL_ST"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The seminar is designed for students intending to engage in community-based research with international NGO partners.
