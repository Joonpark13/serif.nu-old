Fiction writers often speak of the importance of writing in \"one's own voice,\" but this is not something that is given to most writers. It is the achievement of a style that requires learning and practice. With models from a variety of writers, including Aleksandar Hemon, Junot D\u00edaz, W.G. Sebald, Julie Otsuka, Marguerite Duras, Claudio Magris, Vladimir Nabokov, and others, we will search for the keys to narrative voice and each writer in the course will explore this element of the craft of writing individually in new short stories.", "name": "The Art of Fiction", "section": "01", "location": "University Library 4770", "topic": "", "course": "301-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:00AM - 10:20AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/WRITING/301-0/30960", "instructor": [""], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>Permission of department<br/><br/>", "id": "30960", "subject": "WRITING"}]
