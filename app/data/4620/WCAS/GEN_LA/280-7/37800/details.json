Students will perform close readings of a survey of contemporary literature and discuss those works' merits and flaws, which is intended to assist and inspire students with their creation of original work to be shared with the class in a typical creative writing workshop setting. The class will be part literary analysis and part typical model creative writing workshop?setting will be the springboard into broader discussion in both cases. </p><br/><p>For the literary analysis portion of the class, we will read and discuss a survey of contemporary literature framed by the use of setting. For instance: imagined settings, such as a dystopic setting via something like Cormack McCarthy's The Road; fantasy/magical realism settings in Kelly Link or Gabriel Garcia Marquez's short stories, or a fairytale setting in Kate Bernheimer's work; realistic settings, such as an often overlooked setting in Clarice Lispector's The Hour of the Star; a travelogue/new territory setting via Teju Cole's Every Day is for the Thief; a reimagining or skewing of the everyday setting through work by George Saunders or Karen Russel; writing within an historical setting; further, we'll consider works with a deliberate lack of setting, such as Samuel Beckett's Malloy or Padgett Powell's Interrogative Mood. We'll also discuss work with illustrations/graphic novels to further explore how visuals affect setting, such as The Life and Times of Richard Onyango or work by Rutu Modan and Guy Delisle. </p><br/><p>Students will then implement the literary devices they've studies by writing original prose, which will be shared with the class for peer review, as well as with the instructor. Discussion of these pieces will include, but not be limited to, the writer's use of setting; however, writing assignments will be influenced by the type of settings we'll have been discussing at the time. Additionally, there will be field research trips to explore unfamiliar spaces, which will serve as writing prompts: these excursions may include a visit to the International Museum of Surgical Science, Belmont Harbor, the Baha'i Temple, the Pullman Historic District, the rooftop garden at Uncommon Ground, and more. </p>"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "After taking this course, students should be able to show they can:<br/><ul><br/><li> Utilize a new vocabulary?that relates specifically to literary devices and embraces an interdisciplinary perspective?to better discuss and understand literature and the craft of creative writing </li><br/><li> Identify the different aspects of setting (time, place, context, etc.) and how these elements contribute to the larger themes and objectives of various pieces of writing </li><br/><li> Provoke students to develop a setting and make decisions about how to convey its elements, and use that setting as a springboard for the construction of a multilayered original piece of fiction or creative nonfiction</li><br/><li> Evaluate and discuss peer writing in a helpful, constructive, and conscientious manner </li><br/><ul>"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "The class will be structured as a seminar."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation (15%).
