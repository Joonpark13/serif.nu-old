Students will be expected to develop their translation skills in prepared passages and in sight-reading exercises. <br/><br/>Elementary Latin provides a basic introduction to the language, literature and culture of the Roman world and helps lay the foundation for further study of western culture, as well as Medieval Latin, Renaissance Latin, and other Romance languages.", "name": "Elementary Latin Classical", "section": "21", "topic": "", "course": "101-3", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeTh 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/LATIN/101-3/37177", "instructor": ["Graziela Marieta Byros"], "id": "37177", "subject": "LATIN"}]
