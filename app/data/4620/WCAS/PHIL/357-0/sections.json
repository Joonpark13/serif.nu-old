In this class, we will try to understand counterfactuals from the intertwined points of view of metaphysics, epistemology, psychology and philosophy of language.

Can we make sense of the idea that, while \"Obama is president\" is a statement about this world, Sally's counterfactual is in some sense a statement about another world?
