Sally's statement is a counterfactual: that is, it is engages us to think about alternate possibilities. In this class, we will try to understand counterfactuals from the intertwined points of view of metaphysics, epistemology, psychology and philosophy of language. We will ask questions like: how does Sally's counterfactual statement differ in meaning from a purely factual statement like \"Obama is president\"? Can we make sense of the idea that, while \"Obama is president\" is a statement about this world, Sally's counterfactual is in some sense a statement about another world? Can we ever know counterfactual statements to be true? And, finally, how do ordinary people reason with counterfactuals?", "name": "Topics in Metaphysics and Epistemology", "section": "20", "location": "Norris Center Big Ten Room 104", "topic": "Counterfactuals and Alternative Possibilities", "course": "357-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/PHIL/357-0/31584", "instructor": ["Fabrizio   Cariani"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31584", "subject": "PHIL"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Suppose Sally says: \"If Obama had not been president, healthcare reform would not have happened before 2016\".
