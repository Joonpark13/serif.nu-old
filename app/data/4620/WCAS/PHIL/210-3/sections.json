[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "History of Philosophy: Early Modern<br/><br/>The transition from the Medieval to the Modern era in philosophy began, roughly, in the late 16th and early 17th centuries and ended, again roughly, in the late 18th century. New methods of acquiring knowledge, along with a radically different conception of the world, permanently transformed the philosophical enterprise. In this course we will examine the views of six of the most important modern philosophers?Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume?on the nature of God, causation, substance, mind, knowledge, and the material world.", "name": "History of Philosophy - Early Modern", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall 107", "topic": "", "course": "210-3", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/PHIL/210-3/31486", "instructor": ["Baron Wayne Reed"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "31486", "subject": "PHIL"}]
