[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is an interdisciplinary course, drawing on literatures grounded in contemporary French philosophy and in race, gender and sexuality studies. It considers the contemporary legacy of Michel Foucault in the following domains: critical theory, critical race studies, gender and sexuality studies (with a focus on Achille Mbembe, Wendy Brown, Jos\u00e9 Munoz, Heather Love and Jasbir Puar, Judith Butler, Lee Edelman, and Lauren Berlant). There are three foci of the course: debates concerning the politics of deconstructing and revising Foucault (with a focus on Derrida's critique of Foucault and the concept of hypergenealogy); the emergence of post-Foucauldian biopolitics (foregrounding necropolitics and thanatopolitics, with a focus on Mbembe); and third, contested evaluations of the political role of the future (particularly as seen in critical race theorists and queer theory). In this section, debates include the politics of utopianism, futurism, the anti-social thesis and critique of reproductive futurism, the critique of the latter within critical race studies, Mbembe's analyses of necropolitics and plural temporalities and alternative understandings of plural temporalities to have in feminist theory and queer of color theory.", "name": "Seminar in  French Philosophy", "section": "20", "topic": "After Focault: Sexuality and the Politics of Time", "course": "415-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/PHIL/415-0/31597", "instructor": ["Penelope L Deutscher"], "id": "31597", "subject": "PHIL"}]
