African-American Philosophy has arguably existed as long as there have been African-Americans. But only comparatively recently, with the growing (though still very small) number of black professional philosophers, has it begun to receive the recognition it deserves. We will begin with some definitional questions and then turn to a conceptual and historical overview that locates African-American Philosophy in the broader category of Africana Philosophy, looking in the process at the work of some pioneering 18th, 19th, and 20th-century figures. We will then move on to an exploration of some of the classic black philosophical themes: identity, racialized experience, social justice."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "By the end of the course, students should have a good sense of some of the central themes of African-American Philosophy."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "DiscussionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Several papers (total of 25 pages for the term)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Lewis R.
