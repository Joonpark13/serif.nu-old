[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This topic is titled \"Environmental Justice: Environmental Protection and Social Equity. This course will begin by examining evidence that there is not equal environmental protection in this country and by analyzing why this inequality exists. Course participants will then review initiatives by activists, regulators and regulated polluters to respond to evidence of environmental injustice, with special attention to the perspectives of grassroots organizations, the U.S. EPA and its state counterparts, and businesses that operate where the problems are most severe. The course will conclude by reviewing the most effective environmental justice strategies to achieve a safe and healthful environment for all, including initiatives emerging from the Obama Administration", "name": "Special Topics in Environmental Policy and Culture", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute LG66", "topic": "Environmental Justice", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["We 3:30PM - 6:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ENVR_POL/390-0/31036", "instructor": ["Keith I Harley"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "31036", "subject": "ENVR_POL"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar will review the history of wilderness in America, both in the broad sense of wilderness as a general term meaning \"pristine\" or \"uninhabited\" nature and in the specific sense of wilderness as the highest level of protection for public lands managed by the federal government. We will consider the role that the concept of wilderness has played in the conservation and environmental movements, and the ways that it both grounds those movements and pushes them in problematic directions, especially as it relates to the underrepresented wilderness experiences of particular social groups. Finally, we will consider the abstract issues of wilderness in terms of specific wilderness areas in the late-twentieth-century United States.", "name": "Special Topics in Environmental Policy and Culture", "section": "22", "location": "Technological Institute LG72", "topic": "Wilderness in American History", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ENVR_POL/390-0/31037", "instructor": ["Keith Mako Woodhouse"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "31037", "subject": "ENVR_POL"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The theme of the \"end of days\" threatens to overwhelm us in popular media; even the United States government is capitalizing on the obsession with the \"zombie\" apocalypse to encourage emergency preparedness. Apocalypses are not just exciting stories, they have long roots in the Western tradition, particularly in Christianity, science, and the Enlightenment, and they have many uses. They can narrate a great victory for the morally righteous, become a foil for a critique of enlightenment or industrial progress, and unveil the gateway to utopia. Apocalyptic stories also often reinforce previously held assumptions about humans, nature, and human nature, holding within them a regenerative moment when humanity (or some select part of it) could finally get things right. As a result, the end of days makes an excellent category of historical analysis.<br/><br/>In this class, we will take a long view on the history of Western apocalypse stories both providential and dystopian. Our guiding query will be always to ask: what work did these narratives do for people in different historical contexts? What can the examination these narratives tell us about history in these various times and places? Our reading will focus heavily on the histories of empire, science, religion, and nature/environment in Europe (particularly Britain) and America. Specific themes will include the link between the revolutionary and the apocalyptic, human and divine agency, limits/scarcity and growth/abundance, utopias, concepts of time, and history.", "name": "Special Topics in Environmental Policy and Culture", "section": "23", "location": "Annenberg Hall G28", "topic": "Apocalypse: Envrn, Hist, Scien", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ENVR_POL/390-0/31038", "instructor": ["Sheila Two Wille"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "31038", "subject": "ENVR_POL"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This class will introduce and cover topics in Ethno-biology which is the scientific study of dynamic relationships among peoples, biota, and environments.

We will then consider social and political responses to environmental problems, paying special attention to grassroots mobilization around environmental justice, organized social movements and expert NGOs working on the politics of the environment, community inaction in the face of toxic risks, and changing patterns of individual consumption.
