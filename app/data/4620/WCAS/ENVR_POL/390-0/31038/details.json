Apocalypses are not just exciting stories, they have long roots in the Western tradition, particularly in Christianity, science, and the Enlightenment, and they have many uses. They can narrate a great victory for the morally righteous, become a foil for a critique of enlightenment or industrial progress, and unveil the gateway to utopia. Apocalyptic stories also often reinforce previously held assumptions about humans, nature, and human nature, holding within them a regenerative moment when humanity (or some select part of it) could finally get things right. As a result, the end of days makes an excellent category of historical analysis.<br/><br/>In this class, we will take a long view on the history of Western apocalypse stories both providential and dystopian. Our guiding query will be always to ask: what work did these narratives do for people in different historical contexts? What can the examination these narratives tell us about history in these various times and places? Our reading will focus heavily on the histories of empire, science, religion, and nature/environment in Europe (particularly Britain) and America. Specific themes will include the link between the revolutionary and the apocalyptic, human and divine agency, limits/scarcity and growth/abundance, utopias, concepts of time, and history."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "EUROPE, AMERICA"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "SEMINAR"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "9-10 PAGE FINAL PAPER BASED ON A MIX OF COURSE CONTENT AND OUTSIDE SOURCES, AN IN CLASS PRESENTATION, AND PARTICIPATION"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "value": "King James Bible (reference and readings)<br/>E.
