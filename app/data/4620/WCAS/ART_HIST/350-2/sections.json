[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "We will study many developments in European art during the second half of the 1800s, a fabled era of innovation, in painting, sculpture, urban transformation, printmaking, photography, and World's Fairs. The course will analyze art in light of a constellation of explanatory factors (&quot;causes&quot;): personal, aesthetic, technical, gender, social, ethnic, political, economic, and institutional. The primary focus will be the foremost vanguards (avant-gardes) of the era, individuals and groups who contested norms and authorities, but we will also consider competing forms of visual culture. Because of the cultural authority of Paris in these years, French art will claim most of our time, but the entanglements of France with cultures and nations beyond France (&quot;the hexagon&quot;) will figure prominently.", "name": "19Th Century Art", "section": "20", "topic": "1848-1900", "course": "350-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ART_HIST/350-2/36695", "instructor": ["Susan Hollis   Clayson"], "id": "36695", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
