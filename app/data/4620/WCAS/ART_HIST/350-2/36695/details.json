The course will analyze art in light of a constellation of explanatory factors (&quot;causes&quot;): personal, aesthetic, technical, gender, social, ethnic, political, economic, and institutional. The primary focus will be the foremost vanguards (avant-gardes) of the era, individuals and groups who contested norms and authorities, but we will also consider competing forms of visual culture. Because of the cultural authority of Paris in these years, French art will claim most of our time, but the entanglements of France with cultures and nations beyond France (&quot;the hexagon&quot;) will figure prominently."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "One take-home midterm exam; several short papers (one based on works in the Art Institute of Chicago); class discussion; and a final exam."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Articles from many sources will be available on CANVAS as pdfs.
