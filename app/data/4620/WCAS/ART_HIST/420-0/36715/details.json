What is an illustrated manuscript? What relationships and dialogues the manuscripts produce? The course discusses the arts of the book in the Islamic lands from the 13th century until the second half of the 16th century in historical and cultural contexts. First, it examines Arabic illustrated manuscripts of scientific texts and of adab literature, and explores their literary and pictorial precedents. Second, it discusses the changes that occurred in the subject-matter and style following the Mongol conquest of Persia and Baghdad in the second half of the 13th century. Emphasis will be given to historical texts, heroic and romantic Persian poetry, and mystical allegories.<br/><br/>A two-day Myers symposium, New Studies in Islamic Painting, will be held at Northwestern University and the Art Institute of Chicago, April 14-15. The symposium addresses the relationship between word and image, questions of patronage and reception, as well as theoretical approaches to the study of Pre-Modern Islamic painting."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Three short written assignments; Class presentation; Final paper."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Weekly readings will be available on Canvas."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
