In the first four weeks we will familiarize ourselves with the broad outlines of the historiography and current debates surrounding cross-cultural art historical studies related to Europe during the medieval period, from the 4th to 15th centuries (although this periodization and geographical scope too will hopefully be questioned by our study). In the second half of the course students will be expected to choose a key location or route (to be selected the first day of class) and prepare short weekly presentations on it in relation to topics such as architecture, portable objects, patrons and artisans: these presentations will be roughly the length of conference panel papers and are intended to help students practice that scholarly genre as well as to give the class as a whole a set of case studies for comparison."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Presentations; Final Research paper"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Janet Abu-Lughoud, Before European Hegemony (Oxford UP, 1991); weekly readings available on Canvas."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
