They include but are not limited to: Perspective; Imagination; Realism; Materials and Media; Iconography; Global Encounters; The Representation of Women; Theory; Art and Science; The Period Eye. Some of the central questions we address include: What did it take and what did it mean to produce a painting-or to work in such other media as fresco, engraving, drawing, sculpture, and architecture in Europe during the early modern period? What and how do such works convey meaning and in what ways have they remained significant over the course of the intervening centuries? Readings, lectures, and discussions will investigate the relationship between art and society. Students may expect to become familiar with works by artists such as Giotto, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo; Caravaggio, Bernini, and Borromini; Martin Schongauer, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Hieronymus Bosch, Pieter Bruegel, Rembrandt van Rijn, Johannes Vermeer, and Nicolas Poussin?among others.
