We begin with Italy and the work of great Renaissance architects such as Bramante, Michelangelo, and Palladio, before turning to the richly varied interpretations of the new classical style in the rest of Europe. We also briefly examine architectural connections to the larger Mediterranean world and colonial Latin America. Themes include: the revival of antiquity, the persistence of the Gothic, architectural theory and professional practice, and buildings as expressions of power and identity"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Midterm and final exam<br/>Two paper assignments (8 pages total)<br/>Participation in class discussion"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Wolfgang Lotz.
