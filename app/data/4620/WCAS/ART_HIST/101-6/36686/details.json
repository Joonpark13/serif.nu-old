And why are the results so strange?<br/><br/>In 1849 a German architect arrived in Galena, Illinois, hoping to establish a practice: and found that no one there had ever heard of any such thing as an architect and had nothing for him to do. But if you go to Galena today, there is plenty of buildings to be seen - many of them older than 1849. What was the problem?<br/><br/>Our modern architecture is something done in certain circumstances using special means - namely, drawings. In fact, it is more about drawing - that is thinking problems through, graphically - than it is about building anything (which is supposed to take care of itself?). And being a matter of drawings, it can embrace both the largest projects - designing whole cities - and the smallest, furniture and decorative patterns. It is one of the great misunderstood and unexplored activities modern civilization indulges in - misunderstood in spite of all it costs when actually materialized and all the discomfort it often then causes.<br/><br/>What are these things - architectural buildings - and why are they so unsuccessful and weird?"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Bio-weekly analytical papers of works of architecture"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Antoine Picon, Digital Culture in Architecture"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
