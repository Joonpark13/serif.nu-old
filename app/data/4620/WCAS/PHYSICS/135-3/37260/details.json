It is intended for science and engineering majors and premedical students. <br/><br/>PHYS 135-3 is the third and final section of the 135 sequence in General Physics. The overarching topic of 135-3 is waves in their various forms and manifestations. Specific topics to be covered are:<br/><br/>-Mechanical waves<br/>-Sound waves<br/>-Electromagnetic waves and their applications in geometric optics<br/>-Interference and diffraction<br/>-Wave-particle duality of quantum physics and its consequences for atomic phenomena.<br/>-Special Theory of Relativity"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites: MATH 220-0, MATH 224-0, and MATH 230-0 or equivalent; MATH 230-0 may be taken concurrently with PHYSICS 135-1.
