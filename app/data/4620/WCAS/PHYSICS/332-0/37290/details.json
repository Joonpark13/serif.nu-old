The goal of the course is to learn how the thermal behavior of macroscopic systems can be understood in terms of the extremely large numbers of their constitutive microscopic parts. Topics to be covered include the statistical interpretation of temperature and entropy; ideal gases, solids and magnets; free energies and the chemical potential; phase transitions; Maxwell, Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein distributions."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "An Introduction to Thermal Physics by Daniel Schroeder"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:16 PM (CT)", "subject": "PHYSICS"}]
