In this seminar, we will discuss both theoretical and experimental work relevant to this field. Specific topics to be covered include: reference resolution, implicature, the semantic-pragmatics boundary, indirect speech acts, inference, coherence, and figurative language. Students will be expected to read and discuss several chapters and articles each week, and will be evaluated on a combination of class participation, project presentations, and written research reports."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:20 PM (CT)", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
