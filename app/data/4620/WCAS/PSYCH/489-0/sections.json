[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "If people did not possess some basic concern for the welfare of others, it would not be possible to develop or sustain the complex societies in which we currently live. However, within these societies, individuals, groups, and corporations often encounter a wide variety of opportunities and temptations to pursue their own personal goals, aspirations, and achievements at the expense of the larger social good. What they determines when people will resist versus five into these temptations? Where do people's concerns for others come from in the first place, and what types of experiences nurture versus suppress these concerns? In this course we will explore such questions by reviewing the decades of research on prosocial behavior performed by economists, evolutionary biologists and social psychologists.", "name": "Topics in Social Psychology", "section": "20", "topic": "Cooperation &amp; Prosocial Behavi", "course": "489-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 11:00AM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/PSYCH/489-0/33476", "instructor": ["Daniel C Molden"], "id": "33476", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
