[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The purpose of this course is to present an overview of the field of psychology. Among the topics we will cover are: history and major themes of psychology; research methods; biological bases of behavior; perception; learning; memory; motivation and emotion; stress and health; social influences on behavior; and psychological disorders. Class lectures, readings, and laboratory experiences will provide you with an introduction to the foundational questions and methods of the science of psychology. The goal of the course is to impart an initial understanding of some fundaments of human nature and behavior, as well as instill a deeper appreciation for the science of psychology. To this end, 10 hours of laboratory experience are required across the quarter to allow you to have first-hand experience of the way research is conducted in psychology. Alternatively, a paper (requiring roughly the same number of hours outside of class) reviewing primary research articles in psychology may be submitted for the laboratory experience. If you are under the age of 18, you must write the paper to satisfy the lab credit.", "name": "Introduction to Psychology", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "110-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/PSYCH/110-0/33450", "instructor": ["Sara Cantonia Broaders"], "id": "33450", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
