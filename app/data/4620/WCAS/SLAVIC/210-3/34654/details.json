In this course, we study texts that confront us with questions such as: What does it mean to live a righteous life? How can one die with dignity? How can we balance the rights of the individual with the needs of the community? What are the proper relations between men and women? Our approach to Tolstoy, Chekhov, and Bunin will synthesize close readings with the study of Russian political and intellectual history. We will analyze philosophical questions raised by our texts, and study how Russian literature reflects historical developments. We will also examine the special dialogue that takes place among these authors, and address problems of genre and narrative, or how the form of a story affects what the author can say."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and discussion section"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Short papers"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Books will be available at Norris Bookstore"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:21 PM (CT)", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
