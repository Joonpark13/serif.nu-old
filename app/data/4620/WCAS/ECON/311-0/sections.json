[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course develops a simple framework for thinking about the determinants of variables like aggregate employment, unemployment, investment, consumption, interest rates, inflation, exchange rates and balance of trade. The framework is used to address issues such as: what is the role of saving in determining the long run wealth of the country; what is the role of money in accounting for inflation; what are the factors accounting for the recurrent fluctuations in employment and output called the business cycle; what factors account for fluctuations in the US dollar; what are the various factors at play in the financial crises, such as those experienced here in the US and other countries; what risks, if any, does the high US government deficits pose for the health of the US economy. The course will examine the various sides to debates about questions like these.", "name": "Macroeconomics", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "311-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ECON/311-0/33290", "instructor": ["Lawrence J Christiano"], "id": "33290", "subject": "ECON"}]
