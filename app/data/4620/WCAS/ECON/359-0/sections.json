[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The nonprofit sector is of major and growing importance in the social service sector, producing a growing share of GDP in the U.S. This course is public-policy oriented, focusing on the roles and efficiency of organizational ownership form, especially private nonprofit organizations, in a fundamentally private enterprise economy. Nonprofits (NPs) are hybrids, combining attributes of private firms and governments. In the U.S., NPs dominate the hospital industry and are major segments of such other industries as higher education (Northwestern is a nonprofit), museums (The Art Institute of Chicago), disaster-emergency services (Red Cross), day care, environmental and species preservation (Sierra Club), and anti-poverty efforts (Goodwill, Salvation Army).<br/> Among the questions examined in this course are: Why is the NP sector growing so rapidly? Why is it more important in the U.S. than in other countries? Why are NPs concentrated in particular industries and totally absent in others? In institutionally-&quot;mixed&quot; industries, how, if at all, does the behavior of NP, for-profit (FP), and governmental organizations differ, and why? How do nonprofits finance themselves? Why does volunteer labor go predominantly to NPs? Why and how does tax policy encourage NPs, and what are the effects of those mechanisms? How should, &quot;good performance&quot; of a NP be (a) defined, (b) measured, and (c) rewarded, and how effective is public policy in encouraging good performance?", "name": "Economics of Nonprofit Organizations", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "359-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ECON/359-0/33338", "instructor": ["Burton Allen   Weisbrod"], "id": "33338", "subject": "ECON"}]
