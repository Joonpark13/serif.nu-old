Students will be introduced to core terminology and modes of analysis for studying the production and distribution of goods and services in the economy. An overarching goal is to gain insight into how, when, and why markets fail or succeed. This includes applying simple models to predict outcomes given particular public policies, as well as understanding the criteria for evaluating such outcomes. Specific topics include gains from trade, supply and demand, elasticity, externalities, costs of production, perfect competition and monopoly."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Econ 201, or confidence applying high school algebra tools (graphs, equations, and tables)"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "A typical week features three lectures and a discussion section."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Midterm exams, weekly problem sets and a final exam."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Microeconomics by Acemoglu, Laibson and List, 1st Edition (ISBN: 978-0133582529)"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:55 PM (CT)", "subject": "ECON"}]
