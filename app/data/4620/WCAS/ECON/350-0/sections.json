In the first section we will use both theory and legal cases to explore practices such as price discrimination, predation, cartelization, horizontal merger, vertical integration, and resale price maintenance, and the antitrust policies designed to reduce any anti-competitive effects from such business practices. In the second section we will analyze economic regulation, looking at the theory and practice of natural monopoly regulation, exploring how regulation affects the decisions and behavior of regulated firms.
