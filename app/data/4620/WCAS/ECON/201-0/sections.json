[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is an introductory course in economics with an emphasis on macroeconomics. The first, more `microeconomic' third of the course will cover general topics such as scarcity, choice, how the market system works and the effects of government intervention. This will take us up to the first midterm. We'll then turn to long-run macroeconomics and consider such things as economic growth, unemployment and perhaps the significance of the US current account deficit. This should take us through to the second midterm. We'll then look at money and inflation. We'll finish with short-run macroeconomics, with a focus on the role of monetary and fiscal policy in stabilizing the business cycle. En route, time permitting, we will consider such contemporary issues as the role of economic policy in addressing environmental concerns and the recent financial crisis.", "name": "Introduction to Macroeconomics", "section": "20", "location": "Fisk Hall 217", "topic": "", "course": "201-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 9:00AM - 9:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ECON/201-0/33228", "instructor": ["Richard E H Walker"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33228", "subject": "ECON"}]
