[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Structured around a quarter-long close reading of Siri Hustvedt's 2014 novel The Blazing World, this course will attend to late 20th century artists who opened new working spaces for themselves by distorting conventions of art. Artists studied will include Louise Bourgeois, Andrea Fraser, Lee Lozano, Lorraine O'Grady, and Elaine Sturtevant. Criss-crossing lines of inquiry based in conceptualism, feminism, and critical theory, these artists evaded easy categorization within the art worlds of their day. Encounters with their works can still be startling, making us consider our experiences of art in unfamiliar ways. In their time, these artists risked apparent incoherence or opacity; in thinking about their projects, we'll try to move outside our discursive comfort zones and take similar risks.<br/><br/>Required texts will include Hustvedt's The Blazing World and Sarah Lehrer-Graiwer's Lee Lozano: Dropout Piece. Additional readings will be distributed in class. The class will also participate in screenings and, possibly, field trips. <br/><br/>Following quote from Mary Ellen Carroll in My Death is Pending, a conversation with Hamza Walker:<br/><br/>\"Distortion\" would be more accurate as a way of describing the operation my work performs on its historical antecedents? And my work does investigate the question of what a conceptual work is and whether that category is still a relevant one. I would argue that it is still relevant, but the more important question is whether it is a category that can be commercially successful.\"", "name": "Art Theory and Practice Seminar", "section": "1", "location": "640 Lincoln St Room 105", "topic": "The Blazing World", "course": "372-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 4:00PM - 6:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ART/372-0/30883", "instructor": ["John Dean Neff"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "30883", "subject": "ART"}]
