It has a ticklish sense of consequence and a blank stare for the concept of property. Such disregard for authority releases sudden ticks, involuntary movement and speech: a-a-a-b-m-ma-ma-ma-ta-ta-ta-ra-ta-ta-ta-zeleni-zub-b-b-b! <br/><br/>This seminar meets Yugoslav post punk and new wave bands, artists, and black wave filmmakers operating in student-run experimentation clubs and organizations. State supported but self-managed, these civic organizations hosted a proliferation of artworks in the late1970 and early 1980's. Through making, reading, listening, composing, scoring and performing the class joins the likes of Daniil Kharms, Elektri?ni Orgazam, Disciplina Ki?me, Laboratorija Zvuka, ?arlo Akrobata, ?elimir ?ilnik, Du?an Makavejev and other non-aligned friends in sucking the blood of entitlement, contentment and cowardice. Disappear them! <br/><br/>This seminar requires no prerequisites or musical ability.<br/>Not for the faint of heart."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "ART"}]
