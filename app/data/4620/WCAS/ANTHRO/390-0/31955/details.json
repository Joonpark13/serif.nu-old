In rural hinterlands, tribal communities use the internet to organize global protests against industrial schemes that will drown and destroy their villages, while farmers commit suicide after crops forced on them by Monsanto fail to yield a profit. How can we grasp the complex processes of globalization in India without resorting to tired tropes of tradition and modernity? With the aid of popular fiction and film as well as scholarly articles and ethnographies, students in this course will consider globalization in India as a historical, economic, and sociocultural process that is transforming the way Indians experience and think about themselves, their cities, their nation, and everyday life."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Readings on Canvas. 1) Adiga, Arvind. 2008.
