Why and for whom do we study the past? Archaeology is performed in a variety of political and economic settings and for a variety of reasons. In this class, we will examine the multiple stakeholders involved in the archaeological enterprise, and the often conflicting demands they place on archaeologists as academics and citizens, with the goal of developing tools and strategies that can improve diversity in the subfield and communication to non-academic groups. We will consider calls for diverse &quot;archaeologies&quot; which incorporate alternate models and experiences of the past, but sometimes challenge our basic notions about the field. We will also consider the responsibilities that archaeologists have to communities, and how we might envision future, collaborative community archaeologies. Finally, we will focus on the different publics at home and abroad that impact and consume archaeological research, and how we might better reach diverse audiences."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "No consent.
