It does so to underline the return, over the past few decades, of the extreme levels of economic inequality in the United States characteristic of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<br/><br/>In this seminar, students will read about, discuss, write about, and thus gain the intellectual tools to evaluate past and present American urban inequalities-including not only class, but race/ethnicity, gender&amp;sexuality, nationality. We will read across several different academic disciplines and journalism to become familiar with key analytic concepts and methods, such as political economy, the Great Compression, urban regimes, ethnography. Using them, we will explore arenas of inequality: employment; urban space, housing, and neighborhoods; schooling, criminal justice, the public sphere."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "We will run as a seminar, with everyone taking part in discussion each meeting."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "There will be 3 writing assignments:<br/>1.
