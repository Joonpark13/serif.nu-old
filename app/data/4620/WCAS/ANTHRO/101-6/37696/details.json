From changes in vehicular design, performance, safety, and style - the world of motor vehicles has grown so popular that is has become a common characteristic of independent modern everyday life. In this course, we look at the history, development, and diversity of 'car cultures' both in the United States and in contexts abroad. Through course readings, films, podcasts, and individual field research exercises, students will be introduced to anthropology and ethnographic research methods. Emphasis will be on the role of objects in social life and developing a critical tool kit - theoretical and methodological - to approach the material world we live in.
