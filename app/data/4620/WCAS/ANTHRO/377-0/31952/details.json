Psychological Anthropology seeks to understand the ways in which cultural and social contexts fundamentally shape psychological processes such as personality, motivation, cognition, and emotion. In this class we will operate from the assumption that explanations of psychological processes must take culture into account, and that adequate conceptions of cultural processes need to address what we know about the general functioning of the human psyche. In this context, we will explore the role of child development, socialization, and language in shaping human psychology, explore several of the main theoretical paradigms dominant in Psychological Anthropology, and finally, examine the interactions of mind and body, culture and mental health, self and narrative, language and emotion."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Course pack.
