Current work has progressively exposed the writer Thucydides as both highly charged and a remarkable literary artist. This in turn has contributed to an increasing unease about Thucydides historical judgments and also his representations of fact. What factors drove Thucydides account? And how far can we reconstruct an independent history of the war?
