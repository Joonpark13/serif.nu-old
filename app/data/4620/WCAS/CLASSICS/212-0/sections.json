[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Rome, a small city-state on the Italian peninsula, grew to rule an empire that stretched from Mesopotamia to Scotland and gave the western world a common culture. Rome's political upheavals set the agenda for subsequent centuries and its military and imperial prowess have always fired the imagination; Latin became the literary language of Virgil and Cicero and later the mark of an educated person; under Rome's rule, philosophy, science and the arts flourished and Christianity began, matured and was spread. Yet we must also remember that the Romans gloried in conquest and that with them slaughter was spectator sport and slavery went unquestioned. Their achievements have informed our world in the most fundamental way and nowhere more than this Republic, whose founders looked to Rome for a model. Lectures and sections will each cover a key event in Roman history or some broader topic in the cultures of Rome and the empire.", "name": "Rome: Culture and Empire", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "212-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/CLASSICS/212-0/37188", "instructor": ["John P F Wynne"], "id": "37188", "subject": "CLASSICS"}]
