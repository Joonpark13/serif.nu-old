This also encompasses the reduction of energy consumption during the aforementioned processes. Green chemistry can be thought to span the life cycle of a chemical product, including its design, manufacture, use, and ultimate disposal. <br/><br/>This class will seek to develop a broad view on green chemistry, with focus on exploring the economic, health and regulatory considerations which make it a multi-billion dollar enterprise. An emphasis on practical real-world scenarios (case studies) that provide us guidance in making better socially conscience decisions will be made. The course can be viewed primarily as being concerned with the philosophy of chemistry as dictated by our modern world in the 21st Century."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: 210-3 and 230-3 or 212-3 (C- or better)."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Matlack, Albert S.; Dicks, Andrew P., Problem-solving exercises in green and sustainable chemistry.
