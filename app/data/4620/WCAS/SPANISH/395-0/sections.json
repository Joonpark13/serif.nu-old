[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Media and Technology in the Andes<br/>The literary representations of photography, cinema, media, means of transportation, and other technologies provide distinct points of view on how modernity has been perceived in the Andes. This course will introduce students to the recognition of those perspectives by looking closely at movies, performances, novels and short stories produced from the 19th century to the present day. We will explore the different ways in which the appropriation of new technologies has changed the nature of Andean cultural production itself: its language, style, narrative structures, the narrator's and characters' worldviews. Texts include contemporary theoretical works on technology and culture, as well as a number of literary texts written by major figures of the Andean region", "name": "Topics in Latin American, Latina and Latino, and/or Iberian Cultures", "section": "22", "topic": "", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/SPANISH/395-0/31817", "instructor": ["Jack Dennis   Martinez Arias"], "id": "31817", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
