We will examine stratification according to race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation and other social categories in the US, and pay particular attention to how these categories intersect to create complex positions of privilege and disadvantage.

We will review different theoretical perspectives on how social inequality is generated and reproduced, and potential social and political responses to these processes.
