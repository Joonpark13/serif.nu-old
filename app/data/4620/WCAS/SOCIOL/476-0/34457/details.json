We will cover topics such as fine-tuning a research idea, formulating research questions, designing a rigorous research plan, navigating the IRB process, recruiting respondents, creating the interview guide, conducting interviews, and analyzing and writing up data. We will also consider reflexivity, ethics, and the complexities of interviewing various populations. Students at all levels of the graduate student process are welcome, but most students find it most helpful to be at or near the proposal stage (for a second-year paper/masters thesis or dissertation project). Each week, participants will spend the first portion of the allotted time discussing course readings and receiving practical instruction from the professor on some aspect of the research process. During the last hour of the class each week, students will gather into work groups to discuss current concerns and receive peer feedback for their individual interview-based research projects."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Active attendance and participation; Midterm research proposal; Peer review memos on midterm research proposals; Final project utilizing interview data"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Robert S.
