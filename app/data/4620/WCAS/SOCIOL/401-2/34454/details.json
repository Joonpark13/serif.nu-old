We will proceed by considering a variety of extensions to the familiar linear regression model. These models are frequently used in quantitative social science and so an understanding of them is valuable in its own right. More importantly, however, our close and practical consideration of modeling strategies for these outcomes is intended to help cultivate an understanding of fundamental principles of statistical inference, data analysis, and modeling that extend beyond any specific set of techniques."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Attendance at first class mandatory"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Long, J.
