[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is a critical sociological look at education in the United States - with a focus on contemporary debates and issues. The course will cover how sociologists have both theoretically and empirically looked at schooling practices, what and how students learn, and how schools fit into the larger society including how the educational system in the US interacts with political, economic, family, and cultural institutions. We will also spend much time focusing on how one's educational experiences and opportunities are shaped by their gender, class, and ethnic/racial statuses. We will focus on K-12 and college with specific topics including college admissions, same-sex schooling, and Teach for America. Throughout all of these issues and topics, we will examine how schools both challenge and support existing systems of inequality.", "name": "School and Society", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "307-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/SOCIOL/307-0/34422", "instructor": ["Karrie A Snyder"], "id": "34422", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
