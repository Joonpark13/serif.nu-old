[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course introduces the relationship between social, cultural, political, and economic forces on the one hand, and legal rules, practices, and outcomes, on the other. We focus on several of the most important sociological questions about law including: 1) What is the purpose of law in a modern society? 2) How is the legal system and legal profession organized? 3) How does politics shape the law? 4) What does the law look like in action? And 5) how can law create or constrain social change? In order to explore these questions, it focuses on a few legal issues in modern U.S. society, including same-sex marriage and discrimination. It also introduces research methods for the study of law and society.", "name": "Law and Society", "section": "20", "location": "Leverone Auditorium Owen Coon", "topic": "", "course": "206-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/SOCIOL/206-0/34411", "instructor": ["Heather Alma Schoenfeld"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34411", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
