[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Key concepts for the analysis of politics in both political sociology and political science include power, the political, citizenship, states, social movements. Typically, these are investigated with reference to social relationships based on class, or, sometimes (especially in the US), race - how do social relations and distributions of power and resources affect political processes, and how, in turn, do politics shape social relations? In this class, we turn the focus to the relationships among gender, politics and policy. We will examine the gendered character of citizenship, political participation and representation, social rights and economic rights. We aim to understand gendered politics and policy from both &quot;top down&quot; and &quot;bottom up&quot; perspectives. What do states do, via citizenship rights and policies, to shape gender relations? How do gender relations influence the nature of policy and citizenship? How has feminism emerged as a radical challenge to the androcentrism and restricted character of the democratic public sphere? We expand on conventional conceptions of political participation and citizenship rights to include the grassroots democratic activism that gave birth to the modern women's movement. We explore how women's political efforts have given rise to the creation of counter-public spheres and alternative visions of democracy, social provision and economic participation, as well as reshaping formal politics and policies. Our main focus is on the US since the late 19th century, and we trace the development of gendered politics and policy since that time, as situated in comparative and global perspective.", "name": "Political Sociology", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "309-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/SOCIOL/309-0/34423", "instructor": ["Ann Shola   Orloff"], "id": "34423", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
