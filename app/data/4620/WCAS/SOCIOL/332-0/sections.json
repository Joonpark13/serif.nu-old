[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The gender division of labor is a key organizing principle in all known societies, but it takes a fascinating array of forms. In industrialized and post-industrial societies, women have taken up paid employment (while still doing the majority of caring and household labor) but men's take-up of traditionally feminine caring labor has been far more limited. Scholars debate about whether and how this will change, and whether political initiatives can influence these arrangements. In this course, we will investigate the ways in which work - paid and unpaid, in families and in places of employment - is organized by gender. We will examine family divisions of labor: how do men and women divide domestic work and care for children? What are the consequences for outcomes in paid employment and in terms of the distribution of time, respect, and power? We will learn about the development of the modern economy and occupational sex segregation, as well as how men and women are treated at work. Finally, we will consider the role of government policy in sustaining or changing these arrangements. By the end of the course, students should understand how gender influences the kinds of work we do and how it is rewarded, as well as how the economy is organized along gendered lines.", "name": "Work and Occupations", "section": "20", "location": "555 Clark B03", "topic": "Work & Occupations: Focus on Gender", "course": "332-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 5:00PM - 6:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/SOCIOL/332-0/34424", "instructor": ["Ann Shola   Orloff"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34424", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
