[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, we will investigate how social conditions come to be defined as social problems. This course will be divided into two sections. The first section will be an overview of how sociologists have approached the study of social problems including theoretical perspectives (symbolic interactionist, conflict, structural-functionalist and constructionist perspectives). In this section, we will also conceptually examine the roles of policymakers, social advocates, and the media in the process of defining social problems. In the second section of the course, we will use the perspectives and conceptual tools from the first part to analyze contemporary social problems including bullying, violence among young people, and the effects of the media on children and teenagers. As a class, we will also examine the debates surrounding several social problems (such as teen pregnancy) to understand how interested parties can define a similar situation as problematic, but do so for very diverse reasons and in doing so suggest very different solutions.", "name": "Social Problems", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "202-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/SOCIOL/202-0/34410", "instructor": ["Karrie A Snyder"], "id": "34410", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
