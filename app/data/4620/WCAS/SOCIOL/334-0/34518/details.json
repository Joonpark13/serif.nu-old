Yet such movements are complex and not well understood. Questions such as why and how are social movements and protests sometime able to generate social change are not easily answered. Indeed, we know little about why some people participate in social movements while others do not. Tactics, social movement organizations, and social movement leadership are not well understood. The purpose of this class is to try and shed light on these questions pertaining to social movements. We will explore these and other questions by analyzing some of the best studies of a variety of social movements."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Preregistration for this course will be restricted to Sociology Majors/Minors. <br/><br/>All students, regardless of major or minor, will be able to register starting February 22."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Please contact the instructor for a list of books."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:22 PM (CT)", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
