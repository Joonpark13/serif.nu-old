We will investigate the ways in which such women negotiate their status and examine the evolving feminist movements that have arisen within traditional religious life. More specifically, we will focus on a case study of feminist activism among Orthodox Jewish women in Israel, in a comparative perspective with Evangelical women and Muslim women in the USA. Some of the central questions we will engage are: how are the forms of feminist identity and activism among women in traditional religious traditions similar? In what ways can feminist activism within religious life be compared with secular feminist activism?"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Open to sociology majors and minors during preregistration.
