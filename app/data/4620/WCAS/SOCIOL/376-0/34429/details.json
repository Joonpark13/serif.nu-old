It studies urban development, economy, social classes and politics in Egypt and Turkey with a focus on two world-historical cities, Cairo and Istanbul. Drawing mostly on readings in history, anthropology and sociology, it examines how urban space in Egypt and Turkey was reconfigured through histories of colonialism, nationalism, developmentalism and globalization with a particular attention to the following topics: urban immigration, informality, gendered places, consumption, urban regeneration, local politics and branding the city. Throughout the course, these topics are studied in relation to two main questions: How do spatial changes engender new social practices and redefine cultural difference and vice versa?; How do power struggles at the intersection of local and global interests shape urban change? The course is designed for history, sociology, anthropology, political science and urban studies majors."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Open to sociology majors and minors during preregistration.
