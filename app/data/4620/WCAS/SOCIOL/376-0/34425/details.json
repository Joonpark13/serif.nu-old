We then consider how debates over how to define sexuality intersect with struggles for LGBT rights as well as alternative approaches to improving the lives of those who may not fit neatly within established categories. Key topics will include: the pathologization and de-pathologization of homosexuality; same-sex marriage; fixed vs. fluid sexual desire; efforts to change sexual orientation; and the relevance of disputes over the nature of sexuality to trans people's claims to legal recognition, among others."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Open to sociology majors and minors &amp; SHC majors during preregistration.
