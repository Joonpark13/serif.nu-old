[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Victor Hugo's Les Mis\u00e9rables (published 1862) was one of the 19th century greatest blockbusters; it was also harshly judged by many French authors and literary critics of Hugo's time. This pattern has lasted for a long time: while serious literary criticism continued to disparage Les Mis\u00e9rables for nearly a century, the huge number of adaptations?not only the musical, but radio plays, films, and graphic novels?and its translation into many languages testify to its continuing popular appeal. In this course we will try to understand both what constitutes the novel's enduring appeal and the ways in which it defies long-established novelistic standards and proposes an unorthodox view of social injustice and social change. We will use the novel's many adaptations in order to illuminate some of the novel's most important features as well as to reflect on the difference between novelistic writing and representation in other media. The discussion of the novel will enable students to better understand the historical specificity of 19th century France while at the same time showing that many of the problems it raises continue to exist in our world. <br/><br/>Taught in English.", "name": "Topics in Comparative Literature", "section": "1", "topic": "Les Miserables: The Novel and Its Adaptions", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/COMP_LIT/390-0/30999", "instructor": ["Michal Peled   Ginsburg"], "id": "30999", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
