[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course explores the interaction between cybernetic technologies and cultural production in modern Japan. We focus on how visual and literary media have been used to represent such technologies (robotics, cybernetics, and the Internet) as well as how these technologies have shaped forms of cultural production in late 20th and early 21st century Japan. The notion of the \"cyber\" - its origins in cybernetics and ensuing proliferation of meanings - forms the conceptual core of the course. After considering early definitions of this term, we turn to how Japanese manga, animation, film, and cultural theory explore the ways in which cybernetic technologies, like cyborgs and cyberspace, have expanded our understanding of human subjectivity and agency, transformed social relations, and blurred boundaries between the human and the animal, the biological and the artificial, and the physical and non-physical.", "name": "Literature and its Others:", "section": "20", "location": "Garrett-Evangelic Seminary 207", "topic": "Cyber-Japan", "course": "375-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/COMP_LIT/375-0/30997", "instructor": ["Patrick James Noonan"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "30997", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course offers students the opportunity to explore some of the many intersections between Shakespearean drama and music from the late sixteenth century through the early twenty-first, not only in many sorts of performance of the plays themselves, but also in opera, ballet, film, musical theatre, art-song, popular music, and the symphony, to name only a few. Textual languages include not only The Bard's original English and its more modern forms, but also French, Italian, Russian, and other modern languages. Given the character and complexity of the material, and the multimedia and interdisciplinary natures of Shakespeare-inspired musical works and scholarship, this course is open to students whose primary interest or field of study is comparative literature, film, English, performance studies, or theatre, as well as any area of music. Because the original productions of all of Shakespeare's plays included music, and each one has inspired many musical interpretations since that time, we will concentrate on three plays and a full range of new works inspired by them.", "name": "Literature and its Others:", "section": "21", "location": "RCMA 1-168", "topic": "Shakespeare & Music", "course": "375-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/COMP_LIT/375-0/30998", "instructor": ["Linda P Austern"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "30998", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Women and violence is a growing topic of interest in our media culture, with entire channels like ID Discovery devoted to marketing true-crime dramas to a mostly female viewership.
