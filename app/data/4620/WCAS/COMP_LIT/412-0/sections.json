Kant's answer has to do with developing a notion of feeling - pleasure or displeasure - which is the way that singular differences may be shared. This approach has not just aesthetical consequences, but also social and political implications.

A similar situation is shown to obtain in the relation of the narration to the reader, where such domestic, familial sympathy does not necessarily exist.
