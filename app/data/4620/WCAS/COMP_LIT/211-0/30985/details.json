What are its roots, and what are its possibilities today? How does it stand in relation to the countless other varieties of rhymed and/or rhythmic language?hymns, pop songs, advertising slogans, campaign mottoes, bumper stickers, and so on?that surround us in our daily life? We will explore these and many other questions by way of examining lyrics past and present, from psalms and hymns to epitaphs, elegies, songs, and love poems. This course will emphasize the varieties of lyric, both in English originals and in translation, with particular attention to the meanings of poetic form and the nature of poetic translation."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
