[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course is designed to teach students all of the basic skills they need to create their own video productions. Students learn to operate cameras and to edit video and complete the course by working with a group to produce their own 3-5 minute short film. All filming for projects will be conducted outside of class meetings. This is a highly technical course; basic knowledge of computers (preferably Mac) is expected. Please note that this course satisfies the media construction requirement for the Radio/Television/Film major (formerly RTVF 180-CN).", "name": "Media Construction", "section": "64", "location": "Fisk Hall B-1", "topic": "", "course": "190-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/RTVF/190-CN/37924", "instructor": ["David Brian Lynch"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37924", "subject": "RTVF"}]
