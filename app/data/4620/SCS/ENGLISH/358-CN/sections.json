[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an introduction to some major works by Charles Dickens, who is arguably England's second greatest writer next to Shakespeare. He came of age as a writer while mass media was being created, and he made use of those communication tools to gain enormous popularity and influence. Some have even called him the world's first literary celebrity. The course examines three novels in the context of Victorian society-its values, tensions, and problems-and the complex relationship between the author and his audience, whom Dickens aimed both to please and to chastise. We will also look at some of Dickens's short essays, published in journals that he edited, which help explain the range of his interests. Texts include the novels Bleak House, Hard Times, and Our Mutual Friend.", "name": "Dickens", "section": "16", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 509", "topic": "", "course": "358-CN", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/ENGLISH/358-CN/37884", "instructor": ["Peter Paul Kaye"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37884", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
