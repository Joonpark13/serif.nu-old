[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Leading global organizations requires understanding, appreciating and managing the impact of culture and the interplay of cultural patterns in everyday interactions. To be successful, leaders must be able to interpret complex cultural contexts and develop intercultural competence, not only in themselves but in the people they lead and other organizations they work with. The course will explore how changes in the global marketplace have created demand for this distinct skill set among leaders so they can be successful with diverse groups of stakeholders.<br/><br/>This course is designed to help students identify and explore the essential elements of a global mindset, going beyond simplistic, \"quick-fix\" solutions by understanding the behaviors, attitudes and emotions that can be confusing and, at times, exasperating if one doesn't understand the impacts of culture. Students will put concepts into practice as they work in teams to develop a unified construct of effective global leadership.<br/><br/>Online, Final Project collaboration will constitute the online requirement for this course.", "name": "Topics in Management:", "section": "19", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 711", "topic": "Global Leadership", "course": "391-CN", "meeting_time": ["Sa 1:00PM - 4:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/ORG_BEH/391-CN/37914", "instructor": ["Charlene   Blockinger"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37914", "subject": "ORG_BEH"}]
