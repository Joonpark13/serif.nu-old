[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Organizational Behavior is an important field of study for anyone who works in an organization at some point in his or her life. Even if you don't plan to be a manager, understanding key principles about how people behave in organizations can help make you a more effective co-worker, team member, and organizational citizen. Organizational behavior is the study of how individuals relate in the workplace, and how group and organizational structures affect individual behavior. This course is organized around these three levels of focus: individuals, groups (or teams), and organizations. We will start at the individual level with topics such as learning, personality, interpersonal perception, values, ethics, and motivation. We will then examine how individuals fit together into groups and teams. Finally, we will discuss organizational culture and structure, and examine how these concepts can influence behavior in the organization. This class will require you to apply your communication, teamwork, critical thinking, and information synthesis skills in many different ways.", "name": "Organization Behavior", "section": "16", "topic": "", "course": "301-CN", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/ORG_BEH/301-CN/37910", "instructor": ["Sidney A Barsuk"], "id": "37910", "subject": "ORG_BEH"}]
