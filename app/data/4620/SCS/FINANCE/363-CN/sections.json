[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "We will investigate the functions and operations of the major types of financial institutions and markets. Special emphasis will be placed on the commercial banking industry. We will look at the major risks that these players face on a daily basis and how they use financial derivatives to minimize those risks.
