[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "One aim of this course is to familiarize students with a wide range of Greek- and Latin-derived terms encountered in scientific and primarily medical fields. Students will gain familiarity with the basic components and an understanding of the underlying principles of word formation. This will include acquiring a basic vocabulary of word roots, prefixes, and suffixes. It will also include analysis of terms, aiming at an understanding of the relationship of their various components. Students will have the opportunity to develop, practice, and reinforce these skills through a variety of in-class exercises, weekly homework assignments, as well as regular tests (weekly quizzes, a midterm and final exam). Once equipped with the knowledge of how such words function, the meaning of previously unapproachable specialized vocabulary may be inferred with reasonable assurance of accuracy, when encountered in context. <br/><br/>Another aim of the course is to acquaint students with the ancient Greek and Roman roots of scientific (specifically medical) inquiry. We will explore the ancients' philosophical ideas and understanding of the workings of the human body and mind and their views on health, healing, and disease patterns and patient care. We will also examine developments in science broadly speaking, and discoveries and advancements in ancient anatomy, physiology, surgery and pharmacology with ramifications for modern science in general, and medicine in particular.", "name": "Scientific Vocabulary through Classical Roots", "section": "62", "location": "Parkes Hall 214", "topic": "", "course": "110-CN", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/CLASSICS/110-CN/37855", "instructor": ["Graziela Marieta Byros"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37855", "subject": "CLASSICS"}]
