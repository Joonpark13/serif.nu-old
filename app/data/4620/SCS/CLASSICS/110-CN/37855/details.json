Students will gain familiarity with the basic components and an understanding of the underlying principles of word formation. This will include acquiring a basic vocabulary of word roots, prefixes, and suffixes. It will also include analysis of terms, aiming at an understanding of the relationship of their various components. Students will have the opportunity to develop, practice, and reinforce these skills through a variety of in-class exercises, weekly homework assignments, as well as regular tests (weekly quizzes, a midterm and final exam). Once equipped with the knowledge of how such words function, the meaning of previously unapproachable specialized vocabulary may be inferred with reasonable assurance of accuracy, when encountered in context. <br/><br/>Another aim of the course is to acquaint students with the ancient Greek and Roman roots of scientific (specifically medical) inquiry. We will explore the ancients' philosophical ideas and understanding of the workings of the human body and mind and their views on health, healing, and disease patterns and patient care. We will also examine developments in science broadly speaking, and discoveries and advancements in ancient anatomy, physiology, surgery and pharmacology with ramifications for modern science in general, and medicine in particular."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "None.

IMPORTANT: Since this is a workbook, please purchase a BRAND NEW 3rd edition, since a used one will likely have chapter exercises already filled in by a previous user - this will put you at a significant disadvantage in your preparation for tests and in practicing the concepts of the course, in general. <br/><br/>2) A good medical dictionary accessible online: I recommend Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary (22nd edition) edited by Clayton L. Thomas (Publisher: F.A. Davis). Taber's 22 (one year subscription) for tablet, smart phone App etc. may be purchased at http://www.tabers.com/tabersonline<br/><br/>Additional class materials (handouts, worksheets, PDFs of lecture slides) will be posted weekly on the CANVAS course site."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "This is not an anatomy/ physiology/ pathology class: all discussions of these areas of knowledge/expertise will be very limited in scope, and this course does not aim at a comprehensive understanding of body systems and medical conditions."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:32 PM (CT)", "subject": "CLASSICS"}]
