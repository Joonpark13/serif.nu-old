[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Far back in the mists of time, the poet Hesiod sanctioned, &quot;if anyone has a fresh grief in his spirit and his troubled heart is parched with sorrow,&quot; when a bard or storyteller then sings a song about the glorious accomplishments of men of old, and about the blessed gods who dwell in Olympus, soon the sorrowful person &quot;forgets his woes, and does not remember any of his burdens, which have been dispelled by this gift of song bestowed by the goddesses&quot;-by the Muses as reminders of the ancient myths. This course presents a tapestry woven of the multicolored strands of mythic story and of song, the fabric of the eternal. Presented in a five-week format (along with others during each academic term), this course meets for five Saturdays from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm: 5/16, 5/23, 5/30, 6/6, 6/13.
