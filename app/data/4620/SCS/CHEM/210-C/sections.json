[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course will continue the study of common functional groups in organic chemistry. Topics include nomenclature, physical properties, characterization, and classic reaction types. Material will shift to strategies of synthesis using condensation, a-Substitution, and pericyclic reactions. Finally, applications in bioorganic and polymer chemistry will be explored.", "name": "Organic Chemistry III", "section": "65", "topic": "", "course": "210-C", "meeting_time": ["We 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/CHEM/210-C/37852", "instructor": ["Owen P Priest"], "id": "37852", "subject": "CHEM"}]
