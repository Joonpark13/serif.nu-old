[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "To succeed in health science related courses students need a mental framework of human biology to which they can add vast amounts of information; without one, students will often &quot;lose the forest in the trees&quot; and end up overwhelmed by information-dumps challenging even for the best of us. Concepts of Biology is designed to show students the big picture. By the end of the course, students will have developed a mental framework of human biology which they will use in all subsequent health science related courses to not only manage copious amounts of new information, but deeply and efficiently learn them as well. We will construct this framework by breaking down a human being into its component parts, focusing on one part at a time. We will also factor in natural selection (&quot;evolution&quot;), how it works, and at what organizational levels of a human being it acts on. The course is represented schematically in Figure 1; throughout the course we will continually refer back to this schematic to ensure concepts are learned within the context of the whole.", "name": "Concepts of Biology", "section": "15", "topic": "", "course": "170-DL", "meeting_time": ["TBA"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/BIOL_SCI/170-DL/37844", "instructor": ["John P Savaryn"], "id": "37844", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
