[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Students will gain an understanding of important topics in Cell Biology. We will discuss<br/>membrane structure and dynamics, cell signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics, cell division cycle,<br/>organelle structure and function, regulation of gene expression and cell-cell communication. A<br/>focus of the course will also be on understanding how experiments are designed and<br/>conducted. Students will gain experience with critical reading of primary scientific literature,<br/>learn the history of major discoveries in Cell Biology, and will be exposed to recent<br/>breakthroughs in modern Cell Biology and Cell Biology techniques.", "name": "Advanced Cell Biology", "section": "64", "topic": "", "course": "315-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/BIOL_SCI/315-CN/37847", "instructor": ["Thomas A Volpe", "Michele M McDonough"], "id": "37847", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
