Why do we go through puberty, and take so long to reach adulthood? Why do women go through menopause, and why do we age and die? These questions reveal the complexities of the human life course and begin to illustrate that we are quite distinct from any other primate. Indeed, the unique way we grow and develop is fundamentally tied to all else that makes us stand out as a species (cooperation, language, technology). In this course, we will explore the basics of the human growth process, the evolutionary history of human development, and the connection between growth and well-being/health.
