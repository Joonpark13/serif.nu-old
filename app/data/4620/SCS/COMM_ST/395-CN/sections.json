In this course, we will attempt to answer this question by studying contemporary and historical media research from a variety of fields, including neurology, social science, philosophy, media studies, and communication studies. Students will participate in group work and self reflection activities intended to help them analyze and evaluate the role that digital media plays in their lives. They will practice using different interpretive strategies and analytical tools to help them determine the social and cultural impact of digital media. We will pay special attention to the influence of digital media on conceptions of self and community, so that we may better understand how digital media affects how we work, play, learn, and communicate with one another.
