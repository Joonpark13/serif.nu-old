[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "How has digital media transformed our sense of self and our relationships with others? In this course, we will attempt to answer this question by studying contemporary and historical media research from a variety of fields, including neurology, social science, philosophy, media studies, and communication studies. Students will participate in group work and self reflection activities intended to help them analyze and evaluate the role that digital media plays in their lives. They will practice using different interpretive strategies and analytical tools to help them determine the social and cultural impact of digital media. We will pay special attention to the influence of digital media on conceptions of self and community, so that we may better understand how digital media affects how we work, play, learn, and communicate with one another. The course is writing and discussion intensive and will require some online discussions in addition to our in-class activities.<br/><br/>This hybrid course combines in-class lecture and discussion on campus with online sessions. Online session dates will be announced in class.", "name": "Special Topics", "section": "62", "location": "405 Church Mansion - 104", "topic": "Digital Media and Society", "course": "395-CN", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/COMM_ST/395-CN/37862", "instructor": ["Mary Morley   Cohen"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37862", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
