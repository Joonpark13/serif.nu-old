[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course will extend the methods of single-variable calculus to functions of many variables, i.e. it will develop techniques to obtain local linear approximations of functions (of multiple variables) in order to analyze and optimize quantities. Specific topics include: vectors, dot and cross products, equations of lines and planes, polar, cylindrical and spherical coordinates, differentiation of vector functions, velocity and acceleration, arc length, parametric surfaces, functions of several variables, partial derivatives, tangent plane and linear approximations, chain rule for partial derivatives, directional derivative and gradient, max-min problems for functions of several variables, Lagrange multipliers.
