[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Building from fundamental physical principles of gravity, light and matter, this course will explore our modern ideas about the solar system, stars, galaxies, and the universe. We will explore two primary themes: the origin and destiny of the universe and the search for life within it. In-class demonstrations will be used to elucidate concepts. The course will include an expert-led trip to the historic Northwestern Dearborn Observatory for night sky observing (weather permitting). This course is designed for non-science majors.", "name": "Highlights of Astronomy", "section": "62", "topic": "", "course": "120-CN", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/ASTRON/120-CN/37842", "instructor": ["Andrew J Rivers"], "id": "37842", "subject": "ASTRON"}]
