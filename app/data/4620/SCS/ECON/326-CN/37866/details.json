By analyzing and comparing the paths countries have taken in their developmental journeys, we identify key economic indicators, decisions, and trade-offs that appear to guide outcomes. We then analyze these outcomes and effects on individuals, corporations, and other actors. We begin by understanding the basic micro- and macro-economic analysis that has guided policymaking, trade arrangements, debt levels, currency decisions, and other major decisions. This allows us to apply tools from basic microeconomic, macroeconomic, and statistics courses and make sure everyone is comfortable at the same basic level of analysis. We then build upon this foundation, exploring in-depth analysis of particular cases and looking at comparative data gathered from a variety of sources. The course also includes explorations of quality of life in developing countries, what concepts like growth and poverty might mean in economic terms, and even a feature-length film."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "While prerequisites are not strictly enforced for this class, they are very much encouraged. Without question, there is some prior coursework that may prove helpful to students. If you have questions after reading this explanation, please contact me via email. <br/><br/>Students should have a working understanding of microeconomic and macroeconomic theory, including introductory coursework in each area. While analytical quantitative coursework beyond descriptive statistics is not required, some work in the course will include concepts drawn from more advanced econometrics, statistics, and mathematical economics. Notation and operations drawn from rudimentary calculus will be used, but the underlying mathematics will be explained in depth where needed."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Students will be able to consider and analyze problems and policies in the developing world within the frameworks of major scholars and scholarship in this area. Students will be able to predict outcomes from proposed macroeconomic policy decisions and able to compare economic decisions to past cases."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture: In my course, lectures and discussion are intertwined.<br/>Readings: I assign 70 pages a week. That's only 10 pages a day.<br/>Problem sets: There is one problem set of four questions.<br/>Class participation: Class participation is central to the course.<br/>Case studies: We look at cases on a country-by-country and policy-by-policy basis.<br/>Writing assignments: There is one optional writing assignment.<br/>Films / videos: There is one required film. And it's a great film. Really, it is.<br/>Discussion: Discussion is central to the course and to the learning experience."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Exam, final: 50% <br/>Exam, mid-term: 30%<br/>Problem sets: 20%<br/>Writing assignments: I assign one optional paper.
