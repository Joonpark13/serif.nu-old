[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course will survey several advanced topics in microeconomic theory, placing a special emphasis in the consumer, managerial, and public policy decisions that result from theoretical analysis. We will begin by introducing the concept of Pareto efficiency, and its relation with the evaluation of social outcomes and social choice. We will also extend the standard consumer choice setup to include situations in which outcomes are uncertain, focusing on investment and insurance decisions. In the second part of the course, we will cover game theory and examine a number of applications, such as optimal pricing strategies by firms acting in an oligopoly. We will also discuss externalities and the ways to solve the problem they impose. Other topics such as information economics may be surveyed if time permits. Evaluation includes problem sets, a midterm, and a final exam.", "name": "Microeconomics II", "section": "14", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 710", "topic": "", "course": "310-B", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/ECON/310-B/37865", "instructor": ["Peter   Sattler"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37865", "subject": "ECON"}]
