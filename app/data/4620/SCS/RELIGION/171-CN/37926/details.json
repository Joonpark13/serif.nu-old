The text and supplementary readings will present doctrine, history, ceremonies and the everyday practices of the vibrant force religion is in the lives of many people and allow us to ask why that is and how it happened. Where did religion come from? Why did traditions develop? What is the difference between spirituality and being religious? This course will explore these questions and the varieties of religious traditions respectfully, even while exploring the increasing political role of religion in many countries. Films will be viewed, and primary readings and active discussion and lecture will allow for interested student involvement. This is not a test-focused course, but will instead focus on short papers and discussion as the basis for grades."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:37 PM (CT)", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
