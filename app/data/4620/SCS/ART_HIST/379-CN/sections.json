[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course will focus upon Chicago's skyscraper history as well as the city's planning efforts. The beginning sessions will study the skyscraper decade by decade from 1872 to the 1930s, broadly exploring building technology, aesthetics, and the social and cultural milieu characteristic of each period. After studying the Plan of Chicago (1909), the class will explore its impact on the city's growth. The final class sessions will focus upon more recent building along Michigan Avenue from Oak Street to Roosevelt Road, will chart the actual development of this important street, and also will consider the spaces formed-consciously or not-around the city's skyscrapers. Field trips will be an integral part of learning.", "name": "Special Topics in Modern Architecture", "section": "17", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 505", "topic": "Chicago Architecture", "course": "379-CN", "meeting_time": ["Sa 9:00AM - 12:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/ART_HIST/379-CN/37841", "instructor": ["Kathleen A Cummings"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37841", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
