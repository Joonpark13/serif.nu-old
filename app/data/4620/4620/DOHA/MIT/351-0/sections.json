[{"school": "DOHA", "overview_of_class": "<p>This advanced introduction to Iranian cinema begins with the first formations of Iranian film culture, long before the 1979 revolution, and continues to the present day. We will follow the careers of award-winning directors, the circulation of films in cinemas and film festivals, and the traditions of Iranian filmmakers working in collaboration with industries based in other locations. We will examine Iran's major films and movements (and some work made in the diaspora) with regard to questions of modernity, gender, globalization, and film's relation to the other arts.</p>", "name": "National Cinema", "section": "70", "location": "Carnegie Mellon Room 3035", "topic": "Iran", "course": "351-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 10:00AM - 11:50AM (AST)"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/DOHA/MIT/351-0/30531", "instructor": ["Kaveh Travis Askari"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "30531", "subject": "MIT"}]
