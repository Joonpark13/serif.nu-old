[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Most of the world's population lives in developing countries, yet the economic realities of these people - and the countries they inhabit - are chronically misunderstood and mischaracterized. By analyzing and comparing the paths countries have taken in their developmental journeys, we identify key economic indicators, decisions, and trade-offs that appear to guide outcomes. We then analyze these outcomes and effects on individuals, corporations, and other actors. We begin by understanding the basic micro- and macro-economic analysis that has guided policymaking, trade arrangements, debt levels, currency decisions, and other major decisions. This allows us to apply tools from basic microeconomic, macroeconomic, and statistics courses and make sure everyone is comfortable at the same basic level of analysis. We then build upon this foundation, exploring in-depth analysis of particular cases and looking at comparative data gathered from a variety of sources. The course also includes explorations of quality of life in developing countries, what concepts like growth and poverty might mean in economic terms, and even a feature-length film.", "name": "Economics of Developing Countries", "section": "12", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 504", "topic": "", "course": "326-CN", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/ECON/326-CN/37866", "instructor": ["Karl Tan Muth"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37866", "subject": "ECON"}]
