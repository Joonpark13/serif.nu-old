The historic 2008 election of President Barack Obama saw the election of America's first African American chief executive and a contest where women candidates in both parties were center stage in both the primary and general elections. Another controversial election was the 2000 battle between George W. Bush and Al Gore. While Bush was ultimately elected, the fallout from the recount and the Supreme Court decision that gave Bush the victory will be felt and studied for years to come. This course will examine presidential races using the 2012, 2008 and 2000 races and the press coverage of the controversies that surrounded them as its central point. We will also explore the coverage of previous races and challenge some of the myths about elections and their outcomes. We will be following the events of the 2016 campaign closely and discuss the latest tactics and developments in the race each week."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:35 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
