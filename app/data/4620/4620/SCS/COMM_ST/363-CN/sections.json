[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course is designed to explore the processes of bargaining and negotiation as theoretical, social, and managerial activities. Special emphasis will be given the areas of interpersonal and intergroup conflict as well as strategic decision-making and its links to negotiating. In addition, interpersonal influence techniques and the tactics and strategies involved with improved bargaining and negotiation will be covered. The major purpose of the course is for each participant to gain insight into his or her own negotiating style and to become a more effective negotiator, as well as a more astute observer of social processes. The course will involve extensive use of cases, role-plays, and related participative activities, enhanced by rigorous self-review and introspection.<br/><br/>Changes in society, the global economy, and ways people work have made negotiating skills more important than ever. The challenges are legion: dealing with history's most diverse work force, doing business with customers who tell you how to run your business, negotiating with foreign counterparts, among other challenges faced in the workplace. These are not just issues of corporate concern; they are also of increasing importance to your personal success.<br/><br/>By participating in this course you will come to recognize the pervasiveness and importance of negotiation. You will acquire a new repertoire of negotiating skills. You will develop a systematic and positive approach to negotiating with colleagues, bosses, clients, other stakeholders, external groups of all kinds, and perhaps even in social situations - in ways that equip you to deal with all manner of conditions and circumstances.", "name": "Bargaining and Negotiation", "section": "19", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 406", "topic": "", "course": "363-CN", "meeting_time": ["Sa 1:00PM - 4:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/COMM_ST/363-CN/37861", "instructor": ["Samuel Robert Tepper"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37861", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
