However, the usefulness of the information obtained from the tests and measures is only as good as the measures employed, i.e., the reliability and validity of the measures. The goals of this course are to develop a strong understanding of how tests are constructed, how to evaluate the quality of tests and measures, and which tests and measures are currently used with a variety of populations (children and adolescents, job applicants, patients) and across different settings (workplace, schools, hospitals, policy formulation). Initially, the course will focus on the history, widespread use and general understanding of the psychological assessment process. We will explore in detail how tests are constructed, how we can evaluate the quality of tests and measures, as well as how to apply these concepts to the assessment of important constructs in psychology (intelligence, personality). Further, we will discuss the application of the assessment process to a variety of different populations, settings and public policy issues.
