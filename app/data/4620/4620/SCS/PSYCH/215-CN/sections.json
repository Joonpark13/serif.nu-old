[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Personality psychology is the study of an individual's characteristic patterns of thought, emotions, and behavior. This course takes a \"theories of personality\" approach. The six major theories of personality that underlie forms of psychotherapy are examined: classical psychoanalysis (Freud), person-centered theory (Carl Rogers), analytical psychology (Jung), cognitive theory, and modern psychodynamic theory. In addition to studying the basics of each theory, we will look at methods of investigation related to that theory and research on the effectiveness of the type of psychotherapy associated with that theory. The emphasis is on finding what of value can be taken from each approach. Teaching is done primarily through lectures in which there will be extensive examples given that illustrate the concepts. Questions and comments from students are encouraged. There will also be small group discussions from time to time.
