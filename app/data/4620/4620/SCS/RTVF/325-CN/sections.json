[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "In this course we will consider the use of cross-dressing and gender bending roles in films, as those conventions are translated cinematically from their origins in theatrical entertainment. From Shakespeare's day, when women were prohibited from acting on stage and men played all women's roles, into the Restoration, when that tradition began to break down, and through the Victorian era, with women portraying young men in music-hall entertainments, cross-dressing has continued to be used for effect on both stage and screen. We will view films from the mid-20th century through the present, evaluating how filmmakers use these methods to define characters and their relationships within the story, whether for comic effect, social statement, or in service of the plot. We will also examine these issues in relation to film censorship and the pre-code era in Hollywood. Films to be viewed include Shakespeare in Love; Stage Beauty; Orlando; Yentl; Albert Nobbs; Some Like it Hot; Victor/Victoria; Tootsie; The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert; Kinky Boots.
