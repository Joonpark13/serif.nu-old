[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course provides an introduction to microbiology with an emphasis on bacteria and viruses and their impact on human health and society. Topics covered include: a) introduction to microbiology including the evolution of microorganisms; b) essentials of bacterial, archaeal, eukaryotic and viruses morphological, physiological and genetic elements; c) the general principles of bacterial growth and control of microorganisms in the environment; d) principles of microbial molecular biology and genetics e) bacterial pathogenesis and current challenges regarding antimicrobial resistance. The purpose of the course is to familiarize students with the essential concepts of microbial evolution and diversity, and explore the relation structure-function to better understand the biology of bacteria and viruses. Students will have an opportunity to explore current topics in microbiology by preparing and presenting a short research talk on a topic of their choosing. This course will also provide an introduction to the primary microbiology literature.", "name": "Microbiology", "section": "16", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 413", "topic": "", "course": "328-CN", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/BIOL_SCI/328-CN/37849", "instructor": ["Dorina   Veliceasa"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37849", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
