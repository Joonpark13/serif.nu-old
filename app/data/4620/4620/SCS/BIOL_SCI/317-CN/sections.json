[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This is a lab course utilizing prosections and demonstrations of human cadavers. It is an advanced anatomy course examining the details of human body systems. Topics include: Body wall and cavities, contents and features of the thorax and abdomen (cardiac, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal systems), pelvis (genito-urinary system), spinal cord and back, innervation and blood supply of the upper and lower limbs, cranial cavities and contents, cranial nerves and blood supply of the head and neck. The majority of the coursework will be done in the cadaver lab, with limited lectures to introduce topics. The lab work will be guided by a lab workbook, handouts and instructor demonstrations. Models, bones (skeletal materials), skulls, and medical images will supplement the cadaver prosections. Lab work will be assessed by the weekly lab assignment, three practical quizzes and a written final exam. A research project will be assigned to allow the student to bridge their knowledge of lab anatomy with more clinical concepts. Students are expected to follow all lab safety guidelines including the cadaver lab dress code; also students should show respect for the cadavers at all times.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Credit for this course is 0.34 units.", "name": "Regional Human Anatomy Lab", "section": "14", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 409", "topic": "", "course": "317-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/SCS/BIOL_SCI/317-CN/37848", "instructor": ["Michael S Mutehart"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37848", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
