[{"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "The flow of migrants away from war, famine and economic hardship is one of the most significant stories of our time. Across the globe, millions of people are on the move, straining the capacity of governments and international relief organizations to cope and ordinary citizens to comprehend. In the United States, France, Germany and much of Europe, the recent flow of humanity from the Middle East, in particular, has become a prominent social and political issue, prompting profound questions about how to respond. This class explores the origins of the current refugee crisis and its ongoing evolution, paying attention to disparate voices and interests. You will polish skills in research/reporting, interviewing and critical thinking as you work toward meaningful final projects in an array of media. Open to graduates and undergraduates, the class is a prerequisite for BSJ students chosen to travel to France or MSJ students chosen to travel to Germany in June 2016.", "name": "Special Topics", "section": "20", "location": "McCormick Foundation Ctr 3107", "topic": "Responses to Crisis: Refugees  2016", "course": "490-0", "meeting_time": ["We 6:00PM - 8:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/JOUR/JOUR/490-0/31370", "instructor": ["Peter D Slevin"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31370", "subject": "JOUR"}, {"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "In this course, you will focus on an important facet of journalism: investigating potentially wrongful convictions. This class isn't about theory; it's about pursuing the truth about real murder cases, interviewing skittish sources in often tough neighborhoods and prisoners serving time?sometimes decades?for crimes they say they didn't commit. You will be introduced to a variety of investigative techniques, interviewing skills, approaches to developing sources and employing public records and databases. Of paramount importance in this class: your safety and adhering to the highest ethical standards in journalism. You are expected to devote a tremendous amount of time in the field?weekdays and weekends?doing real shoe-leather journalism, knocking on doors, digging for information and determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. Keep in mind: Investigative reporting is hard. Expect to confront roadblocks. Anticipate spinning your wheels. There will be frustrations and setbacks. And along the way, hopefully, you will learn to think like an investigative reporter, you will learn by doing and you will do it by the most honorable methods and, so, come closer to discovering the truth?whatever that truth is.
