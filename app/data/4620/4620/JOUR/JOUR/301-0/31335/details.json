But they and their problems?segregation, forced adoption, high rates of poverty, suicide, sexual abuse and alcoholism, low rates of graduation from high school and college?go largely unreported. We will visit the Menominee Nation in Wisconsin, examine our own assumptions and stereotypes (a lecture by the director of the American Indian Center will be titled &quot;Everything You Know About Indians Is Wrong&quot;), undertake in-depth interviews and reporting projects that will help us better understand how to address inequality and injustice in America."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:12 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
