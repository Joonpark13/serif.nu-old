[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "<em>Class Composition</em> <p>An introduction to composition for students of any background. Students are not required to know notation or music theory; instead, we will use verbal and graphical approaches to examine the basic elements of music, i.e., pitch, rhythm, amplitude, timbre, register, density, repetition, variation and contrast, as well as their aesthetic and cultural implications. The course will emphasize critical listening as a way of achieving greater control over the student&#8217s own compositions.</p> <p>Students will be asked to write about music from a variety of styles, traditions, and eras, as well as to create short pieces which will be played and discussed in class.</p>", "name": "Class Composition", "section": "20", "location": "RCMA 1-176", "topic": "", "course": "111-3", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 2:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MUSIC/MUS_COMP/111-3/36380", "instructor": ["Joan Arnau   Pamies Olive"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "36380", "subject": "MUS_COMP"}]
