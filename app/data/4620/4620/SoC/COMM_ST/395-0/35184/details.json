We will examine: (1) family theories that apply to such interactions, (2) family communication patterns that emerge around certain health-related issues, and (3) explore new directions in this new area. The concept of &quot;health&quot; will be broadly interpreted, including physical and psychological health. Topics will include cancer (childhood &amp; adult), genetic disorders, addictions, mental illness and confronting death. The effect of family members' views of illness will be considered through the lenses of age, ethnicity and culture, and religion."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Miller-Day, M.
