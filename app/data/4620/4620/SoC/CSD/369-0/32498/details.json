Major age-related challenges to communication are reviewed, including hearing difficulties, dementing disorders, and aphasia. Attention will be paid to relevant research methods, social perceptions of aging, and the relationship between physical, cognitive, and sensory functioning in later life. As time allows, the psychological and social consequences of communication problems for older adults and their families will be discussed."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:16 PM (CT)", "subject": "CSD"}]
