The class will view and analyze a range of representative films with accompanied readings (e.g. Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now, Terence Davies Trilogy, Lindsay Anderson's The White Bus?, Athina Tsangari's Attenberg, Leos Carax's Holy Motors, Michael Haneke's Code Unknown, Andrea Arnold's Wuthering Heights, Lynne Ramsay's Small Deaths, Chris Marker's Sans Soleil et al), many of which are counter-cultural works which are designed to provoke strong emotional responses, so please review list of sample films above before considering taking the class. Students will then will write and create final short film projects positing their own narrative strategies working either as individuals or in pairs. One short response paper and one director's manifesto will also be completed over the course of the class."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Alternative Scriptwriting: Beyond the Hollywood Formula by Ken Dancyger and Jeff Rush, Focal Press, ISBN-13 978-0240522463 Edition 5 <br/> <br/>Additional PDF readings posted to Canvas."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:23 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
