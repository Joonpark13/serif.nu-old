The primary focus is on the assembly, manipulation, and mix of audio in relationship to moving image, and the clear intentionality of designing sound for moving image. Through demonstrations, in-class workshops, readings, lectures and screenings, students will learn how to work effectively and creatively in any studio or location sound environment.?"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:23 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
