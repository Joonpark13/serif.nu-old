We will explore the ways in which character and plot can be informed, or even determined, by place and time. Students will refine their ideas for an historical narrative and conduct research that will inspire them to write one. We will study examples of historical dramas (from Shakespeare to Downton Abbey) and ask such questions as: why we are drawn to particular historical narratives at particular times? And what the past can tell us about the present?<br/><br/>Readings, lectures, discussion, screenings, and short writing assignments will lead to the development of a final project: a full-length (90 - 120 pages) screenplay or play."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Required texts:<br/>The Kentucky Cycle by Robert Schenkkan<br/>Light Shining in Buckinghamshire by Caryl Churchill<br/>Detroit '67 by Dominique Morisseau"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:23 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
