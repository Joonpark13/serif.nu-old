Each week, through lectures, screenings, readings, discussion, presentations, and critiques of student work, one theme of inspiration will be analyzed. This could include dream, myth, memory, music, math, appropriation, and adaptation. Students will generate weekly projects on these themes by creating prototypes that will include both a written and an image component to be critiqued by the class."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "By the end of the quarter, students should have a strong working knowledge of their own personal voice, an ability to revise and expand their ideas, and to develop them in a systematic way. They should leave class with an understanding of several strategies to draw inspiration from, and specific ways to develop those strategies. They should also be adept at thinking visually and creating iconic images for their ideas, storyboarding these ideas, and disseminating these ideas into a compact, one-page format that gets to the essence of what they are trying to do. Finally, students should be able to identify the underlying structures and inspirational sources of films, and to critique peer work in a heuristic way."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:23 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
