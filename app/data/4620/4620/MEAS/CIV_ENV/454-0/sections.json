[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "This course covers the basic principles of constitutive modeling for soils and rocks, the formulation of their constitutive equations and their implementation of in computational analyses for geotechnical problems. Emphasis will be given to the choice of constitutive laws suitable for specific materials, as well as to the analysis of their advantages and limitations. Specific topics will include: elastic modeling (e.g., linear and non-linear elasticity, elastic anisotropy); hyperelasticity and thermodynamics; plasticity theory; cohesive-frictional laws (Tresca, Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager); critical state theory; Cam-Clay; non-associativity and strain-hardening models; elastoplastic models for granular materials; models for cemented soils and soft rocks; viscoplasticity; and cyclic loading.", "name": "Constitutive Models for Soils", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute F280", "topic": "", "course": "454-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 1:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MEAS/CIV_ENV/454-0/35317", "instructor": ["Giuseppe   Buscarnera"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "35317", "subject": "CIV_ENV"}]
