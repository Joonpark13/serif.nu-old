[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "This class is addressed at graduate students with background in Engineering, Chemistry, and Physics, who want to acquire a working knowledge of key concepts in Biochemistry, Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology. We will read both classical papers and modern literature, drilling down to the essentials hidden behind cryptic acronyms and exotic-sounding techniques. We will primarily work with literature that has relevance to Materials Science, in particular bio-inspired materials, but will also consider suggestions submitted by participants.", "name": "Advanced Special Topics in Material Science", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute LG76", "topic": "Biomineralization", "course": "495-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/MEAS/MAT_SCI/495-0/32923", "instructor": ["Derk   Joester"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "32923", "subject": "MAT_SCI"}]
