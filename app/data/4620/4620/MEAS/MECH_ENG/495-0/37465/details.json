Topics include mechanical/electrical assembly, programming interfaces between an embedded computer (such as a Raspberry PI running Linux) and external sensors/actuators (such as an IMU, camera, or motor controllers), programming and tuning a timing-critical control loop for stable flight, using pre-existing computer vision software for tracking optical targets, and creating a software stack that interacts with low-level code to create a desired high level behavior."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "ME 333 or equivalent experience in mechatronics."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:10 PM (CT)", "subject": "MECH_ENG"}]
