[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines the varieties of audio/visual discourse native to and sustained by the Internet and the World Wide Web. Topics may include memes, selfies, supercuts, animated .gifs, comments, search engines, trolling, casual games, etc. While \"sharing\" and \"connection\" typically rule discussions of what networks do or enable, our aim will be to analyze how web-based genres promote affects that diverge from conventional accounts but nonetheless constitute much of networked life, e.g. boredom, cuteness, disinhibition, etc. We will proceed by pairing readings in critical theory and new media studies alongside artworks. Readings by Kant, Cavell, Ngai, Warner, Cohen, Dibbell, Nakamura, Jagoda, Hansen, Starosielski, Richmond, and others. Artworks to be analyzed include a novel (Dennis Cooper's The Sluts), a film (Frances Stark's My Best Thing), and web-based art and data visualization (Thomson and Craighead's Beacon, Kamvar & Harris' We Feel Fine), and a game (David OReilly's Mountain).", "name": "Humanities Seminar", "section": "1", "location": "University Hall 121", "topic": "Critical Internet Studies", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HUM/395-0/31177", "instructor": ["James Joseph Hodge"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31177", "subject": "HUM"}]
