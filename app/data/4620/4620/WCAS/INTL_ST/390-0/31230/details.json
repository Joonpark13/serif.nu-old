In this course, we will examine the politics surrounding the delivery of international aid, debating questions such as who gets to decides the aid agenda, which countries should receive what aid and, once delivered, how impact changes political dynamics in recipient communities. The substantive content of this course will expose students to current trends and debates in the world of international aid, highlighting how politics pervades even the most ?technical' of aid interventions.<br/><br/>The course blends traditional seminar-style discussions with the Harvard Business School case method. This teaching method asks students to collectively make a decision in a real-world case involving international aid. The case method highlights to students the complexities (including the many ethical dimensions) of aid work, encouraging students to develop their ability to articulate clear, persuasive arguments and engage in complex negotiations with their classmates in the process."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "At the end of the semester, students should be comfortable discussing the many political dimensions of international aid. Crucially, all students should be able to advance a defensible opinion about what they think the goals of international aid should be and the best ways to achieve these goals are. Through their experience with the case method, students should be able to articulate prominent challenges to their view as well as offer a persuasive defense in response."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Case studiesSeminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Midterm - 20%<br/>In-class Case Discussions - 60%<br/>Final Case/Exam - 20%"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Banerjee, A. and E.
