[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Recent advances in human ancestry and clinical medicine have underscored the importance of genetic principles. Genetic Analysis will explore the logic and methods of transmission and regulatory genetics, including complementation, recombination, genetic modifiers, chromosomal aberrations, genetic screens and the \"genetic toolbox\" of diverse species. Additionally, we will discuss genome-wide association studies, linkage analysis, and the roles of rare and common variation as they relate to human genetics. Lectures will be provided, but emphasis will be placed on problem solving and active discussion.", "name": "Genetic Analysis", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute LG68", "topic": "", "course": "393-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/393-0/32182", "instructor": ["Erik Christian Andersen"], "class_attributes": "Natural Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "32182", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
