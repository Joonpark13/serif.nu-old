We will read foundational texts that examine the relationship between law and society, the social and political context of law, the role of law in social change, and the power asymmetries of law. Students will learn core concepts in the field, including, the myth of rights, legal mobilization, legal consciousness, legal pluralism, legal endogeneity and legal translation. Empirical themes covered will depend on student interests. In addition, we will examine the empirical methods used by law and society scholars."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Graduate students"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Participation, final paper"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Kitty Calavita, Invitation to Law &amp; Society: An Introduction to the Study of Real<br/>Law (University of Chicago Press, 2010), ISBN-10: 0226089975 <br/><br/>Stuart Scheingold (2004 [1974]) The Politics of Rights: Lawyers, Public Policy and Political Change, 2nd ed.
