[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will examine the general properties of sleep and circadian rhythms and will analyze how sleep and the circadian clock regulate a number of diverse activities at the level of the cell, the organ, as well as the organism. Special emphasis will be placed on the neural and genetic basis for the generation of sleep and circadian rhythms. The importance of sleep and biological rhythms for human health and disease will be covered in this course mainly through a series of student presentations. Much of this course will involve the analysis and discussion of classic, as well as recent experiments, that have been carried out on the study of biological clocks and sleep.", "name": "Neurobiology of Biological Clocks", "section": "1", "location": "Frances Searle Building 2370", "topic": "", "course": "324-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/NEUROSCI/324-0/31458", "instructor": ["Fred W Turek"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31458", "subject": "NEUROSCI"}]
