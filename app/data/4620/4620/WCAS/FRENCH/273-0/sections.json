[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will introduce students to the close reading and analysis of French poetry, from the Middle Ages to the present. We will discuss the evolution of various forms, genres, themes and strategies within their historical contexts and with a focus on several different eras when poetry flourished in France. Examples of forms and genres include Lais, Sonnets, Epic poetry, romance, lyric forms, prose poetry and contemporary hip-hop. This course will additionally incorporate creative elements. We will also explore poetry's relationship with other art forms, music and painting in particular. When and how do poetry and music intersect? How are painting and poetry imagined as 'sister arts,' as some critics have claimed? The seminar format will emphasize student participation in class discussion.", "name": "Introducing French Poetry", "section": "20", "location": "University Library 4722", "topic": "", "course": "273-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 2:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/FRENCH/273-0/31100", "instructor": ["Brett Russell Brehm"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31100", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
