[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will focus on some major works and important genres of literature produced during the 17th and 18th centuries: we will read three plays, a short novel, and a philosophical essay, with a view to understanding the development of literary forms and ideas from the 17th century to the Enlightenment. A particular focus will be the critique of the social model based on a refined court culture in the 17th century and the gradual evolution of society towards a more open, egalitarian culture in the 18th century. In addition we will read short excerpts from other major authors of the period, and short modern descriptions of court society.", "name": "Classicism and Enlightenment", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 118", "topic": "", "course": "312-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/FRENCH/312-0/31065", "instructor": ["Sylvie   Romanowski"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "31065", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
