[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course traces images of violence through 16th-century French literature, paying close attention to the transmigration of imagery, stylistic devices and discursive postures across literary forms. We will examine structural and formal conventions as well as historical and political contexts in exploring the conversations between our texts and the turbulent times in which they were created. Authors will include Joachim du Bellay, Marguerite de Navarre, Agrippa d'Aubign\u00e9, Michel de Montaigne, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais and others.<br/>**Please note: classes will be conducted in English. Reading knowledge of French is suggested.**", "name": "Studies in the 16Th Century", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 118", "topic": "Violence & Form", "course": "420-0", "meeting_time": ["We 3:30PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/FRENCH/420-0/31068", "instructor": ["Cynthia Nyree Nazarian"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31068", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
