[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Having begun in India some 2500 years ago, Buddhism now exists in almost all parts of the world. The Buddhist religion has shaped the thought and culture of Asia and has also influenced Western thought and culture in significant ways. To comprehend this diverse religion, this course approaches it from several perspectives: the historical, cultural, philosophical and religious. In the short time that we have in this quarter, our primary emphasis will be on investigating the philosophical and religious systems in the teachings of the Buddha in India as well as the thought of the later Buddhists in other parts of Asia. In looking at both the history and the philosophy, we see Buddhism as a religion that established a system of values, an interpretation of existence and a pattern of cultural practices and rituals that the Buddhists have interpreted in various ways to find meaning in life.", "name": "Introduction to Buddhism", "section": "20", "location": "Fisk Hall 217", "topic": "", "course": "210-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 12:00PM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/RELIGION/210-0/34717", "instructor": ["George D Bond"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34717", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
