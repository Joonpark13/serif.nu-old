[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course deals with the particular ways in which historical events and cultural transformations of the 19th and 20th century affected both the content and the method of Christian theology. Among these are the development of historical criticism; democratization; world war; and justice movements organized around race, culture, class, and gender. Views of sin and salvation, incarnation and redemption, and knowledge of God figure very differently in this period than the preceding ones. We will learn how representative modern and contemporary Western theologians have dealt with these issues. We will also discuss how they have responded to the pressures of intellectual, political, and cultural movements on theology.", "name": "Christian Thought in Global Perspective", "section": "20", "location": "University Library 3670", "topic": "", "course": "377-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/RELIGION/377-0/34785", "instructor": ["Katherine Anne Dugan"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34785", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
