We are all advancing constantly toward our own death, and almost all of us, at one point or another, are confronted with the death of a loved one. Nevertheless, death is a remarkably silenced topic in our culture, mostly hidden from the public eye and barely receiving serious consideration in contemporary culture. This has not always been the case, and is not the case everywhere: in the ancient world &quot;learning how to die&quot; was perhaps the most important aspect of one&#39;s life goals, and in various societies processes of burial, accompaniment of the dead, and mourning still constitute a fundamental part of one&#39;s social and communal life. The purpose of this class is threefold: first, to get acquainted with some of the most interesting and influential ideas in the history of human civilization, by using the theme of death as a guiding compass. Second, to understand and appreciate the incredible diversity of human experiences and approaches across times and places, and thereby develop greater cultural sensitivity. And third, to acquire a kit of intellectual and conceptual tools to help us better understand our own death and the death of others as an inescapable part of life, and to utilize this understanding toward the development of deeper compassion and greater ethical consciousness."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Receive permission number from instructor."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Class participationDiscussionReadingsSeminar: Once a week for 120 minutes<br/>Writing assignments: Short response papers and a final paper<br/><ln/>"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendanceClass participation: 20% of grade<br/>Paper, final: 35% of grade (10-15 pages)<br/>Readings: Written responses to readings - 45% of grade (3-4 pages each)<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "?
