In our investigation of hip hop as literature, we will analyze how hip hop artists engage and reimagine traditional genres of poetry (ode, epic, and elegy) as well as how they have helped engender new ones (such as slam poetry). This aspect of the class will familiarize students with some of the aspects of prosody through such forms as slant rhymes, internal rhymes, and terza rima, among others. In our discussions of the migratory dynamics of hip hop, we will explore these routings (from the &quot;streets&quot; to Wall Street, from the Bronx to the suburbs, from the U.S. to the rest of the world) in relation to the idea of cultural currency."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation, including one group presentation (30%); two shorter papers of 4-5 pages (40%); and one longer research paper of 6-7 pages (30%)."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Bradley, The Anthology of Ra; Forman and Neal, That's the Joint; Greene et al., The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:57 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
