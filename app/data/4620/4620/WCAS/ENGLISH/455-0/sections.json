[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this seminar, we will explore literary manifestations of a few aspects of the religious mentality of Victorian and pre-Victorian Britain, focusing on the paradoxical historical destiny of a country that was notable both for its tremendously strong current of Christian devotion and for the seemingly irreversible collapse of Christian devotion that it underwent. The constraints of the quarter system in relation to the multifariousness of religious experience in nineteenth-century Britain make drastic selectivity necessary in constructing a seminar syllabus on this topic. Bowing to this necessity, we will take as the central theme of the seminar the influence of the Evangelical Revival (c. 1739-1830) on Victorian sensibility; to gain insight into the deep structures of Evangelicalism, we will devote substantial time to some of the eighteenth-century founding texts of this culturally transformative movement. We will stress also, as the negative counterpart (or perhaps as the perverse fulfillment) of Evangelicalism, various iterations of the distinctively Victorian crisis of the loss of faith.", "name": "Studies in Victorian Literature", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 318", "topic": "Victorian Religious Experience", "course": "455-0", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ENGLISH/455-0/34972", "instructor": ["Christopher   Herbert"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34972", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
