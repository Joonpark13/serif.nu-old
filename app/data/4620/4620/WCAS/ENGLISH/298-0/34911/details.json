You'll learn about critical movements?psychoanalysis, Marxism, feminism, and post-structuralism or deconstruction?by testing their substantive and methodological claims against poems, novels, plots, images, and fictions. As the class proceeds, you'll be able to mix and match critical and literary texts to experiment with the kinds of interpretations and arguments their conjunctions make possible. How do entities like history, class struggle, the unconscious, manifest versus latent content, patriarchy, the body, sex, gender, signification, and textuality continue to engender literary meaning and galvanize the claims we make for the poems and novels we read?<br/><br/>We'll pair Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto and William Blake's Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience; Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; William Wordsworth's Lyrical Ballads and key essays in Jacques Derrida's theory of deconstruction; and Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex. There will be short supplemental critical or historical materials to flesh out some of these methodologies and provide context for the literary texts. Again, you'll be encouraged to recombine authors and approaches as we proceed. A central aim of this class will be to facilitate your appreciation of not only the substantive claims made by Marx, Freud, Derrida, and Beauvoir, but also the methodological possibilities that their challenging worldviews open for the interpretation of literature. At the same time, we'll appreciate that Blake, Shelley, Wordsworth, and Austen are also critical thinkers: indeed, perhaps their poetic and fictional texts anticipate the methodological and historical provocations offered by Marx and the rest. As we gain facility with some of the dominant methodological strands of literary analysis, we'll think about their historical roots in the Romantic era and ponder the still urgent critical possibilities they open for us today."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar-style discussion."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Prerequisites: One quarter of 210 or 270 or permission of DUS.<br/><br/>Notes: English 298 is an English Literature major and minor requirement.
