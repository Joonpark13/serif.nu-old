[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will give students a basic grounding in the class of statistical techniques known as multilevel modeling (MLM). MLM goes by other names as well, such as hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), mixed models, random coefficient modeling, and random effects models. These techniques have been applied to many different research questions within the biomedical, behavioral, social sciences, and even engineering. We will focus on MLM as it is used in behavioral and social science research, with examples from education and adult development. Specifically, we will discuss in detail two types of multilevel models: clustered-observation or organizational models (e.g., children nested within classrooms) and growth-curve models (e.g., estimation of change with measurements nested within people over months or years). If we have time, we can consider a third: daily experience models (e.g., daily or hourly measurements nested within people over days or weeks). Students will also learn how to use SAS Proc Mixed for conducting MLM analyses. Students are assumed to have taken at least two graduate statistics courses and have a solid understanding of regression analysis.", "name": "Special Topics in Clinical Psychology", "section": "20", "location": "Swift Hall 210", "topic": "Multi-Level Modeling", "course": "497-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 10:00AM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/PSYCH/497-0/33477", "instructor": ["Daniel K Mroczek"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33477", "subject": "PSYCH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course involves the study of the nature and diagnosis of psychiatric illness.
