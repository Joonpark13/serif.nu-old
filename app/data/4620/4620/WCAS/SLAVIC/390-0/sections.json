[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "While some artists try to make their work seamlessly mirror reality, others take advantage of art's capacity for exaggeration and deformation, fundamentally breaking with reality. In literature, this results in texts in which the Eiffel tower goes for a stroll and insects tell tales. Despite the fantastical nature of these stories, they show everyday objects in a new light by emphasizing traits that might otherwise go unnoticed. Art, therefore, can change the way one sees the world by reawakening one's perception of the ordinary. Theorist Viktor Shklovsky termed this process \"estrangement.\" <br/><br/>This course will guide students through understandings of this theory and its manifestation in twentieth-century Russian culture as it relates to topics as diverse as science fiction, autobiography, and Sots art. Readings will include short pieces from Krzhizhanovsky, Bulgakov, Aksyonov, Rubinstein, Pelevin and theoretical texts from Shklovsky, Eisenstein, Boym, and Deleuze.", "name": "Literature and Politics in Central and Eastern Europe", "section": "1", "location": "Annenberg Hall 101", "topic": "Estrangement in 20th-Century Russia", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/SLAVIC/390-0/34662", "instructor": ["Amanda Christina Allan"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>Interdisciplinary Distro - See Rules<br/><br/>Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34662", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
