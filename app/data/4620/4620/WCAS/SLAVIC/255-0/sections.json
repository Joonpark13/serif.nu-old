[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What is lyric poetry? What are its roots, and what are its possibilities today? How does it stand in relation to the countless other varieties of rhymed and/or rhythmic language?hymns, pop songs, advertising slogans, campaign mottoes, bumper stickers, and so on?that surround us in our daily life? We will explore these and many other questions by way of examining lyrics past and present, from psalms and hymns to epitaphs, elegies, songs, and love poems. This course will emphasize the varieties of lyric, both in English originals and in translation, with particular attention to the meanings of poetic form and the nature of poetic translation. We will pay special attention to the significance-be it private or public, political or personal-of lyric poetry in different cultures, with readings drawn chiefly from Anglo-American and Eastern European traditions. Poets to be read include: Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Jan Kochanowski, Walt Whitman, Gwendolyn Brooks, e.e. cummings, Anna Akhmatova, Wislawa Szymborska, Seamus Heaney, Yusef Komunyakaa, and others.", "name": "Slavic Civilizations", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute L251", "topic": "What is Lyric Poetry?", "course": "255-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/SLAVIC/255-0/34656", "instructor": ["Clare A Cavanagh"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34656", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
