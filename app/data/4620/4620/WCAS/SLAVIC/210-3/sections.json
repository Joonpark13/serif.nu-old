[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Russian literature addresses some of the most compelling topics individuals and communities face. In this course, we study texts that confront us with questions such as: What does it mean to live a righteous life? How can one die with dignity? How can we balance the rights of the individual with the needs of the community? What are the proper relations between men and women? Our approach to Tolstoy, Chekhov, and Bunin will synthesize close readings with the study of Russian political and intellectual history. We will analyze philosophical questions raised by our texts, and study how Russian literature reflects historical developments. We will also examine the special dialogue that takes place among these authors, and address problems of genre and narrative, or how the form of a story affects what the author can say.", "name": "Introduction to Russian Literature", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 102", "topic": "", "course": "210-3", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/SLAVIC/210-3/34654", "instructor": ["Susan McReynolds   Oddo"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>Given in English<br/><br/>", "id": "34654", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
