[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course we will investigate one book, Tolstoy's War and Peace, in detail. We will consider such themes as the nature of decision-making in a world of uncertainty, how consciousness works, the place of death in an understanding of life, the nature of selfhood, the possibility of a social science, whether history fits a pattern, along with other philosophical and psychological questions. We will also see how Tolstoy's innovations in plotting and presentation of character were designed to express his views about human life. If the course achieves its goal, students will want to read other major literary works and understand what makes them so compelling and so helpful in living a more meaningful life.
