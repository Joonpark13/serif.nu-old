[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is a broad survey of several of the main concepts in modern astrophysics. Topics to be covered include the basics of stars; the evolution of stars on the main sequence; stellar death and stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes); star formation; and the Milky Way and other galaxies. Time permitting, we will also cover the basics of cosmology. The course develops these astronomical concepts starting from undergraduate-level physics.", "name": "Astrophysics ISP", "section": "20", "location": "2122 Sheridan Rd Classroom 231", "topic": "", "course": "331-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ASTRON/331-0/37217", "instructor": ["Claude Andre   Faucher Giguere"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37217", "subject": "ASTRON"}]
