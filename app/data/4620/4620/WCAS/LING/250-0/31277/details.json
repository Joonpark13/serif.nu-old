We will learn to describe speech sounds in the three domains of speech: the articulatory domain (how speech sounds are produced in the human vocal tract), the acoustic domain (their form in the acoustic medium), and the perceptual domain (how listeners process the incoming speech signal). We will learn to recognize the ways in which speech sounds pattern in language to convey meaning, and the ways in which these patterns are similar and different across the languages of the world. Finally, we will learn about current speech technology as it applies to computerized speech synthesis and speech recognition."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lectures, in-class activities, homework projects"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Projects 40% <br/>Long Quiz 1 25% <br/>Long Quiz 2 35% <br/>Experiment Requirement Not graded, but required for full course credit"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Title: Vowels and Consonants<br/>Authors: Peter Ladefoged and Sandra Ferrari Disner<br/>Publication Date: May 7, 2012 <br/>ISBN-10: 1444334298<br/>ISBN-13: 978-1444334296 <br/>Edition: 3<br/><br/>Title: English Phonetics and Phonology<br/>Author: Philip Carr<br/>Publication Date: September 17, 2012<br/>ISBN-10: ISBN-10: 1405134542<br/>ISBN-13: ISBN-13: 978-1405134545<br/>Edition: 2"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:10 PM (CT)", "subject": "LING"}]
