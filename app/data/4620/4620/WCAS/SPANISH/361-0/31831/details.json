We will look into the fundamental artistic and literary movements that contributed to craft the image of modern Mexico: survey and studio photography and modernistas at the turn of century; the Mexican Revolution through the photojournalism in the Casasola Archive and Azuela's Los de abajo; The Mexican Renaissance in Muralismo and eccentric figures like Frida Kahlo; Estridentismo and modernist photographers (Tina Modotti, Manuel and Lola Alvarez Bravo); Mexican urbanization in the photography of Nacho L\u00f3pez and literary chronicles; Indigenous identity in the works of Mariana Yampolsky, Flor Gardu\u00f1o y Graciela Iturbide. We will pay attention to how these cultural expressions, artists and writers articulate and represent a vision of modernity in relation to fundamental categories like race, gender, class and native culture."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:24 PM (CT)", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
