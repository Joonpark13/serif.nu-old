We begin by foregrounding the role of the state and the history of U.S. immigration policies that continue to shape social and political experiences among the foreign-born. We then examine public opinion toward immigrants and immigration issues, highlighting the ways in which they are ideologically contested. Building from this, we turn our attention to how immigrants are incorporated in the U.S., with an emphasis on the significance of race and ethnicity in immigrant communities. Finally, drawing on empirical studies in the field of American politics, we focus on questions and explanations of immigrant participation and mobilization in the twenty-first century."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Contact the Professor directly for more information on the required books/materials for this course."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:17 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
