[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar focuses broadly on the organizational forms that constitute the international political environment. While the course discusses international organizations (IOs) such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, NATO, and World Health Organization, it is not strictly about IOs. The purpose of the course is to engage classic and frontier research that analyzes the organization of global politics and explores the variation in organizational forms in the international realm across time and space.", "name": "International Organization", "section": "20", "location": "Scott Hall 201 Ripton Room", "topic": "", "course": "442-0", "meeting_time": ["Fr 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/POLI_SCI/442-0/34271", "instructor": ["Stephen C Nelson"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34271", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
