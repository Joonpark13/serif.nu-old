[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Political science research relies on concepts (?country,' ?democracy,' ?voting,' ?power,' ?market') that are human, linguistic constructions. Their meaning, power, and relevance depend on how they are used and understood. Knowing how they are used and understood, in turn, requires interpretation. This course introduces students to methodological issues raised by interpretation. It is not limited to interpretive work alone, but addresses problems of interpretation as they crop up generally in political science scholarship. The goals of such scholarship vary from predicting to explaining to understanding to destabilizing and contesting dominant discourses. But in all cases there is interpretation. The gathering of events or people into \"kinds\" of events or \"kinds\" of people so as to manipulate them as variables in small-n or large-n analyses, for example, is an interpretive undertaking. For this reason this course seeks not only to introduce the student to interpretive methods narrowly conceived, but to place such methods against the backdrop of broader questions regarding what knowledge is, how we acquire it, and how interpretation contributes to that effort. To this end, we examine, successively, hermeneutics, genealogy, and deconstruction.", "name": "Methods of Political Inquiry", "section": "20", "location": "Scott Hall 201 Ripton Room", "topic": "", "course": "408-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/POLI_SCI/408-0/34273", "instructor": ["Michael M Loriaux"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "34273", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
