Yet the centrality of land in everyday life also means that it can become a<br/>source of contentious politics and violence. This class explores how struggles over access and rights to<br/>land shape different forms of conflict and violence: between squatters and state officials, different<br/>ethnic groups, or armed groups and the state.<br/>The course explores questions of land and conflict in several parts. We begin by examining the question<br/>of land meanings: what does land, property, and territory mean to different groups of people? How<br/>does this help us understand why people organize or fight around issues of land? Second, the course<br/>takes an historical and comparative view of the rules and institutions that shape people's rights and<br/>access to land. The third part of the class explores theories that link land to conflict and violence. We<br/>then apply these theories to explore a set of case studies of land-related conflict: from the recent armed<br/>uprising in Oregon to civil war in Colombia. The last part of the class moves toward policy<br/>considerations. How, for example, can a focus on land rights improve post-conflict resolution?<br/>The course is interdisciplinary in its approach, drawing heavily on political science and political<br/>geography. It should appeal to students interested in peace and conflict issues, environmental politics,<br/>international development, and human rights."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Course Requirements<br/>? Seminar Participation (30%)<br/>? Critical Review Papers (2 x 10%)<br/>? Final Research Paper (40%)<br/>? Presentation of Research Paper (10%)<br/>1. Participation<br/>Students are expected to participate actively in each class and engage with the comments of their<br/>classmates. Bi-Weekly questions: As part of the student's participation grade, I will ask students to send<br/>two questions that they want to discuss before each seminar. Students should send these questions to<br/>the class list no later than 8 am the morning that the class meets.<br/>2. Critical Review Papers<br/>Over the course of the semester, students will write two review papers based on the theme of a<br/>particular week. In the first paper, the student will analyze the theories and concepts from a set of<br/>readings, looking for assumptions or gaps in the literature (Concept paper). In the second paper,<br/>students will examine and critique a methodological approach and/or research design from a set of<br/>readings (Methods paper). Papers should be well argued and concise (avoiding summary of readings).<br/>Critical Review papers should be 5-6 pages (double-spaced).<br/>3. Research Paper<br/>Students will work on developing their research papers over the course of the semester. Papers should<br/>present a clear and well-motived research question that addresses themes or debates that we have<br/>covered in the class. The paper should also present a clear set of hypotheses and should draw on<br/>original data to support hypotheses. They should be 15-20 pages, due the final day of class.<br/>4. Final Presentation of Research<br/>Each student will give a 10-minute presentation based on their research paper during the last week of<br/>class.
