[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will identify the contours, causes, and consequences of social inequality. We will examine stratification according to race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation and other social categories in the US, and pay particular attention to how these categories intersect to create complex positions of privilege and disadvantage. The course will analyze broader patterns in power and access as well as specific accounts of individual and community experiences of inequality. We will review different theoretical perspectives on how social inequality is generated and reproduced, and potential social and political responses to these processes. Finally, we will expand our focus to outside of the US context to consider how international, political and economic systems shape global social inequalities.", "name": "Social Inequality: Race, Class, and Power", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G15", "topic": "", "course": "201-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/SOCIOL/201-0/34409", "instructor": ["Elizabeth Anne Onasch"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "34409", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
