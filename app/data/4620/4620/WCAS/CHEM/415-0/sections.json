While its arrival on the scene is already impacting materials science and molecular nanotechnology, it is also providing a new lease of life to chemical synthesis where mechanical bond formation occurs as a consequence of the all-important templation orchestrated by molecular recognition and self-assembly processes. The way in which covalent bond formation activates noncovalent bonding interactions, switching on molecular recognition that leads to self-assembly and the template-directed synthesis of mechanically interlocked moleculesof which the so-called catenanes and rotaxanes may be regarded as the prototypeshas introduced a level of integration into chemical synthesis that has not previously been attained. The challenge now is to carry this level of integration beyond relatively small molecules into the realms of precisely functionalized extended molecular structures and aggregated superstructures that perform functions in a collective manner as the key sources of instruction, activation and performance in multi-component integrated devices.<br/> <br/>In this course I will propose the adoption of the term mechanostereochemistry to describe the rapidly emerging area of chemical science where components of molecules and extended structures are mechanically interlocked or sterically encumbered in such a manner that the components interact dynamically with one another as a result of a panoply of weak noncovalent bonds and/or as a consequence of dynamic coordinative or covalent bonds. Mechanostereochemistry is the stereochemistry of molecules with mechanical bonds. The practice of mechanostereochemistry can be seen to have both a creative aspect (molecular recognition, self-assembly, templation, etc.) and a functional role (relative movements of components, switching, self-energizing, etc.) associated with its territory. Both the creative aspect and the functional role are dynamic in nature and ultimately molecular in context. The conundrum facing the wider chemical community at present is to unravel how to get from relatively small, yet highly programmable molecules to contraptions and gadgets that do something useful in the real world.<br/> <br/>Suggested Reading : \"Big and Little Meccano\" Tetrahedron 2008, 64, 8231-8263.", "name": "Advanced Organic Chemistry", "section": "03", "location": "Technological Institute LG68", "topic": "", "course": "415-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 8:00AM - 9:20AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/CHEM/415-0/33127", "instructor": ["James F Stoddart"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33127", "subject": "CHEM"}]
