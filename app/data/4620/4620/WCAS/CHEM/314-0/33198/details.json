This is a relatively new field of science that transcends the areas of chemistry, biology, and drug discovery. The major dogma in this field is to use principles of chemistry to provide answers to fundamental questions in biology and human medicine. <br/><br/>Particular emphasis in this field is placed on designing drug-like molecules (precursors to FDA drugs) and chemical reaction and use those molecules/reactions to study basic biological processes. These approaches are particularly powerful in the cases when standard biological techniques such as gene-knock out and RNAi to study biology do not work. The knowledge obtained during these studies is then directly translated into the drug discovery process, to produce new human medicines. The course introduces students into a wide variety of experimental techniques and control experiments using in the area of chemical biology. This course is suited for graduate students, as well as undergraduate students majoring in chemistry, chemical and biological engineering, biomedical engineering, and biology."}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:51 PM (CT)", "subject": "CHEM"}]
