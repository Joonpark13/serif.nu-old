[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The Chemistry 220 course provides an introduction to basic techniques of instrumental analysis such as gas and high performance liquid chromatography, uv/visible, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, elemental analysis by ICP atomic emission spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and differential scanning calorimetry. You will learn the theories behind these techniques in class lectures and you will learn to operate these instruments and analyze data from them in the lab. This course is evaluated completely as a lab course; that is, there are no midterm or final exams and the grade comes from lab reports, etc. based on the lab activities.", "name": "Introductory Instrumental  Analysis", "section": "01", "location": "Tech Institute Lecture Room 5", "topic": "", "course": "220-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/CHEM/220-0/33199", "instructor": ["Frederick J Northrup"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "33199", "subject": "CHEM"}]
