[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Tracing Latinidades<br/><br/>This graduate seminar will explore the diverse and multiple significations of the critical concept of Latinidad/es within Latino USA. While referring to a sense of collectivity, Latinidad/es also signals the tensions within, the horizontal hierarchies that structure different national communities of Latin American descent, and the power differentials within our population. We will explore both the fellowships and frictions that the term suggests, as well as the multiple social affiliations as these are inscribed in scholarship, fiction, and memoirs. Readings will focus on the geocultural urban spaces of New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, examining interlatino power dynamics and intralatino/a subjectivities.", "name": "Topics in Latino/a Literatures & Cultures", "section": "1", "location": "University Library 4646", "topic": "", "course": "430-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 2:00PM - 5:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/SPANPORT/430-0/31841", "instructor": ["Frances R Aparicio"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31841", "subject": "SPANPORT"}]
