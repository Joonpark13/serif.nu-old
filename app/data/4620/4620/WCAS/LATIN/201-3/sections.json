[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The third quarter of second-year Latin combines literary analysis with mastery of grammar and syntax at the intermediate level. A grade of C- or better satisfies the WCAS language requirement. <br/>This is mainly a workshop course, with discussion focusing on questions by members of the course. Though translation will be a component in evaluation, it will be a relatively minor criterion of success. The main topics of discussion will be how meaning and emphasis are communicated in Latin. <br/>Though Latin 201-3 concentrates on language skills, it also develops skills of analysis that are foundational for the future study of literature in any language.", "name": "Introduction to Latin Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L28", "topic": "", "course": "201-3", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/LATIN/201-3/37178", "instructor": ["Francesca   Tataranni"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37178", "subject": "LATIN"}]
