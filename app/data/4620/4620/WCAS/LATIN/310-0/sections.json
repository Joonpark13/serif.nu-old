[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The Odes of Horace are the quintessential achievement of a certain poetic ideal. Avowedly classical and monumental, they are works of deep learning and artistic confidence, poems which fully expect the close and careful study which they have always received and rewarded. They are public poems which aim both to reflect and augment the glory of a self-consciously glorious age and regime. Like that age and regime, they are \"great\" and \"golden.\"<br/><br/>And also very good: few poets rival Horace for poetic density, with his dizzying ratio of meaning to word-count, or for felicitas, with his unnerving knack for finding exactly the right words for a thought. And alongside their grandeur and self-possession and immortality, we find in them endlessly complicated intimations of mortal, anxious, and private Horaces: devotees of polyphonies will be well satisfied.<br/><br/>We will read most of Book 1 and selections of Books 2-4 of the Odes in Latin, working to uncover and appreciate their sensibility and their poetics, the particular way they are beautiful and rewarding and exciting and unforgettable.", "name": "Readings in Latin Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L04", "topic": "Horace", "course": "310-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/LATIN/310-0/37179", "instructor": ["John Kyrin Schafer"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>Reading in the language, discussion in English<br/><br/>Specific requirements in the language<br/><br/>", "id": "37179", "subject": "LATIN"}]
