[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is framed as a set of debates on the relations between Asian American and Black people in the contemporary U.S. Picking up where Asian and Black Historical Relations in the U.S. (ASAM/AFAM 218) left off (it is not a requirement to take 218), this course covers the historical racialization of these two groups by an examination of why and how these relations have either been defined as \"cooperative\" or \"conflictive,\" with the goal of analyzing how \"Blackness\" and \"Asianness\" are co-constitutive. In the first meeting of each week, we analyze and discuss the set of readings and films. The second meeting each week is structured around a student-led debate about the topic of the week. These include: the differential and overlapping racialization and sexualization of Blacks and Asians; Black and Asian labor in the U.S.; reparations; affirmative action; the 1992 L.A. riots; martial arts and Bruce Lee in African American communities; Asian/Black intermarriage; multiracial Blasians; and Asian Americans in hip hop.", "name": "Contemporary Asian Black Relations", "section": "1", "location": "University Hall 122", "topic": "", "course": "310-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ASIAN_AM/310-0/30901", "instructor": ["Nitasha Tamar Sharma"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "30901", "subject": "ASIAN_AM"}]
