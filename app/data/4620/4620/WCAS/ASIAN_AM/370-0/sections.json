[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The diversity of the Asian American experience includes the waves of refugees who arrived after 1975 fleeing war, revolution, and exile. How do Cambodians, Vietnamese, and Laotians fit the model minority myth? Is there inter-generational transfer of trauma and war to the second generation? This course focuses on the experiences of Vietnamese, Khmer, Lao, Hmong and ethnic Chinese from Southeast Asia. We will examine political and economic factors for their exodus and how they reconstruct their identities, families, and communities in the United States. This includes refugee camp experiences, and the adaptation of Southeast Asian American families in the US including issues such as educational experiences, occupational options, and homeland relations.", "name": "Studies in Diaspora", "section": "1", "location": "Annenberg Hall G32", "topic": "Southeast Asian American Experience", "course": "370-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ASIAN_AM/370-0/30900", "instructor": ["Jennifer A Huynh"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "30900", "subject": "ASIAN_AM"}]
