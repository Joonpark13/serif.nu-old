[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Growing numbers of inter-racial marriages and the products of these marriages?children of mixed racial descent?have contributed to the increasing diversity of America in the 21st century. Reflecting this heterogeneity, the 2000 Census allowed people to claim more than one background for the first time. In this course, we will evaluate the experiences of self-identified multiracials through an historical and comparative framework. This class will explore demographic and inter-racial and inter-ethnic marriage trends in various Asian communities in the U.S. in order to highlight the complexity of the Asian American and African American experience. Additionally, we will compare the experiences of multiraicals representing a range of backgrounds, including those of Asian/White and Asian/Black ancestry as well as Asian/Black heritage. Some of the specific topics that will be covered in this course include: racial and ethnic community membership and belonging; passing; the dynamics of inter-racial relationships; identity, authenticity, and choice; and the gender identities of mixed race individuals. This course highlights the simultaneous fluidity and social construction of race while marking its real impact on everyday and structural aspects of American life particularly through an analysis of fiction, media, and film.", "name": "The Mixed Race Experience", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall 107", "topic": "", "course": "251-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ASIAN_AM/251-0/30902", "instructor": ["Nitasha Tamar Sharma"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "30902", "subject": "ASIAN_AM"}]
