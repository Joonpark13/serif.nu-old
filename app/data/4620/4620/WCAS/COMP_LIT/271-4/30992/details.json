But especially since the 1960s, women make up a significant proportion of the most interesting contemporary writers. This course, in a sense a parallel to AMES/CLS 271-3 (Modern Japanese Literature), introduces a number of these newer creative voices, many of whom have won the major literary prizes in the past several decades. These more recent writers, and other writers from the late 19th and through the 20th centuries, show women meeting-sometimes triumphantly, often with great difficulty-the challenges of a changing social order with its changes in personal relationships between men and women.<br/>All readings in English translation."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Participation in class discussion; two short papers (4 pp.); one long final paper (10-12 pp.)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Reading List:<br/>Birnbaum, Rabbits, Crabs, Etc. <br/>Lippit and Selden, Contemporary Japanese Women Writers<br/>Enchi, Masks<br/>Tsushima, Child of Fortune"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
