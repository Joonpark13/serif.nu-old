Basically, we look at the idea that &quot;no matter how good a story is, there's more at stake in the telling.&quot; It is a premise of the course that how one writes is more interesting than what one writes, but of course, &quot;how&quot; is informed and determined by &quot;what,&quot; as well as &quot;why.&quot; So subject matter informs and determines style, form, and structure, and vice versa. We will approach these questions by reading a variety of novels and some short stories by authors from a number of different national contexts. Authors will likely include W.G Sebald (The Emigrants), Claudio Magris (Microcosms), Antonio Mu\u00f1oz Molina (Sepharad), Tayeb Saleh (Season of Migration to the North), Marguerite Yourcenar (Memoirs of Hadrian), Doris Lessing, Sadegh Hedayat (The Blind Owl), Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (Love in the Time of Cholera).<br/><br/>Instructor: Rabih Alameddine"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 7:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
