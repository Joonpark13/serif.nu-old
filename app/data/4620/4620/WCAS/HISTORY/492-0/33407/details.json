This seminar explores the various ways ideas, people, and things circulated between China and &quot;the West,&quot; (for our purposes, Europe and Great Britain, though we occasionally will to turn to the U.S.), from roughly 1500 to the mid-twentieth century. We will attempt to address three huge, complicated, questions: How did the West influence the emergence of modern China? How did the Chinese affect the transformation of the modern West? How did the cultural encounter between China and the West affect the course of world history? We will read some of the important new work that attempts to answer these questions. Students will then write a term paper on a particular issue of interest to them."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion"}], "lmod": "4/3/16 8:06 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
