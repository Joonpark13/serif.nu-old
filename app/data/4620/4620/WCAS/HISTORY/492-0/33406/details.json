As the field is reoriented away from its conventional northern Atlantic focus, scholars studying Latin America, Africa, and Europe have been compelled to take note of the field's insights, contributions, and analytical frameworks. We will read some of the best examples of this turn in Atlantic history, an inherently comparative, transnational, transcultural, and oceanic approach to the past, with an eye toward prevailing trends, methodologies, and topics; major schools of study; and ongoing debates about chronology, scope, and concepts (empire, nation, subject, citizen, slavery, feudalism, capitalism, commodity, ecosystem, revolution). What is the current state of the field? In what ways is the recent scholarship most persuasive?"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "In-class Presentations (2); Historiography paper (15-18pp)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "TENTATIVE READING LIST: <br/>J.H.
