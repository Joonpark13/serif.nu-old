[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The early Middle Ages were characterized by upheaval and dramatic social change. It is a period framed by symbolic disasters, inaugurated by \"the end of civilization\" with the fall of Rome and concluding with the anxieties surrounding the year 1000, when the world was supposed to end. And yet, despite these morbid markers, it was a time of immense creativity and energy during which the characteristic fusion of Roman, German, and Christian traditions laid the groundwork for European culture. Topics will include gender, Christianity, and the fall of Rome; monasticism and the preservation of culture; the rise of Islam; the \"Barbarian Emperor\" Charlemagne; feudalism, and the gradual ascendance of the papacy.", "name": "The Development of Medieval Europe: High & Late Middle Ages, 1000-1450", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute M164", "topic": "", "course": "332-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HISTORY/332-2/33373", "instructor": ["Dyan H Elliott"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33373", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
