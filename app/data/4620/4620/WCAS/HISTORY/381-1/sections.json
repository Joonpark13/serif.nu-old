[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "History 381-1 is a survey of Chinese history from the \"second commercial revolution\" (sixteenth through eighteenth centuries) to the fall of the imperial order in 1912. The course nevertheless focuses primarily on the late eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries. The course is basically chronological, but within this framework we will explore the themes of commercialization, social transformation, and the challenges of European, American, and Japanese imperialism. We also will study several \"modern transformations\" which begin to occur during the late imperial period: the transformation of the local elite, of traditional women's lives, of political culture, and of industrial production.", "name": "History of Modern China: Late Imperial China, 1600-1911", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 121", "topic": "", "course": "381-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/HISTORY/381-1/33393", "instructor": ["Mary B Young"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "33393", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
