Statistical methods that are particularly useful in analyzing sports data will be presented, including random-effects and mixed-effects models, methods of dimension reduction such as principal components analysis, and tree-based methods. Students will be expected to formulate their own sports-related research questions and to conduct the appropriate statistical analyses to answer them.", "name": "Undergraduate Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 111", "topic": "Analysis of Sports Data", "course": "398-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/STAT/398-0/36753", "instructor": ["Thomas A Severini"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "36753", "subject": "STAT"}]
