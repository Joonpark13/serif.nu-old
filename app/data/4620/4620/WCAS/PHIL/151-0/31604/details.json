When we draw a conclusion from a given basis so that the contrary of the conclusion might also hold in light of the same basis, our inference is non-deductive or inductive. Generalizations, classifying rules, predictions from experience, learning from experience, speculations about the past from present evidence (like in detective's or historian's hypotheses), all of these presuppose not only the data or experience we have but also rules of inference that make some ways of concluding from given evidence better arguments than others. Such rules of appropriate inductive reasoning are subject of this course. We will study the foundations of and philosophical questions about reasoning based on probability-assignments as well as such arising from reasoning from effects to causes."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Students of this course will acquire basic competency with probabilistic and patterns of causal reasoning as they are found in a wide range of scientific and everyday arguments to best establish conclusions under uncertainty. Students will also learn about the basic and profound philosophical problems connected with inductive reasoning and acquire a sensitivity to the role (or non-role) of such foundational issues in common empirical arguments."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "LectureSeminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Quizzes, exams including formal and (short) written assignments."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Ian Hacking, An Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic.
