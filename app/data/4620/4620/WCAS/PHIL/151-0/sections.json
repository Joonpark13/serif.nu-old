[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In scientific as much as in ordinary life, inferences and arguments that are not merely deductive are common. When we draw a conclusion from a given basis so that the contrary of the conclusion might also hold in light of the same basis, our inference is non-deductive or inductive. Generalizations, classifying rules, predictions from experience, learning from experience, speculations about the past from present evidence (like in detective's or historian's hypotheses), all of these presuppose not only the data or experience we have but also rules of inference that make some ways of concluding from given evidence better arguments than others. Such rules of appropriate inductive reasoning are subject of this course. We will study the foundations of and philosophical questions about reasoning based on probability-assignments as well as such arising from reasoning from effects to causes.", "name": "Scientific Reasoning", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 318", "topic": "", "course": "151-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 3:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/PHIL/151-0/31604", "instructor": ["Axel   Mueller"], "class_attributes": "Formal Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "31604", "subject": "PHIL"}]
