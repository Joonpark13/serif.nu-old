[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In recent years, it has becoming increasingly clear that \"theory\" is not the preserve of any particular discipline. At the same time that other disciplines have been enthusiastically adopting \"ethnography\" in one form or another as a research strategy, anthropologists have been borrowing perspectives from literary studies, philosophy, and history among other disciplines. This class will serve as an introduction - a consumer's guide of sorts - to thinkers whose ideas have been frequently cited, if not used, by contemporary anthropologists among others. The seminar will provide a forum for evaluating their relevance (or irrelevance) to the research agendas of students in the class.", "name": "Seminar in Contemporary Theory", "section": "1", "location": "ANTHRO Sem Rm 104 - 1810 Hinmn", "topic": "", "course": "475-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 3:00PM - 6:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ANTHRO/475-0/31984", "instructor": ["Robert   Launay"], "class_attributes": "Graduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "31984", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
