Include assignment and project information, if desired. <br/> <br/>This is an intensive 2-unit elementary German course that covers the material in German 101-2 and 101-3 during Spring Quarter. Many students in this course are continuing from the special course the department offered during Winter Quarter (German 101-1 MTuThF 3 or 4 p.m.) and there are others who began learning German in high school or who finished the first quarter of the 101 sequence at Northwestern. <br/><br/>German 101-2 takes place from March 29- April 29 and German 101-3 takes place from April May 2-May 31. I will compute the grades for 101-2 on the weekend of April 30-May 1. <br/><br/>We will continue to focus on developing proficiency in all four language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing, while using the culture and history of the German speaking countries as basic source materials.<br/><br/>During this final quarter of elementary German, readings and class activities focus on providing interesting perspectives on German life and culture. We will work with selected writings of Grimm, Brecht and Kafka, using them for discussion, performance and language acquisition activities. The highlight of the quarter is the in-class skit performances, the best of which are chose by the students for performance at the German Department's almost famous *Evening O' Skits.", "name": "Beginning German", "section": "26", "location": "Technological Institute M177", "topic": "", "course": "101-3", "meeting_time": ["MoTuThFr 4:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/GERMAN/101-3/31140", "instructor": ["John   Paluch"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "31140", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
