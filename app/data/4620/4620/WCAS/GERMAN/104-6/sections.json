[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "\"Like a dog\" - Kafka`s Resonance in Literature, Film, and Philosophy<br/><br/>Kafka`s great novel The Trial ends with the famous line that coincides with the protagonist's execution: \"Like a dog. It was as if the shame would outlive him.\" This course will reflect on the extraordinary force of Kafka`s figure of the dog with attention to a diverse selection of works of literature, film, and philosophy. We will explore how and why the figure of the dog emerges, as it does explicitly in Kafka, to solicit an examination of the limits of what we consider to be our humanity. For dogs seem to present the most enduring figures at once of intimate domestic attachment, and of social degradation and exclusion. From domestic dogs to wild wolves, and from Kafka`s Prague and mid-century London to contemporary Mexico City and South Africa, we will consider the figure of the dog insofar as it articulates discriminations within human societies, including race, class, and gender, as well as demarcating the distinction between the inside and the outside of the human community in general. Reflecting on the global reverberations of Kafka`s phrase, we will look at the ambivalent status of dogs and the humaneness of human relations to them, but also of the doggishness of human beings in their often inhuman or inhumane and in any case shameful relations to one another as well as to animals.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L05", "topic": "Like a dog: Kafka?s Resonance", "course": "104-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/GERMAN/104-6/31145", "instructor": ["Benjamin Lewis   Robinson"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>", "id": "31145", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
