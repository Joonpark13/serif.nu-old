[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course consists of a critical reading of Thucydides history of the Peloponnesian War and an investigation of the war itself. Current work has progressively exposed the writer Thucydides as both highly charged and a remarkable literary artist. This in turn has contributed to an increasing unease about Thucydides historical judgments and also his representations of fact. What factors drove Thucydides account? And how far can we reconstruct an independent history of the war? The class will meet one additional hour a week to read the Greek text.", "name": "Readings in Greek Literature", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 121", "topic": "", "course": "301-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/GREEK/301-0/37198", "instructor": ["Robert W Wallace"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "37198", "subject": "GREEK"}]
