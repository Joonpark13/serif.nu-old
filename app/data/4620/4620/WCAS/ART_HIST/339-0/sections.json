[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course surveys architecture in sixteenth-century Europe, examining buildings, urban planning, and landscape design in their sociocultural, political, and religious contexts. We begin with Italy and the work of great Renaissance architects such as Bramante, Michelangelo, and Palladio, before turning to the richly varied interpretations of the new classical style in the rest of Europe. We also briefly examine architectural connections to the larger Mediterranean world and colonial Latin America. Themes include: the revival of antiquity, the persistence of the Gothic, architectural theory and professional practice, and buildings as expressions of power and identity", "name": "Special Topics in Renaissance Art", "section": "1", "location": "Block Auditorium", "topic": "", "course": "339-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/ART_HIST/339-0/36694", "instructor": ["Johanna Dorothy Heinrichs"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "36694", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
