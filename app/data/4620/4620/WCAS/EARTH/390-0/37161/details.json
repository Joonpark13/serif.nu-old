It is in this relatively thin ?skin' of the Earth where we harvest our crops, store our drinking water, and build our homes. Therefore, quantitative understanding of the physics and chemistry of the surface and shallow subsurface is important at both human (e.g., natural hazards, water resource availability) and geologic (e.g., mountain building) timescales. This course will introduce the basic principles of climate science and watershed hydrology to enable students to interpret the form and function of hillslopes and river channels. Implications of process-based understanding will be extended to the mountain range scale by examining the pace and pattern of tectonically-driven landscape evolution observed in natural landscapes. Students will also be introduced to modern methods for measuring erosion and deposition rates including sediment and solute budget approaches, cosmogenic radionuclide dating, and low-temperature thermochronology. My teaching philosophy is to have students apply concepts introduced in lectures through extended group projects where they learn the fundamentals of making careful field observations, analyzing time-series data, processing remotely sensed data in a Geographic Information System (GIS), and testing theory against observations using analytical and numerical models. No prior experience in these techniques is expected."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "MATH 224 or PHYSICS 135-1 or instructor permission"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Apply principles of conservation of mass / momentum / energy of water and sediment in order to explain the styles and rates of erosion / transport / deposition observed in natural systems. <br/> <br/>- Interpret topography to infer climate, rock property, and tectonic influences on landscape evolution. <br/> <br/>- Develop skills in hypothesis testing by using `natural', analog, and numerical experiments."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Three lectures per week; one lab session per week; one mandatory weekend field trip (5/14)"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Three problem sets (8% each); three group projects (15% each); one final examination (15%); class and field trip participation (16%)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Geomorphology: the Mechanics and Chemistry of Landscapes / Robert S.
