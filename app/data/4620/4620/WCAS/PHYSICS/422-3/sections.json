[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "We will continue our development of the essential concepts in solid state physics, including electron-electron interactions, screening, Hartree and Hartree-Fock aproximations, anharmonicity of lattice vibrations, phonons in metals, types of insulators and their dielectric properties, magnetic order and spin waves, and the Landau-Ginzburg theory of superconductivity. If time permits we will consider topics such as the Hubbard model, and open questions in magnetism.", "name": "Condensed-Matter Physics", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute F280", "topic": "", "course": "422-3", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4620/WCAS/PHYSICS/422-3/37349", "instructor": ["Anupam K Garg"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "37349", "subject": "PHYSICS"}]
