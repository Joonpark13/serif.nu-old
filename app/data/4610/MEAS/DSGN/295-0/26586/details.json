Students will learn key methods of design thinking and will work in teams to apply those methods, designing a variety of solutions to a common, challenging problem. In addition to regular class meetings, the course will offer a series of workshops to help students develop specific prototyping skills, such as using a laser cutter, Solid Works and Photoshop, and editing videos. Students will be required to take at least one workshop but may take more. At the end of the quarter, students will present their design solutions to stakeholders interested in the problem.<br/><br/>Open to all Northwestern students."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:35 PM (CT)", "subject": "DSGN"}]
