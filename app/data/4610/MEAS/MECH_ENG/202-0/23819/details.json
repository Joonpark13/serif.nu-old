Kinetics of rigid bodies in planar motion. Moments of inertia of rigid bodies. This course introduces students to the basic physical laws governing the the interaction of bodies. This course is essential for all future engineers, since all the objects in the world obey these laws, and no machine may be built without their knowledge. Topics include: Velocities and accelerations of particles relative to any reference frame. Velocity and acceleration differences of any two particles. Relative angular velocities and angular accelerations of coplanar rigid slabs. Two-dimensional rolling. Mass centers and moments of inertia. Dynamics of a general collecton of particles: Linear momentum, angular momentum, and kinetic energy results of Newton's laws. Calculation of linear momentum, angular momentum, and kinetic energy of a rigid body in plane motion. Dynamics problems involving particles and rigid bodies in plane motion. Point mass and rigid body dynamics problems."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: GEN_ENG 205-4.
