Micro-manufacturing for the purposes of this course was defined as the creation of high precision 3-dimensional products using a wide variety of materials with feature sizes in the range of tens of micrometers to a few millimeters. The course focuses on the emerging global trend toward product miniaturization and the accompanying trend toward the miniaturization of manufacturing equipment and systems. Fundamental scientific and technological topics associated with miniaturization will be discussed. <br/><br/>Topics: <br/>\u00b7 Introduction to Micro-manufacturing <br/>\u00b7 Scaling Laws <br/>\u00b7 Micro-Machining <br/>\u00b7 Micro-Forming <br/>\u00b7 Micro-Molding <br/>\u00b7 Micro-EDM and ECM <br/>\u00b7 Micro-Joining and Micro-Assembly <br/>\u00b7 Additive Processes <br/>\u00b7 Micro-Metrology <br/>\u00b7 Sensor Systems and Controls <br/>\u00b7 Design for Micro-Manufacturing"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "ME340-1 (Introduction to Manufacturing Processes) or permission of instructor."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Handouts"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Homework (25%): Assigned on Tuesdays.
