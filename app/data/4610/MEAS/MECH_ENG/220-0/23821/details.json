Historical perspectives on the evolution of this field and its gradual development into a modern branch of science will be presented. The applications of the First and the Second Laws of thermodynamics to the analysis of performance and efficiency of pumps, compressors, turbines, nozzles, diffusers, and other engineering systems will be discussed."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "An Introduction to Thermal Physics, Daniel V.
