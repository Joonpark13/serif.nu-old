Materials and mechanics issues related to the behavior of these advanced or \"smart\" materials will be highlighted. Constitutive models for macroscale representation of the material response to mechanical load, temperature changes, electric field, etc. will be studied. Microscale mechanisms responsible for their unique properties, such as molecular mobility and phase transitions will be discussed. The course will focus primarily on polymers and shape memory alloys, with introductions to the other materials and possibility for greater depth on a given material of interest via a course project (in lieu of final exam).", "qtr": "Winter 2016", "name": "Mechanics of Advanced Materials", "title": "MEAS MECH_ENG 456-0-1 Mechanics of Advanced Materials", "lmod": "1/9/16 6:36 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/467-2347", "instructor_name": "L Catherine   Brinson", "instructor_addr": "Technological Institute, Rm A214, 2145 Sheridan Rd, EV CAMPUS"}], "topic": "", "course": "456-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course will cover polymer viscoelasticity, shape memory materials, piezoelectric materials, electro-rheological fluids, magnetostrictive materials.
