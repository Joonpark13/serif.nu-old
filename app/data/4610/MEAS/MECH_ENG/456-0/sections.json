[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will cover polymer viscoelasticity, shape memory materials, piezoelectric materials, electro-rheological fluids, magnetostrictive materials. Materials and mechanics issues related to the behavior of these advanced or &quot;smart&quot; materials will be highlighted. Constitutive models for macroscale representation of the material response to mechanical load, temperature changes, electric field, etc. will be studied. Microscale mechanisms responsible for their unique properties, such as molecular mobility and phase transitions will be discussed. The course will focus primarily on polymers and shape memory alloys, with introductions to the other materials and possibility for greater depth on a given material of interest via a course project (in lieu of final exam).", "name": "Mechanics of Advanced Materials", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "456-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/MEAS/MECH_ENG/456-0/27752", "instructor": ["L Catherine   Brinson"], "id": "27752", "subject": "MECH_ENG"}]
