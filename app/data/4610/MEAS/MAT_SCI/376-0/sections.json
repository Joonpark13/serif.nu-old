[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to synthesis, processing, characterization, and applications of nanomaterials. The course will be structured as a series of integrated lecture and discussion sessions that review foundational concepts in nanoscience in the context of recent research breakthroughs. The lectures will be provided by experts from the Center for Nanoscale Materials and Material Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory. Specific topics to be emphasized include nanoparticles, nanomaterial synthesis and nanofabrication, cutting-edge characterization tools, functional nanomaterials, and biological nanomaterials. In addition, promising applications of nanomaterials in areas of energy conversion, medical therapeutics and diagnostics, and information storage will be explored. Students will gain a broad perspective on nanomaterials research and will receive useful training in proposal preparation to attract resources supporting their research.", "name": "Nanomaterials", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "376-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 9:00AM - 9:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/MEAS/MAT_SCI/376-0/24699", "instructor": ["Lincoln James Lauhon"], "id": "24699", "subject": "MAT_SCI"}]
