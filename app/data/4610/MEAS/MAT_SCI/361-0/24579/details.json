Basic diffraction theory; reciprocal space. Applications to structure analysis, preferred orientation. Diffractometer techniques with point detectors and 2D area detectors. Lectures, laboratory. <br/>Course Outcomes:<br/><br/>1. Students will be able to identify different types of crystal structures that occur in metals, ceramics, and polymers.<br/><br/>2. Students will be able to perform standard x-ray diffraction measurements on metals, ceramics and polymers and quantitatively interpret the results.<br/><br/>3. Students will attain an intermediate level of understanding for the particle and wave physical processes underlying x-ray emission, elastic and inelastic scattering, absorption, and interference of coherent waves. They will understand how these processes manifestly explain 3D and 2D kinematical diffraction, thin-film diffraction, conventional and synchrotron x-ray sources, x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and low-energy electron diffraction.<br/><br/>4. Students will understand how to use reciprocal space graphical constructions and vector algebra to interpret diffraction from 3D and 2D single crystals, and random and textured polycrystalline samples. <br/><br/>Relationship to Department Objectives http://www.matsci.northwestern.edu/mission.html<br/>Supports 1, 2, 4, 5, 13, 15"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "1.
