[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "This course covers the mechanics and microstructure of structural materials for high-temperature applications. The mechanisms of time-dependent deformation and failure at high homologous temperature are treated in a quantitative manner.  Materials used at high temperature (metals, ceramics and their composites) are reviewed, with emphasis on the relationship between microstructure and high-temperature mechanical properties.", "name": "High Temperature Materials", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "435-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/MEAS/MAT_SCI/435-0/24657", "instructor": ["David C Dunand"], "id": "24657", "subject": "MAT_SCI"}]
