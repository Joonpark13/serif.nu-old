The mechanisms of time-dependent deformation and failure at high homologous temperature are treated in a quantitative manner. Materials used at high temperature (metals, ceramics and their composites) are reviewed, with emphasis on the relationship between microstructure and high-temperature mechanical properties."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "No Books Required for this class."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:36 PM (CT)", "subject": "MAT_SCI"}]
