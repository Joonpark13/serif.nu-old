[{"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "This class is designed to generate discussion about the role of the foreign correspondent and the domestic reporter in an age when the American audience seems increasingly disconnected with the world, even though the world has greater influence on U.S. society than ever before. We will also examine how our own cultural mores and biases may influence our reporting on other societies, and will review ethical dilemmas unique to foreign reporting. Our goal is to understand contemporary international issues and best practices in international reporting. Another expectation is that you will get practical, nuts-and-bolts information on getting started in a foreign environment. Guests from various publications will visit, either in person or via phone. We will also view several video reports that illustrate and underscore the themes of the class, including ideological and regional conflicts, economics, war reporting and the environment. Students also learn how to get started working a beat in another country.", "name": "Global Journalism", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "410-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 9:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/JOUR/JOUR/410-0/27007", "instructor": ["Loren   Ghiglione"], "id": "27007", "subject": "JOUR"}, {"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "This class is designed to generate discussion about the role of the foreign correspondent and the domestic reporter in an age when the American audience seems increasingly disconnected with the world, even though the world has greater influence on U.S. society than ever before.
