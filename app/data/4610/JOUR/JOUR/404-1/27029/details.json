Deadline journalism (game stories), features, profiles, investigative, historical and first person pieces are all fair game on the sports page, with venerable traditions.? <br/> <br/>Students in this course will explore all of these genres - through reading, lecture and discussion - and practice in each, as well, through a workshop format with their peers. <br/>??? <br/>You do not need to be interested in sports writing or even sports to succeed in this course - only good journalism and good story telling.? You will also be held to a very high level of professional conduct.?"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:37 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
