Wells' campaign against lynching to the acclaimed documentary &quot;The Interrupters,&quot; which examines gang violence, Chicago has long fostered journalism that tackles- and attempts to influence - the nation's most compelling and complex issues. In this course, students will analyze crucial moments in social-issues journalism in one of the world's great cities. At the same time, through a partnership with Medill's Social Justice News Nexus, students will produce reporting involving a current cluster of topics critical to Chicago: segregation, inequality and housing."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:37 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
