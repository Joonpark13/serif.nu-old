[{"school": "SESP", "overview_of_class": "This course takes a closer look at the two most important areas of curriculum and instruction: Instructional Design and Assessment. In the first half of the course, students will gain an overview of various approaches to curriculum design and instructional models, including the history and theory of each approach and opportunities to practice them through lesson/unit planning, simulations, and micro-teaching. In the second half of the course, students will investigate several kinds of assessments, including formative and summative assessments, and how those assessments are closely linked to instructional design, teaching, and learning. Opportunities will be given to practice grading, providing good feedback, and managing a class assessment system.", "name": "Instructional Design and Assessment", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "436-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:00PM - 9:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SESP/MS_ED/436-0/26762", "instructor": ["Timothy A.
