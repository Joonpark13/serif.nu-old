[{"school": "SESP", "overview_of_class": "In this course we explore multiple major theories of typical cognitive and affective development, and their concomitant approaches to understanding and managing neurodiversity in the inclusive classroom.  The focus is on integrating across theoretical frameworks in order to maximize classroom support and minimize the need for individual differentiation for students struggling with physical, academic or emotional challenges, including learning disabilities, emotional disturbance, attention deficit disorder, and autism spectrum disorder.  Theoretical concepts are introduced in both readings and lecture.  Teamwork exercises designed to promote research and theory-based practice provide students with opportunities to analyze increasingly complex case studies, while developing skills in educational leadership, collegial collaboration and student advocacy.  Appropriate for graduate students interested in educational practice, administration and/or policy.", "name": "Educating Exceptional Children", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute M120", "topic": "", "course": "327-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SESP/TEACH_ED/327-0/26954", "instructor": ["Laurel Lee Burman"], "class_attributes": "No Freshmen<br/><br/>", "id": "26954", "subject": "TEACH_ED"}]
