This course is the most focused on learning of any LOC course. However, in contrast to a typical cognitive science or cognitive psychology class, most of the material in this course is set in organizational contexts. For example, when discussing judgment and decision making, we use examples from medical practice and policy.

Although the primary focus is on learning and cognition, we do set these examples from the legal system. Although the primary focus is on learning and cognition, we do set these examples in organizational context. <br/><br/>This course is relevant for all students in SESP (and beyond).
