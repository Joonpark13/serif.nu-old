Religious communities have a long-standing practice of providing for the poor, the hungry, the sick, the homeless, those with disabilities and so on. There are faith-based efforts to build peace, seek social justice, defend human rights and serve the common good. Religious institutions have created and supported hospitals, schools and facilities to care for children and the elderly. Whether undertaken by individuals or groups, all these efforts seem to spring from religious commitments and they endeavor to make a difference in the public sphere. Religion motivates many people to do good, even when doing good requires personal sacrifice."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "SESP"}]
