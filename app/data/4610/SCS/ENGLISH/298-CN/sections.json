[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "In this writing-intensive course, we read canonical and noncanonical American texts in order to develop some theoretical sophistication in reading narrative and crafting literary arguments. We explore different methods of interpreting narrative in terms of genre (What happens to us as readers when we place a text in a specific genre, such as the detective story or Great American Novel? How do generic expectations work on our interpretive experience?); aesthetic form (What do we mean when we call a writer's prose \"beautiful\" or a plot well-constructed? How do literary standards work to constitute values?); and ideological content (How do we judge a text's position in relation to historical and contemporary political issues, including-but not limited to-matters of gender, race and class?). Our focusing lens is the theme of criminality: What counts as transgression against norms, both within texts (Who are the criminals? Who makes the laws? What is appropriate punishment for crimes?) and in our wider literary culture (What makes a text obscene and therefore criminal? What makes a text worthy or unworthy of serious consideration? Who makes these literary \"laws\"?) As an introductory seminar and requirement for English majors, the course focuses deeply on the composition and revision of effective literary arguments. Students who enroll should have fulfilled the SCS writing requirement or taken equivalent writing courses.", "name": "Introductory Seminar in Reading and Interpretation", "section": "64", "location": "University Hall 121", "topic": "Crime & Criminal in American Narratives", "course": "298-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/ENGLISH/298-CN/27776", "instructor": ["William J Savage"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27776", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
