[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course provides an introduction to concepts in the relatively new field of behavioral economics. The concepts are interdisciplinary in nature, drawing on other social sciences such as psychology or sociology, and physical sciences such as biology. In this sense, the field continues the \"behavioral revolution\" of the social sciences that began in the 1950s. This is a survey course designed to better understand the cognitive, emotional, and physical independent variables that weigh on the dependent variables of economic decision making. We consider both individual and collective actions and the general extension of standard economic models offered by behavioral economic models. <br/><br/>This course may be applied toward the Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Finance.", "name": "Behavioral Economics", "section": "62", "location": "University Hall 101", "topic": "", "course": "330-CN", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/ECON/330-CN/27772", "instructor": ["John P McCarthy"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27772", "subject": "ECON"}]
