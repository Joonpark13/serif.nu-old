It features in-depth analysis of the theories of audit evidence, sampling, legal responsibilities, internal control, and audit planning, and how all of these apply to audits and to the profession. The course addresses the function of auditing in the economic and political system, and investigates how economic and political changes affect the auditing profession. The professional standards auditors must meet, as well as underlying ethical principles, are also covered. Case studies, including nonprofits, for-profits, and manufacturing and services companies and organizations, are used so that students can learn from each other's experiences and develop team skills as they apply auditing principles to real situations. Students are encouraged to share articles and their own experiences related to auditing and auditors, and to develop them into short case studies", "name": "Auditing I", "section": "15", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "350-DL", "meeting_time": ["TBA"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/ACCOUNT/350-DL/27730", "instructor": ["Jay I Mages"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27730", "subject": "ACCOUNT"}]
