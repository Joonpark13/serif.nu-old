[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This studio course will explore digital photography as an art medium. Students will learn basic skills regarding digital input and output of photographic images and learn of its history and contemporary usage. Methods of instruction will include lectures, demonstrations, discussions, critiques and individual meetings. The essential workings of Photoshop on a Macintosh computer will also be covered in the course. Group critiques of shooting assignments will occur throughout the quarter, and an independent final project will complete the course portfolio. Students work during class sessions as well as independently; they should be prepared to work in the digital lab outside of scheduled class meeting times. Evaluation of student performance is based on engagement and participation, ability to absorb and implement information and a final project. For the course, students will need a digital camera that can be operated fully manually and in the RAW format. Contact instructor with questions about camera and its settings.", "name": "Introduction to Digital Photography", "section": "65", "topic": "", "course": "151-CN", "meeting_time": ["We 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/ART/151-CN/27755", "instructor": ["Pamela L Bannos"], "id": "27755", "subject": "ART"}]
