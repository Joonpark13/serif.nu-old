This course examines theories and concepts in communication studies in the domain of the popular medium of film. As film is its own form of communication, the course explores how it influences our everyday communication in a variety of contexts, while analyzing different aspects of communication studies, which may include intrapersonal communication, relational communication, group communication and organizational communication, intercultural communication, as well as public address.
