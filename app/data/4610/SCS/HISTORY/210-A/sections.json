[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course will explore major events in American history from the first encounters between Natives, Europeans, and Africans though the Civil War, using evolving understandings of freedom as an interpretive framework. For many people, early America was a testing ground, marketplace, and battlefield for differing interpretations of liberty. In this course, we will trace the experiences of men and women, sailors and farmers, planters and slaves, Indians and colonists, and how this diverse group of people struggled to decide the meaning and extent of freedom. Was it universal? Bounded by ethnicity, religion, gender, or nation? Where did freedom come from? Did government threaten or protect freedom? We will read primary sources to seek out the voices of both famous and ordinary people as they grappled with these and other questions, and how both their answers and questions changed over time. Ideas about freedom shaped?and were shaped by?transatlantic migrations, religious revivals, wars of empire and independence, political upheavals, and global economic transformations. While exploring these ideas, this course will help students develop their historical thinking and writing abilities.", "name": "History of the United States", "section": "62", "topic": "", "course": "210-A", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/HISTORY/210-A/27783", "instructor": ["Ian Thomas Saxine"], "id": "27783", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
