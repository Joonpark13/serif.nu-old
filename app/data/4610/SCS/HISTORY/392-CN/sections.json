[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Over the past two hundred years, the growth of cities has transformed patterns of living in nearly every country in the world: by one estimate, the proportion of the planet's urban population has grown from 3% in 1800 to 50% in 2008. We will explore how and why people across time and space have tried to shape urban places?from the 19th-century industrial city to today?and ask what it means to actually plan a city.<br/><br/>Using primary sources, we will examine a range of plans and planners, from architects and government officials to real estate developers and community activists working on the ground. We use case studies in Europe, Asia, and the Americas to explain such movements as sanitary reform, the City Beautiful, urban renewal, and the recent rise of &quot;Global Cities&quot; such as Tokyo, London, and New York. We'll also treat Chicago as a classroom?taking field trips into the city to read the history of urban planning in its landscape.", "name": "Topics in History:", "section": "65", "topic": "Global History of Urban Planning, 1850-2000", "course": "392-CN", "meeting_time": ["We 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/HISTORY/392-CN/27795", "instructor": ["Samuel John Miller Kling"], "id": "27795", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
