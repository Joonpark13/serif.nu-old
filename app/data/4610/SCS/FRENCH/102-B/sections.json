[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course is the second quarter of the three-quarter Intermediate French sequence for students who have completed French 102-A or equivalent French course.<br/><br/>The Intermediate French sequence is scheduled in a hybrid format, meeting weekly in a combination of one in-class session on campus and an hour-long online session that students can complete in their own time. The sequence aims to strengthen and expand oral and written communication and comprehension skills as well as cross-cultural competence by immersing students in authentic cultural contexts and materials through class activities and regular practice and study. We use the textbook R\u00e9seau and its accompanying online program MyFrenchLab, and incorporate a variety of texts, music, video clips and the Internet. Through discovery of the contemporary French-speaking world, its cultures and literature, this course enables you to actively participate in a French-speaking environment, preparing you for travel in French-speaking countries and further studies in French. It provides those who wish to complete their language requirement with a path to proficiency. Classes are conducted in French except when explanation of grammar or other material may necessitate the use of English. Active participation and homework time outside of class are essential. Carries humanities credit (two-course limit for language courses).", "name": "Intermediate French II", "section": "62", "topic": "", "course": "102-B", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/FRENCH/102-B/27782", "instructor": ["Dominique Mary Licops"], "id": "27782", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
