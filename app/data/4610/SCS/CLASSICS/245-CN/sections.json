[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Say on, sayers! sing on, singers/!Delve! mould! pile the words of the earth!/Work on, age after age, nothing is to be lost,/It may have to wait long, but it will certainly come in use,/When the materials are all prepared and ready, the architects shall appear. - Walt Whitman, &quot;A Song of the Rolling Earth&quot;<br/><br/>In a sense, the &quot;architects&quot; whose materials have been prepared by millennia of singers and storytellers are today's movie makers. This course surveys films that draw their inspiration and content from the classical imagination: ancient historical sagas, myths, legends, drama, and fantasy, all the lasting gifts of the Muses. Students learn the cultural and literary background of these stories, then view and discuss selected films concerning classical themes: The Trojan War and its heritage of characters, the &quot;heroic&quot; stories of the likes of Odysseus/Ulysses, Hercules, Jason, the stories of timeless family issues which have found their way into the Greek Tragedies, and other enduring themes which have inspired films with ballets, musicals, opera, animation, and even futuristic myths of outer space. Presented in a five-week format, this course meets for five Saturdays from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm: 2/20, 2/27, 3/5, 3/12, 3/19.
