[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Advanced human physiology builds on the concepts covered physiology 217 focusing on the body as an integrated set of systems.  Our task will be to construct a global view of the body, its systems, and the many processes that keep the systems working.  This course emphasizes an integrated approach to studying all major organ systems including neural, autonomic/somatic motor, endocrine, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, digestive, immune, and reproductive physiology. In addition to integration, each lecture will focus on the clinical relevance of the organ system that will include abnormal function, disease states and medications used to bring the system back to normal functioning.", "name": "Advanced Human Physiology", "section": "14", "topic": "", "course": "318-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/BIOL_SCI/318-CN/27760", "instructor": ["Charles Neil Rudick"], "id": "27760", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
