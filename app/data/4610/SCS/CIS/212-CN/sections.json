The course is the first of two courses in object-oriented programing for the Information Systems major. The course begins with a quick introduction to the basics of the Java language: variables, conditionals, looping and user-defined methods. Students write programs that utilize methods, arrays and array lists and exception handling for solving problems. Information hiding, inheritance, polymorphism, aggregation and interfaces as principles of object-oriented programming will be introduced. This course includes interactive lectures and labs. Students will be required to complete multiple computer programs and quizzes. A final assignment is required for students to illustrate their understanding of all programming topics covered in the course.", "qtr": "Winter 2016", "name": "Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming", "title": "SCS CIS 212-CN-14 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming", "lmod": "1/9/16 6:41 PM (CT)", "section": "14", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Jacqueline Ann Bird", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "212-CN", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course focuses on developing complex programs using the Java object-oriented language.
