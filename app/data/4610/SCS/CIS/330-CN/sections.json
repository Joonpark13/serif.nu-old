[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is an area of practice that encompasses the job duties information architecture, experience or interface design, as well as usability testing and research. These disciplines and their practitioners have transformed the way we use computers. This course touches upon understanding people and some of the fundamentals of their cognitive and physical abilities, as well as upon computers and the way they solve human problems, much of it involving limitations of code, screens, colors and input. However, the main topic we cover is interfaces, the way people use and interact with computers. The course will delve deeply into design and prototyping of interfaces and testing how people interact with them. We will then iterate and learn from our assumptions in order to create a more user-focused design. While no prior programming experience is required the student will benefit from deep experience with computing conventions as well as appreciation and willingness to learn the fundamentals of design.", "name": "Human Computer Interaction", "section": "12", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 701", "topic": "", "course": "330-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/CIS/330-CN/27799", "instructor": ["Michael Brian Dain"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27799", "subject": "CIS"}]
