[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "2015 marks the fortieth anniversary since the end of the Vietnam war, and despite the passage of time, the question of whether it was a winnable war continues to be debated. Should the U.S. have escalated and moved more aggressively towards counter-insurgency? Or was Vietnam never winnable and if not, why? Was the problem rooted in American politics or military deficiency? This course is an analysis rather than a history of the war in Vietnam. We will closely examine the relationship between state and military in terms of goals, methods and assessments of outcomes. Themes covered in the course include the bases for insurgency; anti-colonial wars; counter insurgency; the role of bombing in Vietnam; the loss of support from the American public; the role of partisan politics in running the war; and other related themes. Course texts may include Andrew Krepinevich, The Army and Vietnam; Jeffrey Race, War Comes to Long An; Harry Summers, On Strategy, as well as material published on the various approaches to assessing progress used by the U.S. Department of Defense and later critiqued by contemporary social scientists such as Stathis Kalyvas and Jonathan Caverley.", "name": "Political Research Seminar", "section": "64", "location": "University Hall 101", "topic": "The Vietnam War", "course": "395-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/POLI_SCI/395-CN/27824", "instructor": ["Jeffrey   Rice"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27824", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
