[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Scholars of comparative politics analyze how and why countries differ from each other - and why those differences matter. Why are some countries democracies, while others are not? What kind of non-democratic regimes exist? Why do some countries transition from authoritarianism into democracy? Why are some countries rich and others poor? Can states rely on good policies to develop economically, or are some countries simply stuck on a low-growth path? Does democracy help or hurt economic growth? What causes civil wars, social revolutions, and other forms of political violence? By delving into these and other big questions, students in this course will gain vital knowledge of the core concepts, methodological tools, and theoretical approaches that enable political scientists to comprehend the various countries of the world.", "name": "Introduction to Comparative Politics", "section": "65", "location": "Parkes Hall 212", "topic": "", "course": "250-CN", "meeting_time": ["We 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/POLI_SCI/250-CN/27822", "instructor": ["Moses   Khisa"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27822", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
