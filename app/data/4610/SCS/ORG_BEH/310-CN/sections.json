[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Managing change has become a constant for leaders across all organization types and industry sectors. This course will be integrating and building upon the fundamental subjects covered through the Leadership Certification program with a particular focus on how to identify and manage change at a system's level. We will be using John Kotter's eight-step change model as the primary framework and learning tool and the book Switch, which identifies two primary change characteristics. Within the context of formal change management best practices, we will study the impact and role of employee engagement and culture, corporate social responsibility, organizational structure and diversity on the types of adaptive/strategic change drivers that are now a fundamental part of organizational success.", "name": "Organizational Change", "section": "17", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 408", "topic": "", "course": "310-CN", "meeting_time": ["Sa 9:00AM - 12:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/ORG_BEH/310-CN/27812", "instructor": ["Aleen Marcia Bayard"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27812", "subject": "ORG_BEH"}]
