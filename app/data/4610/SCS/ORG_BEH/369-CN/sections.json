The central component of the course is building the student's capacity, vocabulary, and instincts for strategic thinking, which is stimulated through in-class debates, discussions, and activities. We'll look at companies that are early in the process and get updates through the quarter from senior management on their progress and problems; we'll also look at later-stage companies and the challenges they face as an equity transition, IPO, buyout, or management transition approaches.

Examine these paths with an eye toward profitability and market position.<br/><br/>Consider the human resources, capital needs, and intellectual property requirements of innovation and what non-monetary challenges face companies looking to adopt technology or become more innovative."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "There is no reading list for this course.

The instructor's view is that all companies are technology companies, or must have a technology component/strategy to succeed. We take a broad view of technology that not only includes the world of computers, software, and apps, but includes other technologies like Amazon's use of UPS shipping services (a logistics technology problem) and small clinics' struggles to adopt HIPAA-compliant recordkeeping systems (a data warehousing technology problem). Students should be ready to be quick on their feet, to be part of the discussion, and to contribute to the debate."}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/ORG_BEH/369-CN/27815", "instructor": ["Karl Tan Muth"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27815", "subject": "ORG_BEH"}]
