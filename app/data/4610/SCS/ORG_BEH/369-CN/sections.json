[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course covers the new venture from concept to capital using a hybrid case study method. While the course focuses on the U.S. market and the lifecycle between business plan and the first major transition of equity, the course also touches on regulatory structures, financing projections, debt and convertible debt strategies, traditional and non-traditional compensation, and market conditions analysis. The central component of the course is building the student's capacity, vocabulary, and instincts for strategic thinking, which is stimulated through in-class debates, discussions, and activities. We'll look at companies that are early in the process and get updates through the quarter from senior management on their progress and problems; we'll also look at later-stage companies and the challenges they face as an equity transition, IPO, buyout, or management transition approaches. Students are expected to be prepared for a challenging conversation each week.", "name": "Entrepreneurship and Technology", "section": "12", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 512", "topic": "", "course": "369-CN", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/ORG_BEH/369-CN/27815", "instructor": ["Karl Tan Muth"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27815", "subject": "ORG_BEH"}]
