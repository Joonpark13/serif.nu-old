[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "The focus of this course will be on those quantitative tools that are primarily used in the field of finance. In particular, we will put heavy emphasis on the mathematics of interest rates, including the tools used to value common stock and fixed rate bonds. We will discuss how rates of return for these instruments are measured. We will then look at the capital budgeting process and learn how managers determine in which projects to invest a firm's limited resources. We will also study the probabilistic and statistical tools necessary to understand how investors and financial economists evaluate risk. Primary emphasis will be on understanding expected value, variance/covariance and standard deviation, correlation analysis, portfolio theory and linear regression analysis as they apply to finance. Finally, we will discuss current issues regarding the world of finance, such as the 2008-9 financial crisis and the current European debt crisis.", "name": "Introduction to Finance", "section": "66", "location": "Parkes Hall 214", "topic": "", "course": "202-CN", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/FINANCE/202-CN/27779", "instructor": ["William J Arndt"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27779", "subject": "FINANCE"}]
