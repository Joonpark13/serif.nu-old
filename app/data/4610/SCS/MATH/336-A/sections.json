[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This is an introduction to number theory, suitable for students with little more than high-school algebra experience. Nevertheless, one is able to quickly begin stating and proving some subtle, important, and beautiful results in this course. The topics to be covered include the Euclidean algorithm and unique factorization, the prime numbers, congruences, diophantine equations, approximating irrational numbers, and continued fractions. The topics will be enlivened by placing them in their historical context, and applications to cryptography will be given throughout. The capstone of the course will be a detailed discussion at the end of the RSA method of public-key encryption.", "name": "Introduction to the Theory of Numbers", "section": "65", "location": "Lunt Hall 105", "topic": "", "course": "336-A", "meeting_time": ["We 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/MATH/336-A/27809", "instructor": ["Sandy L Zabell"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27809", "subject": "MATH"}]
