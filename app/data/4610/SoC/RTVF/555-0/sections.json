[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course is the second in a three quarter MFA sequence in which each student focuses on creating a documentary media thesis project, whether a 12-20 minute film, an installation, a work of interactive media, or some other configuration. Students will engage in continued production of the thesis project, with emphasis placed on transitioning from working in the field (production) to assemblage (post-production) is expected. All shooting or prototype construction will be finished by the end of quarter, when students are required to present works-in-progress to their thesis committee for feedback/evaluation. During class meetings we will chiefly focus on viewing and critiquing our works-in-progress, sharing and analyzing questions and concerns of the production and post-production process, studying and applying the creative processes of other media artists, and engaging with critical readings and discussions. Students will come out of the class with a rough or fine cut that will be further polished in Thesis III.", "name": "Thesis 2", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "555-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 9:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/RTVF/555-0/22376", "instructor": ["John Paul Sniadecki"], "id": "22376", "subject": "RTVF"}]
