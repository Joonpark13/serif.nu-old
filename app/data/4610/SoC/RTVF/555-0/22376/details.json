Students will engage in continued production of the thesis project, with emphasis placed on transitioning from working in the field (production) to assemblage (post-production) is expected. All shooting or prototype construction will be finished by the end of quarter, when students are required to present works-in-progress to their thesis committee for feedback/evaluation. During class meetings we will chiefly focus on viewing and critiquing our works-in-progress, sharing and analyzing questions and concerns of the production and post-production process, studying and applying the creative processes of other media artists, and engaging with critical readings and discussions. Students will come out of the class with a rough or fine cut that will be further polished in Thesis III."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
