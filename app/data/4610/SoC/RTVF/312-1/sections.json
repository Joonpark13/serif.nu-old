[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course surveys the history of international cinema from its emergence through the 1930s.  The course explores the diverse forms cinema took and functions it performed during this formative period by looking closely at a range of films and writings about them.  We will examine the industrial, social, and historical contexts within which these films were produced and experienced as well as key theorizations of cinema that emerged concurrently with them.  The course thus introduces students to the study of film history as well as to key national and international trends in making and thinking about cinema as it rose to prominence as a vital component of the art and culture of the twentieth century.<br/> <br/>Topics covered include the cinema of attractions; the development of narrative filmmaking in the United States and Europe; the studio systems of Hollywood and Japan; exhibition practices; the concept of national cinemas as exemplified by the cinemas of France, Germany, and the Soviet Union; the avant-garde and cinema's relation to art movements; the coming of synchronized sound; documentary cinema; and diverse conceptualizations of cinema's political possibilities and dangers.", "name": "History of Film I", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "312-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 1:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/RTVF/312-1/22284", "instructor": ["Ariel Rebecca Rogers"], "id": "22284", "subject": "RTVF"}]
