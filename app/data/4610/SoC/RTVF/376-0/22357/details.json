The course aims to distinguish between how video games extend traditions of artistic exchange and how they offer novel and unexplored modes of communication unique to the medium. The course is designed to engender an active and critical perspective on what games are and how they relate to other cultural texts through analysis, discussion, production, and play. Students will have the opportunity to conceptualize their own game projects and select from a menu of approaches in order to resolve them. Students will be evaluated through active participation, individual exercises, reading responses, presentations, and unit projects in group critique. The course is designed for students with no prior game making experience, although students with experience are welcome to enroll."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "By the end of the quarter students should have a strong understanding of contemporary developments in game production.
