In this course, we will investigate the affordances of existing and emerging digital environments. We will explore the use of these affordances for designing interactive stories. We investigate the ways of designing interactive stories or interactive art pieces that make use of the procedural power of digital media thus giving the participant (player, user) maximum agency."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "We will read and discuss interaction design and expand our understanding of interaction design through analysis of digital and non-digital artifacts (films, novels, performance pieces, installations, and games). Participants will present one of the assigned texts and a artifact.<br/> <br/>Participants will design, implement, and present one short interactive narrative or art piece in any interactive medium they choose. I will teach the basics of Adobe Flash and ActionScript 3 and QR codes which will enable participants to create their project. ActionScript will introduce you to the idea of using code as an expressive medium.<br/> <br/>Participants may choose to collaborate for their Capstone Project."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Students will be evaluated based on their attendance and class participation, as well as 2-3 projects, and a final project."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Janet H.
