A creative process in its own right, documentary editing is the art of giving shape to a chaotic mass of material and guiding the viewer along a narrative and emotional arc.

Major topics we will cover include: systems for organizing footage within your project file, screening and selecting footage, cutting observational scenes, using sound/texture to further the story, navigating the editor/director relationship, and the dilemma of cutting for narrative 'truth' versus cutting for emotional clarity.
