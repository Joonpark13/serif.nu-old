In this class, we will read plays and screenplays that feature the most memorable of antiheroes and sympathetic villains. We will examine the uses (and misuses) of empathy, study how the ethical orientation of central characters impacts a script's plot and structure, and learn how to write our own compelling and morally ambiguous characters. <br/><br/>There will be weekly reading and writing assignments, and each student will complete a treatment and roughly 30 pages of a new play, screenplay, or teleplay."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "?
