We will examine the uses (and misuses) of empathy, study how the ethical orientation of central characters impacts a script's plot and structure, and learn how to write our own compelling and morally ambiguous characters. <br/><br/>There will be weekly reading and writing assignments, and each student will complete a treatment and roughly 30 pages of a new play, screenplay, or teleplay.", "name": "Topics in Media Writing", "section": "20", "location": "Annie May Swift Hall 109", "topic": "Writing the Anti-Hero", "course": "360-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 3:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/RTVF/360-0/22294", "instructor": ["Zayd   Dohrn"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "22294", "subject": "RTVF"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "In this class, we will investigate the complicated relationship between truth and fiction by researching and writing our own \"fact-based\" dramatic scripts.
