The class will entail lecture/discussion, project assignments, and labs. Students will gain a working knowledge of how many documentary and narrative fiction film directors derive stories from actuality. Techniques covered will include: reenactment (interview illustration); collaborative observation (improvisation with actors) and adaptation (inspiration from archival research). In addition, students will become acquainted with essential communication and group dynamic skills that will enable them to complete highly collaborative thesis projects. Emphasis will be placed on developing your voice as a storyteller and creating works characterized by simple yet effective visual, aural and narrative structural elements."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Students will be graded on three individual projects, all produced in small working groups, plus attendance/participation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "?
