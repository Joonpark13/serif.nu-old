We will cover an array of techniques including basic 2D animation, text and title manipulation, motion &amp; planar tracking, 3D animation (including virtual 3D lighting), virtual camera tracking, keying and compositing, particles and emitters. <br/> <br/>You will make a presentation, work on several in-class exercises, complete a moderately-sized project, and complete a final exam project (there will be no written exam). There is the likelihood of some quizzes to make sure you are keeping up with the material.<br/> <br/>This will be a technical and somewhat dense class. Fair warning: if you are not a patient person who likes tweaking details until they are just right, or if you are not fluent in Mac and enjoy working with complex software, the class may not be for you. If you do enjoy these things, you will have a lot of fun.<br/> <br/>I would like to create a workshop atmosphere - I expect you to be leaning over to watch each other's computers, checking different approaches and techniques, asking questions out loud rather than raising your hand, finding new and different approaches online and sharing them with the class, and generally helping each other along. This does NOT mean chaos - making noise and conversation where it is not helpful."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "The required text is After Effects Apprentice: Real-World Skills for the Aspiring Motion Graphics Artist by Chris and Trish Meyer.
