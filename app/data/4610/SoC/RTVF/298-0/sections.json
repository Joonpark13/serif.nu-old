[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "How does the construct of genre aid the filmmaker in finding their voice? How might it hinder? Students will research a variety of cinematic genres, then utilize them to develop original narrative-based story premises. <br/><br/>Students will generate their own genre-based, original, feature-length and short film concepts based on weekly prompts given in class. Each student will leave the course with an idea book filled with 27 ideas for future projects that they have workshopped in class and revised.<br/><br/>The class will meet twice weekly. Wednesday will be for workshop and discussion of ideas/concepts. There will be a film screening every Thursday that will be a prompt for the next genre we will examine.", "name": "Studies in Media Topics", "section": "20", "topic": "Applying Genre", "course": "298-0", "meeting_time": ["We 6:00PM - 8:50PM", "Th 5:00PM - 7:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/RTVF/298-0/22283", "instructor": ["Erik Steven Gernand"], "id": "22283", "subject": "RTVF"}]
