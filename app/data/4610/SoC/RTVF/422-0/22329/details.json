We examine the development of ideas about texts, textuality, and analysis in the context of Euro-American?especially French?cine-semiotics in the 1970s; the methodological self-consciousness of early textual analysis; and the limits and possibilities of an &quot;anti-interpretive&quot; analytic position. We also consider the vicissitudes of textual analysis in relation to questions of media history, theory, ideology, and reception. Some of the guiding questions for the class: What was textual analysis? What is it (or could it be) now? What is the object of analysis in textual analysis? How do you do things with texts?"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Required Texts: Roland Barthes S/Z; (many) other required readings will be available as a reading packet."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
