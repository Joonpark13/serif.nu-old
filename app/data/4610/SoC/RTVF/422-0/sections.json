[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This class explores textual analysis in relation to screen studies.  We examine the development of ideas about texts, textuality, and analysis in the context of Euro-American?especially French?cine-semiotics in the 1970s; the methodological self-consciousness of early textual analysis; and the limits and possibilities of an &quot;anti-interpretive&quot; analytic position.  We also consider the vicissitudes of textual analysis in relation to questions of media history, theory, ideology, and reception.  Some of the guiding questions for the class:  What was textual analysis?  What is it (or could it be) now?  What is the object of analysis in textual analysis?  How do you do things with texts?", "name": "Textual Analysis", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "422-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 5:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/RTVF/422-0/22329", "instructor": ["Miriam B White"], "id": "22329", "subject": "RTVF"}]
