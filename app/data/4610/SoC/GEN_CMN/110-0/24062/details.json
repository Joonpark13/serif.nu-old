Individual vocal problems are analyzed and remedial work prescribed. As vocal skills develop the focus will include connecting the speaking voice to the sounds of English and their relationship to meaning through the use of poetry and selected text. Final will consists on bringing all the elements covered in the class together for a group performance of selected poetry performed on the stage."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Voice for Performance by Linda Gates with accompanying double CD. <br/> Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary<br/> Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by T.S.
