[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "The course asks the question: How are stories and storytelling central to our lives and to human communication? We will explore how storytelling performances reflect our families, communities, culture, and nation. To engage the power and significance of storytelling performance we will focus on three units:  (1) Oral Narrative. Students will learn how to conduct in-depth interviews, on a particular topic, to gather oral narratives and their meanings from specific family, friends, or community members. (2) Myth. Students will read and discuss ancient and contemporary myths to unravel deeper questions about local and global experiences. (3) News Reports. Through guided instruction students will select a current news story, from electronic or newspaper journalism, they feel reveals an urgent issue they are compelled to share. Each of the three units will culminate in a performance: a solo performance of an oral narrative, a group performance of a myth and, finally, a multi-media group performance of a news story. The course is highly interactive and performance based. The unifying thread and overarching question for the course is: How does storytelling performance and creative communication help us better engage and illuminate our world and the world of others, e.g., identity, family, community, nation, social relations, political institutions and economic orders?", "name": "Performance Culture and Communication", "section": "21", "location": "Annie May Swift Hall 103", "topic": "", "course": "203-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/GEN_CMN/203-0/20508", "instructor": ["Eddie   Gamboa"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "20508", "subject": "GEN_CMN"}]
