What it feels like, kinesthetically and emotionally, to let the body's weight and motion<br/>give in to, not resist, the downward-pulling force of gravity. (&quot;The more we let go of our physical weight, the more we let go of our emotional weight.&quot;)<br/><br/>2. What it feels like, kinesthetically and emotionally, to use active relaxation as the springboard to vocalizing and moving in a focused forward-directed way. (&quot;Go down to go forward.&quot;)<br/><br/>3. What it feels like, kinesthetically and emotionally, to engage the four primary <br/>emotional articulators of the body - the hands, eyes, and voice - as the primary initiators for meeting a character's objectives. (&quot;Getting what you want.&quot;)<br/><br/>In short, Standing Down Straight aligns with Stanislavski's instruction (which he notes in the &quot;Relaxation&quot; chapter mentioned above) that acting students remain vigilant about not engaging &quot;superfluous, harmful tenseness&quot; or &quot;tense muscles&quot; when working.<br/><br/>Classwork will culminate in final projects consisting of a scene, either solo or with a partner, that incorporates the ideas covered in this class, especially those based in the 3 states of kinesthetic and emotional awareness described above under &quot;About the alignment concept called ?Standing Down Straight'.&quot; In tandem with whatever vocalizations the scene asks for (spoken, sung, non-verbally expressed), the scene will involve, if the text calls for it, the manipulation of an object or objects and moments involving hands-on interactions with your scene partner. NOTE: The term &quot;scene&quot; can be defined as you wish broadly as you wish. Here are some options: <br/><br/>-playwright-written monologues (edited if you wish), or self-written monologues;<br/>-playwright-written partnered scenes (edited if you wish), or self-written partnered scenes; <br/>-composer-written songs performed solo (edited if you wish), or self-composed solo-performed songs; <br/>-composer-written songs with partner (edited if you wish), or self-composed partnered songs; <br/>-other, outside-the-box, fused voice-movement forms of your own devising, performed either solo or with partner."}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/DANCE/335-0/22272", "instructor": ["William Lewis   Siegenfeld"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>No Freshmen<br/><br/>", "id": "22272", "subject": "DANCE"}]
