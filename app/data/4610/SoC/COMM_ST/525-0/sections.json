[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This seminar provides a historical overview of theories of International Communications since the post World War II period. As Everett Rogers suggested in his history of the field of Communication, it was through International Communications that our field began to gain authority, funding, and a disciplinary foothold in the US academy.  Dating back to modernization theory and going through successive approaches and critiques such as dependency, world systems, transnational, postcolonial, neo-liberalism, and contemporary approaches to &quot;globalization&quot; this seminar will proceed through major signposts in the field to explore the enduring influences that date back to the nineteen forties and some of the ruptures that represent the changing, yet not totally different, contemporary world communications order.  Class time will be a combination seminar and development of research projects for students.", "name": "Seminar-Problems in Comm Studies", "section": "20", "topic": "Bargaining &amp; Negotiation", "course": "525-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/COMM_ST/525-0/26444", "instructor": ["Michael Elwood   Roloff"], "id": "26444", "subject": "COMM_ST"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Graduate Seminar: Computational Social Science<br/>Winter/Spring Quarters (0.5 credit in each quarter or 1 credit in either quarter), 2015-16<br/> <br/>Noshir Contractor, Northwestern University<br/>Joseph N.

Each registering students is required to attend at least thirteen (13) of the sixteen (16) scheduled meetings. Given the three-hour meeting time of the seminar, that will generate 39.0 hours of instructional time at each participating institution. The formal meeting dates will be bookended with an optional kickoff meeting and an optional closing meeting. See a complete schedule below, including weeks by coordinating faculty member, topic areas, and tentative guest speaker.  <br/> <br/>Structure:  After the introductory session when we discuss goals and explore points of collaboration, each participating faculty member will be responsible for programing five sessions, with a commitment to lead at least one session and secure four leading researchers in the domain of computational social science as speakers.  Northwestern will handle the technology support, with each participating unit securing a room with a large monitor (for simulcasting), a conference calling center, and a webcam (for interaction),  Each weekly session will have one hour dedicated to hearing a presentation from a distinguished researcher on the topic, followed by an hour of Q&amp;A and joint discussion that will include the presenter, the participating faculty, and the students from each institution.
