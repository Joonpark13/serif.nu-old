As Everett Rogers suggested in his history of the field of Communication, it was through International Communications that our field began to gain authority, funding, and a disciplinary foothold in the US academy. Dating back to modernization theory and going through successive approaches and critiques such as dependency, world systems, transnational, postcolonial, neo-liberalism, and contemporary approaches to &quot;globalization&quot; this seminar will proceed through major signposts in the field to explore the enduring influences that date back to the nineteen forties and some of the ruptures that represent the changing, yet not totally different, contemporary world communications order. Class time will be a combination seminar and development of research projects for students."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:38 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
