Can memes lead to political change? Are American jokes the &quot;secret agents of globalization&quot;? What can YouTube parodies teach us about gender and identity? From the earliest days of internet use, humor played a key role in content circulation. This course examines how technology affects humor, the role web-based humor plays in contemporary society as well as the key theories, fields, challenges and opportunities researchers face when probing online humor. We will explore different aspects related to online humor by looking at its position in globalization processes, marketing campaigns, social transgression, political expression, and the performance of social identities. Using a combination of readings and writing exercises students will develop a proposal for an original research project addressing a question pertaining to the use, circulation, reception or expressive characteristics of online humor."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "there is no textbook"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:38 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
