[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course will examine the 1970s TV show An American Family. After shooting 300+ hours of 16mm film, this long-form documentary was edited to 12 hours that were broadcast on Thursday nights at 9pm on PBS. Although the show has been called the grandfather of reality television, it was actually shot in the cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 filmmaking form. <br/><br/>An American Family is an ethnographic representation of family on television, that had never been seen before. There were over 10 million viewers fascinated by the Loud family who had 5 children. The show was also heavily criticized and became extremely controversial as it dealt with one son who was openly gay living in NYC-and a marriage that was on the rocks, in 1971. The ultimate impact of the show was that it was a groundbreaking look into the life of a regular, but not regular, family living in the United States. <br/><br/>As we examine the show, we will consider how marriage and family is reflected; how being homosexual is reflected; and whether this representation truly looks at what life was like in a family in the early 1970s. We will also look at the form of the show, and how it has become a text for looking at life and family-as well as the entertainment business in the 1970s. Furthermore, we will analyze how it might affect our outlook today on these issues. Throughout the course, we will watch the show and discuss readings about the show and related interpersonal communication topics. The final project will be a research paper that students will create and workshop throughout the quarter.", "name": "Communication Studies Research Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute M349", "topic": "Gay life & Divorce, 70s-style", "course": "394-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 3:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/COMM_ST/394-0/27611", "instructor": ["Jennifer Lindsy Baker"], "class_attributes": "Juniors Only<br/><br/>", "id": "27611", "subject": "COMM_ST"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "LOLs, deconstructed: Issues in the research of web-based humor. Can memes lead to political change? Are American jokes the \"secret agents of globalization\"? What can YouTube parodies teach us about gender and identity? From the earliest days of internet use, humor played a key role in content circulation. This course examines how technology affects humor, the role web-based humor plays in contemporary society as well as the key theories, fields, challenges and opportunities researchers face when probing online humor. We will explore different aspects related to online humor by looking at its position in globalization processes, marketing campaigns, social transgression, political expression, and the performance of social identities. Using a combination of readings and writing exercises students will develop a proposal for an original research project addressing a question pertaining to the use, circulation, reception or expressive characteristics of online humor.", "name": "Communication Studies Research Seminar", "section": "22", "location": "Annenberg Hall G29", "topic": "LOLs, Deconstructed", "course": "394-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 3:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/COMM_ST/394-0/27341", "instructor": ["Lillian Aviva Boxman"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>Juniors Only<br/><br/>", "id": "27341", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
