[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Digital media create a marketplace where an endless number of options compete for a limited supply of public attention - an environment where building audiences is a prerequisite for making money or exercising influence. This course explains how the preferences and habits of media users, the strategies and constraints of media makers, and the growing prevalence of media metrics form a dynamic marketplace that shapes public attention.
