Expressing no regret over their decision to forsake career for motherhood, these women stuck to their guns about the &quot;feminist&quot; aspect of their decisions. Around the same time, another article proclaimed that 60% of polled Yale female undergraduates expected to pursue a career until age of 30 and then become full time parents.  Many claimed that they had witnessed the failure of a generation of feminist women (ie their mothers) to &quot;have it all.&quot;  Considering the cottage industry of &quot;back to the home&quot; and &quot;DIY&quot; books?novels, nonfiction, manuals, cookbooks, how-to kits, blogs, websites, etc.?notions of motherhood have changed in the wake of neo-liberalism. How can we understand these changes? Positioning the current debate about women, caregiving, parenthood, and career alongside its earlier waves, this course will examine what some have called the crisis in care work.  Paying close attention to the rhetoric of &quot;choice&quot; as it has informed feminist work engaged with this debate, our course will trace the genealogy of motherhood debates from its 1950s instantiation to the present.  Reading such classic second-wave authors as Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Susan Brownmiller, Germaine Greer, Sylvia Plath, and Kate Millet, our course will offer an historical, sociological, literary, and economic background for the resurfacing of &quot;motherhood&quot; as an unmediated ideal. Key to our discussions will be the peripheralization of race and sexuality in these debates, and the correctives offered to this by the intervening years of 1970s black feminist scholarship. Our examination will of necessity include an investigation of masculinity and its corresponding invisibility in early discussions of parenting.", "name": "Topics in Communication Studies", "section": "21", "topic": "Motherhood and its Discontents", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/COMM_ST/395-0/26386", "instructor": ["Kate A Baldwin"], "id": "26386", "subject": "COMM_ST"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "The full course title is &quot;Outside the Classroom: Popular Education in the 19th Century United States.&quot; We will ask: How did nineteenth-century Americans create intellectual culture?

In this course we will study the theoretical dynamics and practical parameters of education in the nineteenth-century United States, with a special focus on how people who lacked access to formal educational institutions found ways to learn. We will read scholarship from communication, history, and American studies and will analyze many primary source materials, such as widely circulated textbooks, posters advertising public lectures, and the unpublished minutes of debating clubs and literary societies.
