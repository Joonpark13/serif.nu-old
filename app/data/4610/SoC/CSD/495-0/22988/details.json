Students are not entitled to make-up assignments or to grades of Incomplete unless the instructor has approved such arrangements in advance. <br/>[ ] Students are expected to comply with University regulations regarding academic integrity. Relevant information can be located on the University's web page. If you are in doubt about what constitutes academic dishonesty, speak to the instructor before the assignment is due and/or examine the University web site. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating on an exam (e.g., copying others' answers, providing help to others, using a crib sheet) or plagiarism of a paper or exercise (e.g., taking material from readings without citation, copying another student's work). Failure to maintain academic integrity on an assignment will result in a loss of credit for that assignment, at a minimum. Other penalties may also apply.<br/>[3 ] The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) privacy rules went into effect as of April 14, 2003. As you know, these rules provide federal protection for the privacy of health information and give clients of CSD clinics certain rights regarding the release of their health information maintained by the clinics. This is a reminder that, as a CSD student, you are obligated to understand and abide by the terms of both the School of Communication, Communication Sciences and Disorders, and the Notice of Privacy Practices and HIPAA Policies &amp; Procedures. It is particularly important that you refrain from disclosing any information regarding any client of the CSD clinic, the Aphasia and Neurolinguistics Research Laboratory, and/or any individual with aphasia who may visit the class to any third party without the express permission or approval of the appropriate clinic director or professor if related to the research laboratory or this class.
