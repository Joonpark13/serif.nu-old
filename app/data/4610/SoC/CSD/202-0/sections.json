Basic mechanisms underlying the function of the nervous system beginning with single cells and progressing up through simple reflexes to more complex functions related to speech-language-hearing will be addressed.  Sensory systems including the auditory, visual and somatosensory systems will be discussed in context to their relevance to communication and communication disorders.<br/> <br/>Registration Requirements: No prerequisites.<br/> <br/>Learning Objectives:<br/>Upon completion of the course students will be able to:<br/>Describe mechanisms of neuron action potential generation and propagation.<br/>Describe mechanisms of synaptic propagation.<br/>Describe mechanisms of muscle contraction.<br/>Describe the mechanisms underlying simple reflexes.
