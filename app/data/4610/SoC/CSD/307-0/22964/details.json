Why does the speech sound the way it is? What are the roles of articulators in shaping speech sounds? In this course we will focus on some of these questions under the umbrella of the source-filter theory. <br/><br/>We will begin by laying a foundation of the basic acoustics: study fundamental properties of sound waves, types of sound sources and resonant properties of the oral cavity. We will then develop tools for analyzing speech signals. We will next learn about auditory representation of speech sounds as it relates to perception, properties of vowels and consonants, speech in context, prosodic features, perception and hearing loss. <br/><br/>At the conclusion of the course, students will be able to:<br/>1. Summarize the Acoustic Theory of Speech Production, including source and filter components and their interactions.<br/>2. Relate how listeners interpret acoustic properties of sounds in order to recognize speech and discuss how these are different in clinical populations.<br/>3. Relate ways in which acoustic measures could be used as methodological tools in the study of normal and disordered phonology as well as pre-post treatment measures. <br/>4. Apply concepts of acoustic features and perceptual saliency in explaining diagnostic findings.<br/>5. Generate and interpret visual and numerical acoustic data related to voice and speech production, using appropriate equipment and computer software. <br/>6. Compare acoustic features of consonants and vowels under conditions of relative isolation and naturalistic speech, including stress and intonation.<br/>7. Describe categories of vowels and consonants according to their frequency, intensity, and temporal features.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Texts:<br/>\u00b7 Johnson, K.
