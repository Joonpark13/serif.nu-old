Such prostheses include cochlear implants, bone conduction implants, middle ear implants and auditory brainstem implants. Some of these devices are capable of providing access to sound to individuals who have hearing loss that is too severe for hearing aid amplification. Other devices are designed for individuals with less severe hearing loss and can provide additional benefits over traditional amplification. The goal of the course is to provide the student an opportunity to learn about the development of these technologies, to understand the technical aspects of each device and to consider the advantages and disadvantages of each with regard to candidacy criteria, management and outcomes.
