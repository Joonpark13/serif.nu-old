Approaches to the collection and analysis of data will be addressed, as well as the use of that data for therapy planning. <br/> <br/>-<br/>Registration Requirements: <br/> <br/>Narrow phonetic transcription skills and understanding of speech physiology. <br/> <br/>-<br/>Learning Objectives: <br/> <br/>1. Understand normal speech sound acquisition.<br/>2. Demonstrate an understanding of assessment procedures and analytic tools for performing diagnostic procedures related to developmental speech sound disorders. <br/>3. Develop intervention plans to address developmental speech sound disorders with consideration of phonetic versus phonemic approaches, treatment efficacy, motor learning principles, as well as other various treatment approaches. <br/> <br/>-<br/>Teaching Method: <br/> <br/>The course will include lectures and lab activities. <br/> <br/>-<br/>Evaluation Method: <br/> <br/>Grades will be based on lab activities and three in-class exams. <br/> <br/>-<br/>Class Materials (Required): <br/> Bauman-Waengler, J.
