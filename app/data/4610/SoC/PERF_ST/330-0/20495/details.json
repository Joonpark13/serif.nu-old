How have black women been staged? How have they staged themselves? What stages have black women dominated? What stage is &quot;black womanhood&quot; in? Drawing from historical accounts, theoretical texts, and contemporary popular culture, we will consider the stages of the auction block, the concert venue, the sidewalk, the courtroom, and television to think through and against the sexual and resistive politics regarding the portrayals of black women."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
