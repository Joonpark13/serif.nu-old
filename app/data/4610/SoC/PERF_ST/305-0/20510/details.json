How has performance has been theorized and, in turn, how does theory influence the study and making of performance. We will focus in particular on theories of the body in performance with attendant attention to the histories and traditions of performance art and body art. In addition to key texts from performance studies, we will engage literature from the adjacent fields of critical race theory, feminist theory, queer theory, disability studies, and postcolonial theory."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
