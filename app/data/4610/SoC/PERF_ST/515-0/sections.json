[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Performance Studies has long hosted debates about the ontological nature and epistemological implications of performance. In turn, these debates have amplified methodological questions regarding approaches to studying performance: How does one study performance (insofar as it is ephemeral) or the live body in performance (which may evade documentary capture)? Does performance stand opposed and against the archive and in what ways do archives perform? Focusing on theories of the body, and of the body in performance in particular, this course will ask how the performing body functions as an archive as much as we will explore the archive as a means for researching performance. Theorists studied may include Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, Hortense Spillers, Fred Moten, Beatriz Preciado, Daphne Brooks, Amelia Jones, Diana Taylor, Tavia Nyong'o, Alexadra T. Vazquez, Lauren Berlant, Peggy Phelan, and Jean-Luc Nancy. Each student will undertake a research project based in an archive of their own choosing.", "name": "Seminar: Problems in Performance Studies", "section": "23", "topic": "", "course": "515-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/PERF_ST/515-0/20505", "instructor": ["Joshua Takano Chambers-Letson"], "id": "20505", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
