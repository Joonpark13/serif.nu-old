It exposes the student actor to a variety of Shakespeare's plays through in-depth text analysis, rehearsal and performance of monologue and scene work, primarily utilizing the First Folio of 1623. <br/>Students learn to use the First Folio Technique as a tool to discovering Shakespeare's inherent clues about performance, comparing and contrasting the Folio with other editions of Shakespeare's plays in order to make their own well-informed, personal choices for performance. <br/>This course is a continuation of the student actor's journey through the acting sequence at Northwestern University. The class is designed to enable the student actor to fully inhabit Shakespeare's characters in a personal and believable way, embodying his language with clarity, imagination and passion."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
