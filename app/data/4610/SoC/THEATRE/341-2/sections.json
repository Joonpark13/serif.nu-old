It exposes the student actor to a variety of Shakespeare's plays through in-depth text analysis, rehearsal and performance of monologue and scene work, primarily utilizing the First Folio of 1623. <br/>Students learn to use the First Folio Technique as a tool to discovering Shakespeare's inherent clues about performance, comparing and contrasting the Folio with other editions of Shakespeare's plays in order to make their own well-informed, personal choices for performance. <br/>This course is a continuation of the student actor's journey through the acting sequence at Northwestern University.  The class is designed to enable the student actor to fully inhabit Shakespeare's characters in a personal and believable way, embodying his language with clarity, imagination and passion.", "name": "Acting II: Analysis and Performance", "section": "22", "location": "Wirtz Center STRUB", "topic": "", "course": "341-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/THEATRE/341-2/24092", "instructor": ["Henry Dominic Godinez"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "24092", "subject": "THEATRE"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "Acting II: Analysis and Performance", "section": "23", "location": "Wirtz Center SOUTH", "topic": "", "course": "341-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/THEATRE/341-2/24093", "instructor": ["David S Catlin"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "24093", "subject": "THEATRE"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "Acting II: Analysis and Performance", "section": "24", "location": "Wirtz Center WALLIS", "topic": "", "course": "341-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/THEATRE/341-2/24094", "instructor": ["Dawn A Mora"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "24094", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
