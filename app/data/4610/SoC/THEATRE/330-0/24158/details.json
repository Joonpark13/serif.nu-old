Through in-class solo and group performances, listening assignments, and style comparison papers, the class will expand the student's knowledge of Rodger's &amp; Hammerstein's catalog. Everything from OKLAHOMA! and CAROUSEL to CINDERELLA and THE SOUND OF MUSIC will be covered. All performances will be workshopped on vocal technique and performance practice. The focus of this course is not audition technique, but rather establishing an in-depth knowledge of Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's work."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
