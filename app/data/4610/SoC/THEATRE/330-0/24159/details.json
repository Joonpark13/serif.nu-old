These songs are assigned by<br/>era sequentially so that we may simultaneously introduce the context of this material<br/>within the genre-at-large. You will also apply your growing knowledge of technique and<br/>context to intelligently observe and comment on the work of your peers within a<br/>structured setting. Throughout the course we will incorporate short group exercises to<br/>better explore performance technique and promote a deeper understanding of the<br/>differences between traditional script/text analysis and score/lyric analysis.
