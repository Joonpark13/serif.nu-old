In particular, Standing Down Straight for Actors takes inspiration from what Konstantin Stanislavski said in An Actor Prepares:  &quot;[T]he organic bases of the laws of nature on which our art is founded will protect you in the future from going down the wrong path.&quot; (AAP 16).&quot;  For examples of such nature-driven art, Stanislavski suggests, in the chapter fittingly called &quot;Relaxation,&quot; that we observe what &quot;small children and animals do.&quot;  His reasoning:  all of their actions come across as - to use the two adjectives that course through his writings - not only &quot;natural&quot; but as &quot;truthful.&quot;  Natural, because when small children or animals are hungry or in danger, or exhausted, etc., they use their bodies (specifically, as focused on in this course, the body's primary expressive, goal-getting tools, the hands, eyes, and voice) to take the most direct route to satisfying their appetite.  Truthful, because animals and human infants especially don't conceal or lie when in the grips of an appetite.
