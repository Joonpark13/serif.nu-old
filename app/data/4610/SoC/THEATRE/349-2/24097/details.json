This class will build on the Checkov/ Modern Drama section in the 3rd quarter of junior year, and take a closer look at Ibsen's innovative and deeply compelling plays. Our work throughout the quarter will focus on Ibsen's The Master Builder, the basis for a new work currently in development: The Master Comic. This class will use the meteoric rise and tragic fall of Bill Cosby as a basis for The Master Comic to examine race, respectability politics and contemporary definitions of success. This class is open to actors, writers, writers who act and actors who write. The Master Builder Project: The Master Comic is the winner of a 2015 Ibsen Scholarship, awarded at The International Ibsen Conference in Skein, Norway. The annual conference addresses existential and society-related subject matters concerning Henrik Ibsen and his plays."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Henrik Ibsen: The Master Builder, Enemy of the People<br/>David W.
