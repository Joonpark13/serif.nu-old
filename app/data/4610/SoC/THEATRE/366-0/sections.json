From the 1970s until today, her plays have challenged conventional conceptions of gender, politics, and power, and they have done so in ways that have challenged and enlarged conventional conceptions of theatre.  In this class we will analyze all of her major plays, and quite a few of her not-so-major ones.  We will also place her in her historical context, by comparing her work to that of her forebears such as Brecht and Artaud, to that of her contemporaries in the Joint Stock Company, such as David Hare and Howard Brenton, to selected films and major historical developments of her time, and to the theoretical discourses that have most informed her work, Marxism and feminism.", "name": "Special Topics in History", "section": "22", "location": "Locy Hall 110", "topic": "Caryl Churchill", "course": "366-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 10:30AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/THEATRE/366-0/27388", "instructor": ["Charles C Harmon"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27388", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
