Engaging with various theories and definitions of adaptation, appropriation, and intertextuality, class content will focus on the interconnectedness between various texts and genres (from script to stage, to screen, to choreography, etc.). From Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet to Jerome Robbin's West Side Story, students will examine the issues and ideologies that fuel adaptation and its reception. Through readings and viewings (both live and recorded), other course content will include case studies in fiction, poetry, musical theater, dance theater, film, and various digital media. Like all Theatre 140-2 courses, this course introduces students to university-level research-paper writing that incorporates performance analysis and secondary sources. Using resources available in the library and techniques discussed in class, students will design, research, and complete a final paper concerning theatrical adaptation."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "introduction to university-level research paper"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
