In addition to exploring &quot;authenticity,&quot; students will link production choices from the adaptation to foundational moments in the source text's production history. We will investigate the power dynamics that contribute to a canonical text becoming considered as such, and how this canonicity is leveraged in the choice to adapt. Students will advance (or begin) the necessary skills of navigating archival material and developing a coherent, scholarship-backed argument."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
