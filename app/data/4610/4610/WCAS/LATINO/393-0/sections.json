[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will examine some of the exciting and innovative Latina/o literary works produced since the beginning of the new millennium, including novels by Junot Di\u00e1z and Luis Alberto Urrea, short stories by Joy Castro, a memoir by Carmen Gim\u00e9nez Smith, and poetry by Rosa Alcal\u00e1 and US Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera. Latinidad as an umbrella category comprising many diverse groups, each with its own history and cultural traditions, is a relatively recent phenomenon. But how did this group come into existence as a social phenomenon, let alone as a literary field? In addition to considering this question, we will pay special attention to how the works we study portray relationships among different US Latino groups and between Latinos and other US ethnic and minority groups. The tensions between the internal divisions of latinidad and its lateral affiliations make this body of literature vital for anyone interested in understanding the complexity of twenty first-century American racial formations.", "name": "Topics in Latina and Latino Text and Representation", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 122", "topic": "21st Cent Latina/o Literature", "course": "393-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/LATINO/393-0/24763", "instructor": ["John Alba Cutler"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "24763", "subject": "LATINO"}]
