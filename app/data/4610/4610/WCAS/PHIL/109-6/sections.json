In this course, we will read Homer alongside Plato in order to think about the value of literature and the substantive ethical ideals represented in these two authors. Is literature good for us? If so, how? Is it dangerous to read literature that puts forward a bad ethical model? What value, if any, do myths have in helping us to understand the world? What is it to be courageous? How do we understand courage within and outside of war?
