[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The Rise of the Criminal Organization: Gangs and Organized Crime in International and Comparative Perspective<br/><br/>What most people know about gangs and organized crime comes from representations in popular culture such as The Godfather, Breaking Bad, and The Wire.  By demystifying the criminal underworld, this seminar introduces students to the complex social phenomena underlying the rise of criminal organizations.  Students will learn to use a case study approach to compare and contrast different international cases of gangs and organized crime.  We will specifically focus on the social processes, which explain the development of criminal organizations by:  (1) tracing the importance of social networks, (2) situating their practices within existing cultural structures, (3) examining their participation in legal and illegal markets, and (4) interrogating their relationship to politics and other social institutions. <br/><br/>Enrollment is open to all students regardless of major.  Students will address a real world problem at a sophisticated level for their final project and present their research to the class at the culmination of the course.", "name": "Integrating Project Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 121", "topic": "The Rise&Fall of Criminal Orgs", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/INTL_ST/395-0/23425", "instructor": ["Brittany Michelle Friedman"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "23425", "subject": "INTL_ST"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "International Studies 395: Governing Religion in the Middle East: Minorities, Rights, and the Rule of Law<br/><br/>\"Is This the End of Christianity in the Middle East?\" Eliza Griswold's July 2015 New York Times headline typifies a growing interest in how states across the Middle East manage religious pluralism. While observers suggest that religious minorities are at greater risk of persecution due to the global rise of Islamist political movements, there is little discussion of the historical conditions that constituted minority status long before such movements became a phenomenon. Students will use readings from political science, history, legal studies, anthropology, and popular culture to think critically about the nation-state and the concept of \"minority,\" a term which emerged historically only after World War I. This seminar will focus on the colonial and contemporary histories of religious rights, citizenship, nationalism, and sectarianism in Egypt, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq, and will draw on comparative cases beyond the region.", "name": "Integrating Project Seminar", "section": "21", "location": "University Hall 218", "topic": "Governing Religion in the Middle East", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/INTL_ST/395-0/23426", "instructor": ["Mona   Oraby"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "23426", "subject": "INTL_ST"}]
