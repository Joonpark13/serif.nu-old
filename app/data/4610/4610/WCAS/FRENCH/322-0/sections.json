[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course explores the evolution of love as a theme in French literature during the High Middle Ages (c. 1000-1300). Although French literature during this period is notable for the dazzling variety and richness of its subjects, love stands out as a central, even dominant theme in every literary genre. Why were medieval readers and writers so invested in theorizing, analyzing, praising, condemning and simply representing the experience of falling in love? What did love mean for medieval people? How do literary descriptions of love help us to understand the historical evolution of emotion and desire, marriage, family and the self? We will focus in particular on the phenomenon of \"courtly love,\" asking how narratives that depict intense, often illicit sexual desire might reflect changing political and social dynamics, as well as emerging notions of individuality, sexuality and gender.
