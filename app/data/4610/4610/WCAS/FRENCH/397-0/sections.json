[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The Invention of Modernity: The nineteenth century is the time when modernity is invented. Nowhere is this more obvious than in Paris of the Second Empire. In this course we will read literary texts spanning the entire nineteenth-century and that represent some of the hallmarks of modernity. We will start with a discussion of social mobility and the way it is mapped onto spatial mobility in Balza'c P\u00e8re Goriot. We will then move to the second half of the century and study poetic and prose texts by Baudelaire that deal with the phenomenon of the crowd as well as with the role and place of the artist in modern, urban society. We will continue with the issue of consumer culture as depicted in Zola's story of the birth of the department store, Au Bonheur des dames and will end with two stories by Maupassant, \"Le Horla\" and \"Qui sait\" that treat the question of rationality vs irrationality.", "name": "Studies in Literature and Culture", "section": "20", "location": "McMillen Crowe Hall 4-130", "topic": "The Invention of Modernity", "course": "397-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/FRENCH/397-0/23292", "instructor": ["Michal Peled   Ginsburg"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>Reading, writing, speaking proficiency<br/><br/>Seniors Only<br/><br/>", "id": "23292", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
