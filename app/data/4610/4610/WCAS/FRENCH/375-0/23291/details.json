Among the directors whose works will be discussed are Robert Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Tati, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Alain Resnais, Chris Marker, Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne and Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Midterm/final; class participation."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
