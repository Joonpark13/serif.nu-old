[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "French Materialist/Marxist Theory: This introductory course on problems in contemporary critical theory will begin by focusing on critique of ideology in the Marxist tradition (with particular attention to Sartre, Althusser and Jameson, along with some of their major predecessors, allies and adversaries, including such thinkers as Eisenstein, Barthes, Bataille and Derrida). We will then discuss how the relationships between discursive, institutional and aesthetic practices and their pragmatic effects are rethought in the writings of such theorists as Foucault, Ranci\u00e8re and Deleuze. While the primary focus of the course will be on theoretical texts, these texts will also be considered in dialogue with literary and cinematic works.", "name": "Topics in Literary Theory", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L06", "topic": "Materialist/Marxist Theory", "course": "493-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 7:00PM - 9:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/FRENCH/493-0/23319", "instructor": ["Scott P Durham"], "class_attributes": "Given in English<br/><br/>", "id": "23319", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
