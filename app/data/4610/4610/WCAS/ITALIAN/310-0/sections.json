[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, we will explore a strategic selection of the most compelling poetry, drama, essays, and narrative fiction of the Italian tradition.  We will start with a selection from Dante's Divine Comedy (which will be accompanied by videos of Roberto Benigni's recitations of La Commedia) and continue with two novellas from Boccaccio's Decameron.  How differently do these two authors imagine and depict the experience of love?  Advancing to the Renaissance, we will investigate questions of etiquette and power through readings of Giovanni Della Casa's Il galateo and a selection of chapters from Machiavelli's Il principe, while keeping in mind the influence of the latter text in particular on modern political philosophy.  We will also read and watch recordings of two plays: Goldoni's La locandiera and Dario Fo's Mistero buffo.  Finally, we will read \"La figlia oscura,\" a short novel by Italy's latest literary sensation, Elena Ferrante, while discussing the frenzy of journalistic attention that recently has gathered around her work, particularly in the US.", "name": "Reading Italian Literature (in Italian)", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 110", "topic": "", "course": "310-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ITALIAN/310-0/23323", "instructor": ["Alessia   Ricciardi"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "23323", "subject": "ITALIAN"}]
