The synthesis of Maxwell's equations unified electricity, magnetism and light, laying the foundation for modern technology and modern physical theories. This non-calculus based course explores: charges, electric and magnetic forces, electrical potentials, batteries, circuits, capacitance, induction and inductance, and finally electromagnetic radiation. Demonstrations of many physical principles will be shown in the lecture whenever possible. Weekly quizzes emphasize problem solving. The course goals focus students on developing an understanding of the nature of the physical principles; these fundamentals govern the world around us and the universe beyond, viewed through models which draw on our everyday experiences. <br/>Topics:<br/>1. Charge and Matter<br/>2. The Electric Field<br/>3. Gauss's Law<br/>4. Electric Potential<br/>5. Capacitors and Dielectrics<br/>6. Current and Resistance<br/>7.
