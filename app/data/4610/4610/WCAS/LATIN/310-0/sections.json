[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will focus on the relationship between literature and politics in the Neronian age. The primary materials will consist of a close reading of Seneca's Apocolocyntosis, supplemented by significant portions of Seneca's De Clementia.  While conducting a literary and historical analysis of these texts, students will address two fundamental questions: How does the literature composed and published in the time of the emperor Nero reflect the dominant ideology of the principate? To what extent does it reveal a social and political dissent, as well as an intellectual opposition to the imperial regime, its constraints and degeneration? Selected passages from the lives of Claudius and Nero, as portrayed by Suetonius and Tacitus, will allow us to place our readings in their historical context.", "name": "Readings in Latin Literature", "section": "20", "location": "555 Clark 230", "topic": "Literature & Power in the Age of Nero", "course": "310-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/LATIN/310-0/25256", "instructor": ["Francesca   Tataranni"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "25256", "subject": "LATIN"}]
