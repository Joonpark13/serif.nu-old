For example, early life exposure to cultural goods associated with the elite classes is thought to influence education and occupational outcomes later in life. This course considers the profound intersection between social class and culture, with a special emphasis on gender and sexuality. We will explore the way that socioeconomic status intersects with gender norms, and how sexual communities and practices reflect social class patterns."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "During preregistration this course is only open to Sociology Majors &amp; Minors. <br/>This course is open to all students during regular registration starting November 16, 2015."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "All readings will be available on Canvas - no purchase necessary."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
