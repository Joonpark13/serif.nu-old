[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course provides an introduction to thinking about food from a sociological perspective.   We will gain an initial understanding of how different social forces have shaped and continue to shape the way we grow, distribute and consume food, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world.  We will look at the role played by culture and politics, as well as economics, in shaping our past and present food system.  At the same time we will gain an initial understanding of concepts central to sociology, such as the social construction of seemingly natural choices involving the food we eat, or how social inequality affects such choices.  Through looking at the issue of food, we will also become acquainted with different areas in sociology, such as the sociology of health and medicine, and development and globalization.", "name": "Food & Society: An Introduction", "section": "20", "location": "Fisk Hall 217", "topic": "", "course": "211-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/SOCIOL/211-0/23969", "instructor": ["Susan L Thistle"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "23969", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
