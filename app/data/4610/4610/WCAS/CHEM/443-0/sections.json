[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will be focused on a practical approach to chemical kinetics and dynamics. It begins with basic rate laws and moves to rate laws for complex reactions, temperature dependence of reaction rates, a discussion of potential energy surfaces for reaction, models for reactions in the gas phase and solution and a development of the theory of unimolecular reactions, and finally partition functions and transition state theory. If time allows we will also cover catalytic reactions.", "name": "Kinetics", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute L158", "topic": "", "course": "443-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/CHEM/443-0/24264", "instructor": ["Lin X Chen"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "24264", "subject": "CHEM"}]
