[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course you will study advanced techniques of synthetic inorganic chemistry including synthesis of zeolites, MOFs, and bioinorganic compounds and use of a Schlenk line. In addition, you will learn instrumental analysis techniques relevant to analysis of samples in materials chemistry. These techniques will include X-ray crystallography, solid state NMR spectroscopy, electrochemistry, atomic spectroscopy, and a variety of polymer characterization techniques (MALDI-TOF MS, NMR spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, DSC). Some of these analytical techniques may be used to analyze the inorganic samples you prepare in the course.", "name": "Advanced Laboratory 2", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute M120", "topic": "", "course": "350-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 9:00AM - 9:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/CHEM/350-2/24333", "instructor": ["Frederick J Northrup", "Shelby   Hatch"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "24333", "subject": "CHEM"}]
