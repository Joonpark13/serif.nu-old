In this course, students will learn about common human brain disorders, their cellular and molecular causes, and treatments. We will cover a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, ADHD, depression, mental illness, mental retardation, and other disorders. Students will synthesize this information to identify common mechanisms underlying brain diseases. We will discuss how the causes of brain disease were discovered and what we don't yet know. Ethical questions in neural medicine will be addressed. Class format will consist of lectures twice a week plus a third weekly session consisting of student presentation and discussion of primary research articles to develop the skills to read and critique current research in the field."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites: 202 and 306, or BIOL SCI 302 or 311 or consent of instructor."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "A.
