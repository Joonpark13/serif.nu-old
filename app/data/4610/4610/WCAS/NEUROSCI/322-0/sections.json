[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Have you ever wondered how networks of neurons in the brain process and store information? How can seemingly simple network units, like single neurons, combine with each other to form small groups capable of rich computations and behaviors such as integration, feature detection, self-organization, and information storage? We will take a computational approach to answering these questions. We will cover experimental results and then develop computational models that can reproduce the complex phenomenon and provide a more detailed understanding of them. By modeling single neurons as network units and then connecting the units together in specific patterns, we will show how complex activity patterns can arise. The course will begin with a short introduction reviewing the basics of neuroscience, we will then learn the Matlab programming language and review basic mathematical principles as they relate to modeling neural networks. Then we will apply these tools to model and understand the following phenomena: reflex responses, insect flight central pattern generator (CPG), Hebbian learning networks, memory recall (and forgetting).", "name": "Systems and Computational Neuroscience", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute M166", "topic": "", "course": "322-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/NEUROSCI/322-0/20876", "instructor": ["Daniel A Dombeck"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "20876", "subject": "NEUROSCI"}]
