Each lecture tackles a fundamental question best answered by studying the nervous system at the cellular and molecular level, including but not limited to: What constitutes the ?nervous system'? What gives neurons the potential to generate electrical activity? What determines whether a neuron is ?active' or not? How do neurons relay signals? Can communication between neurons be modified? How is the external world transformed into neural activity? How is neural activity transformed into actions? How do neurons make appropriate connections with one another? How is information retained by the nervous system? What happens when neurons fail to communicate normally? The content is designed to provide a strong foundation for students to pursue any specialty within neuroscience."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: BIOL SCI 217."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "1) Fundamental neurobiological principles arising from studies of the nervous system at the cellular and molecular level.<br/>2) History and recent developments in neuroscience research.<br/>3) Methods used to study the nervous system, including specific experimental techniques relevant to cellular and molecular neuroscience, the design, analysis and interpretation of experiments using specific techniques, and the strengths and limitations of those techniques.<br/>4) Ethical issues raised by the growing body of information generated by neuroscience research, including the use of animals."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "The format of the course will be that of a semi-flipped classroom. Instead of hearing information for the first time in lecture, students will read and assimilate the basic material from the textbook prior to class. Lectures will assume a working knowledge of the general concepts covered in the assigned chapters, and then expand upon them, principally by focusing on the techniques and recent advances in the field. Class time will also be used to solve problems and to answer questions. The idea is that the lectures will not only provide new information, but also allow students to discover and remedy misconceptions prior to the exams."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Your final grade will be out of 400 points and is broken down as follows:<br/> Midterm 1 100 points<br/> Midterm 2 100 points<br/> Reading Quizzes 25 points<br/> Participation 25 points<br/> Final exam 150 points<br/>The two midterm exams cover specific lectures. The final exam is semi-cumulative (it will focus on the last set of lectures, but questions and concepts may be pulled from the entire course). You will be given 2 hours for each exam. Exams will be given on paper. Answers must be written on the paper exam and entered into your clickers for electronic submission. Please contact your assigned TA with grading questions."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain (4th Ed.), ISBN: 9780781778176"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "WCAS Distro Area I - Natural Sciences"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:51 PM (CT)", "subject": "NEUROSCI"}]
