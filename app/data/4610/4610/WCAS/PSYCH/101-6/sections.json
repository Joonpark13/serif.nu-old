[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The overall goal is to introduce you to research on culture and decision making. We make decisions all the time and you might think that, by now, we should all be experts at it. This course will examine people's decision making from a variety of perspectives, all of which, in one form or another, are based on psychological research on decision making. In addition to asking how our decision making might be improved we will consider whether there are distinct types of decisions (e.g. business versus love), whether people in different cultures use different decision making processes as well as whether decision making is or should be a rational process. Each student will write a research proposal in the domain of culture and decision making and present it in class. Research is a cooperative enterprise and each person's job will be to help us come up with high quality projects. The cultural model for our class will be to be a community of learners.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "Swift Hall 231", "topic": "Culture and Decision Making", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/PSYCH/101-6/20922", "instructor": ["Douglas L Medin"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>Freshmen/Sophomores Only<br/><br/>", "id": "20922", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
