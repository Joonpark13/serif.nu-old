[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will be a comprehensive survey of social psychological theory. We will first consider the role of theory in science, and also the qualities that characterize the most useful theories. Then we will examine the different types of theoretical principles that social psychologists use to predict and explain human social behavior. We will consider different levels of theoretical analysis (ranging from the neurobiological level to the cultural level) and the major \"themes\" of social psychological theory (i.e., the cognitive, affective, motivational, and behavioral principles that have been offered as explanations of human behavior). The interplay of characteristics of both the person and the social situation in shaping behavior will be a prominent theme.", "name": "Theories in Social Psychology", "section": "20", "location": "Swift Hall 210", "topic": "", "course": "481-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/PSYCH/481-0/21020", "instructor": ["Galen V Bodenhausen"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "21020", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
