We will first consider the role of theory in science, and also the qualities that characterize the most useful theories. Then we will examine the different types of theoretical principles that social psychologists use to predict and explain human social behavior. We will consider different levels of theoretical analysis (ranging from the neurobiological level to the cultural level) and the major &quot;themes&quot; of social psychological theory (i.e., the cognitive, affective, motivational, and behavioral principles that have been offered as explanations of human behavior). The interplay of characteristics of both the person and the social situation in shaping behavior will be a prominent theme."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Graduate Standing"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Students will be required to write weekly reaction papers and one longer theoretical analysis."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "No textbook is required.
