[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will cover the history of the United States from 1968 to the present, a period that scholars and journalists have described with words like \"fracture,\" \"realignment,\" and \"new order.\" This is an era that has not yet been fit into a standard historical narrative, and the course will consider the ways in which it continues or disrupts more familiar subjects like the Cold War, globalization, the politics of race and gender, environmental crisis, political partisanship, and cultural conflict. This will be primarily but never exclusively a lecture course; students will have many chances to participate directly.", "name": "The United States Since 1900: Late 20th C. to Present", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall 107", "topic": "The United States Since 1968", "course": "315-3", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/315-3/24929", "instructor": ["Keith Mako Woodhouse"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "24929", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
