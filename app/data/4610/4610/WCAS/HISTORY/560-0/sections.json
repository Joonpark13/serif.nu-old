[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar will serve as an introduction to pedagogy for graduate students in history. It is designed to offer practical advice regarding the challenges of conceptualizing a course and writing a course description; compiling syllabi for lecture and seminar courses; leading discussions; organizing lectures; and grading. We will also consider how one might devise an actual teaching philosophy, not simply to compile a document for an employment dossier, but to plan a pedagogical agenda that will guide instructors during the early stages of their careers.", "name": "Teaching History", "section": "1", "location": "University Hall 412", "topic": "", "course": "560-0", "meeting_time": ["We 4:00PM - 6:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/560-0/25073", "instructor": ["Melissa A Macauley"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "25073", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
