We will interrogate the concept of diaspora versus migration versus immigration, and the different notions of identity implicit in each framework (diasporic community, sojourner, etc.). We will examine the immigration policies of host countries in Europe, the Americas, and Asia, and the settlement histories of Asians within these countries. We will discuss notions of group belonging and ideas of citizenship, nationality and ethnicity, and also compare how different ethnic groups and different national societies have handled ethnic/racial/cultural diversity. We will, in short, be examining the crossing and construction of multiple borders, the cultural encounters and the mixings, of various Asian groups in various socioeconomic and political contexts in different nation-states."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "DiscussionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendanceClass participationPapersPresentationsAttendance and participation (10%), presentations and leading short discussions (20%), three short papers (30%), term project(40%)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Lok Siu, Memories of a Future Home, Stanford UP 2005, ISBN: 978-0804753024<br/><br/><br/>Viranjini Munasinghe, Callaloo or Tossed Salad?
