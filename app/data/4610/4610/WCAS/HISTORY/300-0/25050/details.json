No musical training is necessary to enroll in the course, however we will think about how to analyze musical sound as &quot;text.&quot; More crucially, we will focus on the cultural, social, political, and economic dimensions (the &quot;context&quot;) of genres ranging from Tin Pan Alley to blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, country, folk, soul, rock, disco, hip-hop, and classical. We will explore popular music as an art form, a business, an activity of identity-making, a phenomenon encompassing both conflict and consensus, and a key area in the life of Americans. Students are expected to attend lectures, discussion sections, and complete all reading, listening, and viewing assignments. There will be three short essays in the course focused on using a song, a performer, and a genre to analyze the broader cultural history of the US. There will also be a number of shorter assignments."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion sectionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationThree five to seven page essays and related essay worksheets, participation"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Larry Starr and Christopher Waterman, American Popular Music: From Minstrelsy to MP3, 4th edition Oxford University Press, ISBN-13: 978-0199859115<br/><br/><br/>Selected articles online<br/><br/><br/>Listening Mixes online/Music Library<br/><br/><br/>Video/Film Viewings online/Multimedia Center."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "HISTORY AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Americas"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
