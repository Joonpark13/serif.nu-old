Is the government truly representative of the people's will? American voters are currently asking themselves these questions?but not for the first time. This course will examine the period from the 1870s to the 1930s to see how previous generations of Americans asked and answered these same questions. We will pay particular attention to the ways in which activists sought to control utility companies?the largest corporations of that time?through ambitious and innovative state regulatory commissions. We will see how the rhetoric developed by progressive reformers and their opponents during these decades continue to inform American politics today. This seminar will provide students the opportunity to examine primary sources from the Progressive Era, in addition to scholarly histories of that time."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationPapersResponse papers and participation"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "The Search for Order, 1877-1920 by Robert H.
