[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The seminar will grapple with the way in which Soviet citizens tried to make sense of what went on around them during the 1930s, a decade in which several million peasants died after their farms were collectivized, millions of innocent people were sentenced to forced labor in the Gulag prison camps, and another million or so were executed for political crimes they had not committed.  We will read documents, diaries, and memoirs written during the 1930s but not published until much later.", "name": "First-Year Seminar-European History", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 312", "topic": "Stalinism", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/101-6/24895", "instructor": ["John Starkes   Bushnell"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>Freshmen/Sophomores Only<br/><br/>", "id": "24895", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
