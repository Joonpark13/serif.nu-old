The course begins with a study of traditional (mainly Ottoman) institutions; it then traces the forces which weakened those institutions and examines the efforts of Middle Eastern leaders to resist or encourage change. The second half of the course focuses on the period since World War I. It examines the origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the significance of secular ideologies such as Arab nationalism and socialism, the successes and failure of the Nasser regime in Egypt, the rise of Islamism, the Iranian revolution, and the Middle East since the end of the Cold War."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion sectionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Exam, finalExam, mid-termTwo exams- a midterm and a final"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "William L.
