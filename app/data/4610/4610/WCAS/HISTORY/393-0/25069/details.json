In the Middle Ages, whole Jewish communities were routinely massacred in response to accusations of ritual murder and cannibalism. in the modern period, similar accusations have been leveled, with catastrophic results, throughout Europe, the Middle East, and even the United States. Why did belief in religiously inspired ritualized cannibalism, murder, and torture gain and maintain so much traction over such a wide expanse of time? How did accusations against Jews relate to similar charges against heretics, witches, satanic cults, and other marginal groups? This course will trace the origins, diffusion, and surprising persistence of the &quot;blood libel,&quot; and will survey historians' attempts to make sense of this phenomenon. We will analyze a wide array of ancient, medieval, and modern sources (all in English translation), and discuss the continued impact of the blood libel motif on contemporary political and theological discourse."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Paper, finalResponse papers, a final paper, and an in-class presentation"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "HISTORY AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Europe"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
