[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Why is it important that we save significant cultural places, landscapes, practices, and artifacts? This will be the focal question of this class. Through the next 10 weeks we will explore this question and gain a better understanding of what makes something culturally significant and the laws and policies that govern cultural resources such as architecture, historical personages, local history, landscapes and ecosystems, and language and cultural knowledge. This course will explore cultural aspects of environmental resource policy, covering the history of cultural resource management in the United States including the National Historic Preservation Act, language and cultural preservation, Native American sovereignty, mitigating natural resources, cultural patrimony, and Traditional Cultural Properties. We will also discuss ethical issues that arise from multiple perspectives of culturally significant landscapes, places, beliefs and practices. The course will examine the main debates around protecting and preserving cultural and natural resources. Selected case studies will be utilized as both a focus for, and to facilitate, class discussions. Readings will include four books and selected articles relevant to the course.", "name": "Special Topics in Environmental Policy and Culture", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute LG72", "topic": "Cultural Res Mgmt and Evn Pol", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 10:00AM - 11:30AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ENVR_POL/390-0/27837", "instructor": ["Eli S Suzukovich III"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "27837", "subject": "ENVR_POL"}]
