We will cover their discovery and role in the history of sciences, physical characteristics, recent probes and findings, as well as theories for their evolution and tectonic activity. Also included, planning for future missions to outer solar system satellites to understand the formation of our solar system and additionally the search for life beyond the terrestrial planets.
