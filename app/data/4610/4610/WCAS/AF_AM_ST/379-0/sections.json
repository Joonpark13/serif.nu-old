The course will not be a traditional literature course.  Rather it will weave Black women's writing in history, political economy, and sociology with autobiography, poetry, and speculative fiction.  The class will include units on remembering erased landscapes of slavery, environmental justice, Hurricane Katrina, and Black women writing on the future of human/ non-human relationships.", "name": "Black Women Writers", "section": "20", "location": "2122 Sheridan Rd Classroom 232", "topic": "", "course": "379-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/AF_AM_ST/379-0/26462", "instructor": ["Jessica   Quizar"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "26462", "subject": "AF_AM_ST"}]
