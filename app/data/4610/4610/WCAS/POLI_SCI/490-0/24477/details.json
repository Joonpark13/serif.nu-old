Working under the weight of the ruptures and crises of identification that constitute contemporary feminist theory this seminar has two main overlapping aims. The first is explanatory/investigative: It's geared toward gaining knowledge of the complexity of central categories of feminist analysis and understanding (e.g. &quot;gender&quot; [and &quot;binary&quot;], &quot;sex,&quot; &quot;sexuality,&quot; &quot;women,&quot; &quot;woman,&quot; &quot;m/f,&quot; &quot;the feminine,&quot; &quot;patriarchy,&quot; &quot;family,&quot; &quot;lesbian,&quot; &quot;race,&quot; &quot;class,&quot; &quot;identity,&quot; &quot;kinship,&quot; &quot;oppression,&quot; &quot;desire,&quot; &quot;nation,&quot; &quot;power,&quot; &quot;freedom,&quot; &quot;politics&quot;) through the interpretation of texts. Without organizing things strictly chronologically much less seeking any sort of linear narrative of &quot;development,&quot; we'll consider transformations, changes, and tensions that mark (mostly western) feminist theoretical perspectives and discourses from roughly the 1970s to the present. Although we'll be considering general theoretical approaches (e.g. Marxist; lesbian materialist; feminist standpoint; critical theoretic; black feminist/oppositional consciousness; intersectional; postcolonial/subaltern; poststructuralist; psychoanalytic; linguistic; deconstructive; genderqueer; transnational) the focus will be on the particular texts and writers and on reading them in ways that disrupt the standard theoretical positions they are presumed to represent. These writers include among others: N Alarc\u00f3n; S Ahmed; E Barkley Brown; R Braidotti; W Brown; J Butler; N Chodorow; K Crenshaw; N Hartsock; J Kristeva; L Irigaray; A Lorde; C Sandoval; H Spillers; G Spivak; C MacKinnon; B Martin; G Rubin; R Wiegman; L Zerilli. The second aim of the seminar is critical/diagnostic/programmatic: It's concerned to bring the texts and thinkers we're reading into constant and productive tension with each other, not only with a view toward exposing the limitations, misrepresentations, and exclusions that shadow all modalities of feminist thought post-Beauvoir and within &quot;the progress narrative of gender&quot; but also with an eye toward imagining new beginnings (praxis) that generate fruitful political, social, possibilities for feminist theory and action in late modernity."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Graduate students in Political Science only Attendance at first class required; no P/N option; no auditors."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "A range and variety of contemporary post-Beauvoir feminist theories, methods, and approaches to problems and basic structuring concepts of gender, sex, sexuality, &quot;women,&quot; race, class, nationality, and ethnicity, as well as debates and contestations across the field among various perspectives and approaches (e.g. materialist, standpoint, poststructuralist, psychoanalytic, African-American, black, critical theoretic, post and decolonial, deconstructive, transnational, queer, transgender)."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar Style: Seminar discussion focused on textual materials; student paper presentations"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Three 2 pp &quot;Wordbooks&quot; (due every other week); 10-15 pp Final paper (due end of quarter); 1 Seminar set-up and presentation session; Seminar attendance and general participation"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity.
