[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Race and Modern Political Theory, Winter 2016, Professor Alvin Tillery<br/><br/>This course introduces students to philosophical debates over the nature of the race concept, race relations and racial justice in contemporary political theory. The course will explore the following core questions: How have contemporary political theorists conceptualized the race concept and racial difference? How do contemporary political theorists see the relationship between democracy and racial inequality? What theories of racial justice have emerged in contemporary political theory? The course will examine the works of theorists ranging from the late nineteenth century to the rise of the critical race theory movement in the late twentieth century.", "name": "Special Topics in Political Science", "section": "21", "location": "Scott Hall 201 Ripton Room", "topic": "Race and Modern Political Theory", "course": "490-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 10:00AM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/POLI_SCI/490-0/24475", "instructor": ["Alvin Bernard Tillery"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "24475", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Prof. Reuel Rogers,\"Race and Political Behavior\" Winter 2016 <br/>This course explores key concepts, methodological issues, and debates in the research on race and American political behavior.", "name": "Special Topics in Political Science", "section": "22", "location": "Scott Hall 107 Burdick Room", "topic": "Race and Political Behavior", "course": "490-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/POLI_SCI/490-0/24476", "instructor": ["Reuel R Rogers"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "24476", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Prof. Mary Dietz \"Advanced Feminist Theory\" Winter 2016<br/>If the generative moment of contemporary feminist theory can be traced to Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949), then the past sixty-five years to the present constitute a truly turbulent epoch for feminist theorizing and feminist political discourse, given the contestations that have engulfed the academic field ever since Beauvoir declared \"One is not born a woman but becomes one.\"  Under the sway of what R Wiegman calls \"the progress narrative of gender\" some of feminism's core concepts, perhaps particularly the subject \"women\" (or \"women\") itself, are seemingly up for grabs, theoretically, politically, and disciplinarily. Working under the weight of the ruptures and crises of identification that constitute contemporary feminist theory this seminar has two main overlapping aims. The first is explanatory/investigative: It's geared toward gaining knowledge of the complexity of central categories of feminist analysis and understanding (e.g. \"gender\" [and \"binary\"], \"sex,\" \"sexuality,\" \"women,\" \"woman,\" \"m/f,\" \"the feminine,\" \"patriarchy,\" \"family,\" \"lesbian,\" \"race,\" \"class,\" \"identity,\" \"kinship,\" \"oppression,\" \"desire,\" \"nation,\" \"power,\" \"freedom,\" \"politics\") through the interpretation of texts. Without organizing things strictly chronologically much less seeking any sort of linear narrative of \"development,\" we'll consider transformations, changes, and tensions that mark (mostly western) feminist theoretical perspectives and discourses from roughly the 1970s to the present. Although we'll be considering general theoretical approaches (e.g. Marxist; lesbian materialist; feminist standpoint; critical theoretic; black feminist/oppositional consciousness; intersectional; postcolonial/subaltern; poststructuralist; psychoanalytic; linguistic; deconstructive; genderqueer; transnational) the focus will be on the particular texts and writers and on reading them in ways that disrupt the standard theoretical positions they are presumed to represent. These writers include among others: N Alarc\u00f3n; S Ahmed; E Barkley Brown; R Braidotti; W Brown; J Butler; N Chodorow; K Crenshaw; N Hartsock; J Kristeva; L Irigaray; A Lorde; C Sandoval; H Spillers; G Spivak; C MacKinnon; B Martin; G Rubin; R Wiegman; L Zerilli. The second aim of the seminar is critical/diagnostic/programmatic: It's concerned to bring the texts and thinkers we're reading into constant and productive tension with each other, not only with a view toward exposing the limitations, misrepresentations, and exclusions that shadow all modalities of feminist thought post-Beauvoir and within \"the progress narrative of gender\" but also with an eye toward imagining new beginnings (praxis) that generate fruitful political, social, possibilities for feminist theory and action in late modernity.", "name": "Special Topics in Political Science", "section": "23", "location": "Scott Hall 201 Ripton Room", "topic": "Advanced Feminist Theory", "course": "490-0", "meeting_time": ["We 3:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/POLI_SCI/490-0/24477", "instructor": ["Mary Golden Dietz"], "class_attributes": "Graduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "24477", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "Special Topics in Political Science", "section": "24", "location": "McMillen Crowe Hall 4-134", "topic": "", "course": "490-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:30PM - 5:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/POLI_SCI/490-0/25171", "instructor": ["Robert A Orsi"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "25171", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
