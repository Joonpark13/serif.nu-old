How do we know what we know about human rights abuses? In this course students will consider the relationship between the documentation of human rights abuses and justice. In our examination we will question: on what does the will to address human rights depend? And, how do the international narratives that emerge of human rights abuses relate to the victims and survivors of those abuses? Students will be introduced to the international human rights framework and then focus on the practice of human rights through case studies on the prosecution of sexual violence in international courts, the advocacy campaign to end the warehousing of refugees in camps and the struggle to recognize FGM as a form of persecution. We will question the received wisdom about the role of human rights in struggles for justice and learn about tensions between human rights and national sovereignty, the role of advocacy groups and the challenges of localizing human rights. Students will be introduced to the methodologies and tools of human rights documentation and consider the challenges of thinking as a human rights advocate. Based on our study of research and writing about rights, students will develop and share their own research projects."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "1.
