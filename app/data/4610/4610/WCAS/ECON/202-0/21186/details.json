We will study the behaviour of individuals and firms in a world of limited resources, and the interactions between the two in many different markets. With an emphasis on economic principles, students will be introduced to core terminology and modes of analysis for studying the production and distribution of goods and services in the economy. An overarching goal is to gain insight into how, when, and why markets fail or succeed. Specific topics include gains from trade, supply and demand, elasticity, externalities, costs of production, perfect competition and monopoly.<br/><br/>This course is aimed at potential economics majors and students who are curious about having a better understanding of the popular press, or analyzing and comparing different government policies. The economic analysis and thinking can be valuable for your education throughout college and subsequent professional career."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Confidence applying high school algebra tools (graphs, equations, and tables), and high-school uni-variate calculus materials."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "The goal of this course is to give the students an introduction into the tools and skills that economists use, as well as a solid understanding of economic concepts related to:<br/>?
