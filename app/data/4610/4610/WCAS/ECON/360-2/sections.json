[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The goal of this course is to introduce students to the issues involved in forming a portfolio of securities.  In particular, by the end of the quarter, students should be familiar with the existing set of financial instruments and the related terminology, have an understanding of the tradeoffs facing investors, and have the ability to evaluate alternative investment strategies. Much of the course will rely heavily on statistics and economics and their applications in real-world finance are emphasized.  Topics related to personal investing and (single) security selection may be touched on, but the primary focus of the course is on the creation of optimal portfolios of securities. Topics include portfolio selection, asset pricing models, tests of market efficiency, performance evaluation and fixed-income securities. If time permits, additional topics such as derivatives and hedging may be introduced.There will be 5-6 problem sets including case write-ups. Students are encouraged to work on the problem sets in small groups.", "name": "Investments", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G21", "topic": "", "course": "360-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ECON/360-2/21268", "instructor": ["Masako   Ueda"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "21268", "subject": "ECON"}]
