[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is concerned with the specification and estimation of causal relationships between economic variables, and with inferences about these relationships. It begins with a brief survey of basic statistical concepts,  introduces causal analysis, and follows with an introduction to simple and multiple linear regression. The course will also introduce estimation methods that take into account the endogeneity resulting from the use of observational data that prohibit simpler methods from identifying causal effects.", "name": "Introduction to Applied Econometrics", "section": "20", "location": "Leverone Auditorium Owen Coon", "topic": "", "course": "281-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 4:00PM - 5:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ECON/281-0/21204", "instructor": ["Steffen   Habermalz"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "21204", "subject": "ECON"}]
