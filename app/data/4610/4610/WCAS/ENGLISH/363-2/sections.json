[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The world of Henry James teems with dangerous secrets and social intrigue. As they navigate the hazardous waters of respectable society, James's characters engage in illicit affairs, spread rumors, and betray one another, concealing their pasts and excavating the private lives of others. In this course, we will read short works and two longer novels by James, paying special attention to the secrets and lies that abound in his fiction. As we untangle the enigmatic personal histories and treacherous relationships of his characters, we will examine how the social world of his fiction channels broader questions about cultural identity, including about nationality, gender, and class.  We will also dwell on the parallels between James's representations of social secrets and his aesthetic interest in questions about knowledge, narration, and interpretation.", "name": "20th Century Fiction", "section": "20", "location": "Parkes Hall 223", "topic": "Secrets, Lies, and Henry James", "course": "363-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ENGLISH/363-2/25461", "instructor": ["Maha Zehra Jafri"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "25461", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
