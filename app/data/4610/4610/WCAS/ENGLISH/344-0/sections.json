[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, we will read eighteenth-century fiction about coquettes, prostitutes, and other clever, passionate women who defy eighteenth-century cultural norms. We will encounter Eliza Haywood's protagonist Fantomina?a young lady who adopts various disguises and personae to reinvigorate the desire of her fickle, inconstant lover?as well as characters like Charlotte Lennox's Arabella, a coquette who consumes so much amorous fiction that she interprets the real world around her as though it were rife with the extravagant, far-fetched plots germane to eighteenth-century romances. Given the fact that many of these women learn to renounce their wayward ways at the ends of these narratives, one might be tempted to read these texts as cautionary tales; however, the lessons these texts impart about female desire are far from straightforward. How might these texts' depictions of female ingenuity and resourcefulness serve to critique eighteenth-century morals, conventions, and institutions? And which values and practices in particular do they strive to uphold? In order to tackle such questions, we will familiarize ourselves with texts that articulate what counts as the \"proper\" conduct for women, alongside early feminist texts. As we set these various texts and genres in conversation with one another, we will attempt to understand how dominant views on female desire and agency change over the course of the long eighteenth century.", "name": "18th-Century Fiction", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 318", "topic": "Prostitutes and Coquettes", "course": "344-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ENGLISH/344-0/25458", "instructor": ["Nicholas Pardee Valvo"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "25458", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
