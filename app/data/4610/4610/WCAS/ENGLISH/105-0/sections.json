[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Expository writing is designed for any student who wants a strong introductory course in college-level writing. While all students will further develop their ability to write analytical and persuasive essays, students who are non-native writers of English will have the opportunity to focus on further developing their ability to write these academic essays in English. Because all students will meet regularly with the instructor in individual conferences, non-native English speakers will get individualized attention on writing grammatically correct English prose.<br/><br/>PROJECTS:<br/><br/>Students write three or four extended pieces of expository writing, developing each through a process of planning, drafting, revising, and editing. Students also complete several briefer exercises in which they experiment with specific writing techniques or use informal writing as a tool for exploring ideas.", "name": "Expository Writing", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 218", "topic": "", "course": "105-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ENGLISH/105-0/23146", "instructor": ["Jeanne Elizabeth   Herrick"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "23146", "subject": "ENGLISH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "<br/>With the central aim of helping students learn to write clearly, thoughtfully, and effectively, this course will explore the concept of \"ghost writing\" in Euro-American culture from the seventeenth to twenty-first centuries.

Cultural interpretations of ghosts and haunting go beyond notions of the fictional and supernatural. Ghosts invite us to a seance with our unfinished past, and conjure compelling analytical and methodological tools across the humanities and social sciences. We will ask: what are ghosts, and what are their roles in the development, or the dismantling, of cultural formations? What is the relationship between ghosts and haunting? How has the concept of the ghost changed through history, and how does that history in turn inform our concept of ghosts? We will investigate both the scholarly and popular answers to these questions as well as come up with our own informed answers over the course of the quarter.
