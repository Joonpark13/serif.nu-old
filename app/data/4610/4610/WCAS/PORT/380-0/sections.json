[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will explore selected themes and aesthetic trends in Brazilian literature and film (but mostly film) produced in the 21st century. We will be particularly interested in discussing how in the last decade both literature and film have blurred the boundaries between fiction and documentary, with an increasing emphasis on social and historical issues.  We will first pay close attention to the key moments of social realism in the literature of the 20th century. We will then trace the development of documentary film making, particularly after the 1990's. Although we will pay some attention to film techniques, our major concern will be with narrative strategies and ideological content. There will be intense viewing of (subtitled) Brazilian films.
