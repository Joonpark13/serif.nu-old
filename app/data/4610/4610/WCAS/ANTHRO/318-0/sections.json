[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, students learn about the culture of medieval Europe, c.AD1000-1500, through material<br/><br/>evidence - landscapes, buildings and objects. Among other topics, we will look at the remains of <br/><br/>medieval field systems, villages and hamlets; the houses of peasants and lords; churches great and <br/><br/>small; and pottery and other artifacts.  The course material will be interdisciplinary:  students will look at <br/><br/>the evidence of archaeological excavations, survey of standing buildings, analysis of maps and aerial <br/><br/>photos, and landscape, social, economic and architectural history.  The course will consider Europe as a <br/><br/>whole, but there will be an emphasis on medieval England and her neighbors in north-west Europe.", "name": "Material Worlds of the Middle Ages", "section": "1", "location": "ANTHRO Sem Rm 104 - 1810 Hinmn", "topic": "", "course": "318-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ANTHRO/318-0/25170", "instructor": ["Matthew H Johnson"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "25170", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
