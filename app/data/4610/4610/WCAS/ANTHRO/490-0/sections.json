This ethnography-based course focuses on actors who seek individual or collective rights and <br/><br/>recognition through legal and paralegal means, and the social processes and changes that affect them <br/><br/>through a broad, cross-cultural approach to both \"law\" and \"human rights.\" Case studies concern <br/><br/>refugees, indigenous peoples, political opponents, children and women, religious minorities, and other <br/><br/>marginalized populations. The concept and pursuit of human rights through legal advocacy, <br/><br/>humanitarianism, and individual narrative is considered through international units such as the <br/><br/>European Court, the United Nations, and the World Bank, as well as at local and state levels.
