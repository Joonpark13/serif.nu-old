[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "While North Africa (the Maghreb) is often considered an appendage of the Muslim Middle East, this <br/><br/>Mediterranean region merits study on its own given its French colonial past and its connections to both <br/><br/>sub-Saharan Africa and Europe. This course introduces students to the Maghreb through text and <br/><br/>expressive culture (film and music). Required readings will include one book or its equivalent in articles <br/><br/>per week, drawing from anthropology, creative fiction and non-fiction, and history. Course themes <br/><br/>include multilingualism, gender, law, rural-urban relations, ethnicity, religion, and French colonialism. In-<br/><br/>depth study of Amazigh (?Berber') and rural populations will complement the study of Arab and urban <br/><br/>populations in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Assessments are based on weekly response papers, <br/><br/>participation, discussion facilitation, and a final research paper.", "name": "Peoples of the World", "section": "1", "location": "ANTHRO Sem Rm 104 - 1810 Hinmn", "topic": "Ethnography of N.
