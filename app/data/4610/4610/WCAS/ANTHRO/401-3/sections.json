[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "No nine-week seminar can possibly encompass the breadth of social/cultural anthropology's history, methods, topics, and findings-particularly given widespread disagreements among practitioners. Our particular entr\u00e9e will be the series of topics and debates that have garnered serious interest in the US and UK from the 1970s forward?including work by non-anthropologists that is widely read and cited.  One way of construing course concerns would be as a toolkit for making sense of the current global crisis. We will focus on historical political economy and neoliberal globalization, as well as the explosion of theorizing on race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, public spheres and media, migration, transnationalism, refugee life, and the shifting and increasingly unequal urban and rural lives indexed by all these terms. Nevertheless, we will also focus on the \"classic\" social anthropology of the 1920s-1960s and the fundamental concepts of social organization.", "name": "Logic of Inquiry in Anthropology (Cultural)", "section": "1", "location": "ANTHRO Sem Rm 104 - 1810 Hinmn", "topic": "", "course": "401-3", "meeting_time": ["Th 5:00PM - 8:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ANTHRO/401-3/25117", "instructor": ["Micaela   di Leonardo"], "class_attributes": "Graduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "25117", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
