In this seminar, we will focus on the emergence of Gay Liberation, Women's Liberation and ethnic nationalist movements during this era. In each case, we will read movement newspapers, manifestos, position papers and other ephemera from the period housed in NU Special Collections alongside documentary films and more recent historical accounts. Our readings and discussions will focus on the challenge these movements posed to dominant ideas about gender, sexuality and race during this period. In addition, we will consider their legacies in the present moment and ask how these earlier formulations and demands are used, contested and/or revised in contemporary activism, from the undocumented youth movement to the End Campus Rape and #BlackLivesMatter campaigns."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}]
