[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will introduce students to major texts and events in the development of feminist thought and the women's movement. We will read and discuss the work of key feminist thinkers from 1790-1990, and will consider the importance of Marxist and Freudian analyses for feminist theory. Readings will be contextualized in terms of social, political, and intellectual background. We will explore the emergence of liberal, cultural, socialist-feminist, and radical feminism, and will consider issues of race and sexuality. The course seeks to develop an understanding of why feminism looks the way it does today; in fact, why we must talk about feminisms rather than assume the existence of a single, unified voice or movement. We cannot, however, hope to cover everything, and it is to be emphasized that this is an introductory course. All are welcome, but open minds and a capacity for hard work are pre-requisites. Be ready to do a lot of reading!", "name": "The Roots of Feminism", "section": "1", "location": "Annenberg Hall G21", "topic": "", "course": "230-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/GNDR_ST/230-0/23326", "instructor": ["Anna Margaret Terwiel"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "23326", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}]
