[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF A \"MYSTERIOUS NEW ILLNESS\" AMONG GAY MEN IN THE U.S., HIV/AIDS HAS BEEN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH SEXUALITY. THIS IS TRUE NOT ONLY BECAUSE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF HIV-TRANSMISSION OCCURS VIA SEXUAL CONTACT, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF CLOSE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN SEXUALITY AND MORALITY AND WHAT \"KINDS\" OF PEOPLE AND PRACTICES ARE SAID TO BE MORE LIKELY TO SPREAD HIV THAN OTHERS.  IN THIS COURSE, WE DRAW UPON SCHOLARSHIP IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES TO EXAMINE THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN HIV/AIDS AND SEXUALITY, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.  HOW DID ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN SEXUALITY, DISEASE AND MORALITY SHAPE WHAT WAS KNOWN ABOUT THE SPREAD OF HIV EARLY IN THE EPIDEMIC? HOW HAVE ONGOING EFFORTS TO KNOW, TREAT AND PREVENT HIV SHAPED SEXUAL PRACTICES AND INTIMACIES, AND VICE VERSA? TOGETHER, WILL CONSIDER THE COMPLEX INTERPLAY OF HIV, SEXUALITY AND SCIENCE ACROSS A DIVERSE ARRAY OF TOPICS, INCLUDING:  THE POLITICS OF HIV-RISK CATEGORIZATION; HIV-STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION; SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND ACCESS TO TREATMENT; SEXUAL PRACTICES AND INTIMACIES; AND NEW FRONTIERS IN HIV-PREVENTION, AMONG OTHERS.", "name": "Gender, Sexuality, and Health", "section": "1", "location": "555 Clark B03", "topic": "Sexuality, Bio-medicine, & HIV", "course": "332-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/GNDR_ST/332-0/23341", "instructor": ["Aaron Travis Norton"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "23341", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "How do conceptions of \"health\" relate to ideological assumptions about gender, race, class, and sexuality?  In this course we will explore these questions through a close examination of recent and contemporary activist movements that have attempted to challenge contemporary conceptions of health and models of disease. Case studies will include the 1970s women's health movement(s), feminist responses to the \"epidemic\" of anorexia in the 1980s, and the ongoing reproductive rights/justice movement, ACT UP and AIDS activism, breast cancer, and environmental activism, and mental health activism in the era of psychopharmacology. In each case, we will consider how activists frame the problem, the tactics they use to mobilize a diverse group of social actors around the problem, and their success in creating a social movement that challenges contemporary medical models and the ideological assumptions that inform them. The course also introduces students to recent interdisciplinary scholarship on social movements.", "name": "Gender, Sexuality, and Health", "section": "2", "location": "Parkes Hall 223", "topic": "Gender, Sex & Health Activism", "course": "332-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/GNDR_ST/332-0/23342", "instructor": ["Amy Ruth Partridge"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "23342", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}]
