We will study intersections between narratives and musical expression while exploring the mysterious language of music in the context of German culture. Spanning the works of composers from Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, and Johann Strauss to political chansons and current popular music, an emphasis will be placed on the historical and literary backdrop that inspired the musical works as well as musical characteristics, linguistic elements, and interpretive aspects. Highlights will be a discussion of Beethoven`s Ninth Symphony and Schiller`s poetry, selected renditions of Goethe`s poetry by Schubert and other composers, and we will attend a live performance of Richard Strauss` Der Rosenkavalier at the Lyric Opera on Monday evening, February 8, 2016. We will also look at musical culture in the 20th Century and venture into the world of Liedermacher as well as other popular and experimental music."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "German 102-3 or permission of instructor<br/>Reading, writing, speaking proficiency in German"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "?
