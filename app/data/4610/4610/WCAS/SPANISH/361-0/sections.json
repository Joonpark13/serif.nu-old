[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Pictures in Latin America<br/><br/>This seminar explores the various and peculiar expressions that Andean artists, intellectuals and other cultural producers have used to represent and negotiate the transition from traditional rural societies to modern and overwhelmingly urban ones over the course of the 20th century.  We will focus on literature, visual culture, and music, with attention to the ways in which these cultural manifestations' circulation and political and social affiliations inflect their outlook on what it means to be modern.  As such, this seminar will give special consideration to the roles that race, class, gender, regional identity, and autochthony play in the articulation of modernity in the Andes.", "name": "Latin America: Studies in Culture and Society", "section": "1", "location": "University Hall 112", "topic": "The Cultures of Modernity in the Andes", "course": "361-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/SPANISH/361-0/28119", "instructor": ["Jorge F Coronado"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "28119", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
