Modernismo characterizes by its strategies of cultural appropriation on one side, and of cultural exhibition on the other, as it marks a moment of intense traffic of symbolic and material goods between metropolitan centers, and at the same time, it claims its cultural autonomy. We explore this system of cultural appropriation and creative transformation in Latin American modernista writers chronicles, poetry and travel writing and we consider the Latin American inflexion on such topics as literature and cosmopolitism; the poetic representation of the street and metropolitan cities; the organization of urban leisure; the woman as objet d'art; the metropolitan fascination with subaltern cultures and debates on the production and consumption of mass urban culture.
