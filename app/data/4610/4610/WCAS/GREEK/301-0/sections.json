[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Plato was not only a philosopher, he was also a literary innovator.  The Protagoras is one of his most vivid and entertaining dialogues. Socrates is rousted grumpily from sleep and dragged to see Protagoras, the great sophist, in action. Socrates and Protagoras spar over topics from education to politics to the nature of moral virtue, in front of an audience of major 5th century BC intellectuals.  Protagoras cuts a forceful figure and Socrates' behavior is playful. We will consider how the literary form of the Protagoras complements its arguments, why Plato portrays Socrates and Protagoras as he does, and the cultural background of education, politics and the sophists on display in the dialogue's setting.  Students signed up for Greek 310 will read extensive selections of the dialogue in Greek and less secondary material; readings for Classics 394  are all in English.", "name": "Readings in Greek Literature", "section": "1", "location": "University Library 4770", "topic": "Plato, \"Protagoras\"", "course": "301-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/GREEK/301-0/25292", "instructor": ["John P F Wynne"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "25292", "subject": "GREEK"}]
