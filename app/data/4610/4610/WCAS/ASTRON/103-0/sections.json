[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This class provides an overview of modern astronomy as related to the Solar System and the appearance of the sky seen from the earth. A description of all the major constituents of the Solar System will be given: the Sun, planets, dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. The course will build upon the description of the Solar System to understand the theoretical origin of the Solar System.  Finally, our Solar System will be related to newly-discovered exosolar planets and the course will develop a theory of where to look for life inside and outside the Solar System.", "name": "Solar System", "section": "20", "location": "Frances Searle Building 2407", "topic": "", "course": "103-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ASTRON/103-0/22561", "instructor": ["Farhad Y Zadeh"], "class_attributes": "Natural Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "22561", "subject": "ASTRON"}]
