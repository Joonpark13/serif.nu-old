[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "We will examine four case studies of Jews and Christians engaged in dialogue about their respective religious traditions and communities. The first two case studies are historical: Justin Martyr's dialogue with Trypho, in which the Christian theologian attempts to convince his Jewish interlocutor of the truth of Christianity and Judah Halevi's <i>Kuzari</i>, in which a king evaluates Christianity, Islam, and Judaism through dialogue with representatives of each faith. The third case study is a modern philosophical classic, Martin Buber's <i>I and Thou</i> (1926), in which Buber argues that human beings can be transformed through true dialogue with others and even God. Finally, the course will culminate with consideration of theologian Catherine Cornille's description of the conditions necessary for a meaningful inter-religious dialogue in her 2008 work <i>The Im-possiblity of Interreligious Dialogue</i>. We will focus on developing analytical reading and writing skills while also learning how to talk about our highest values and commitments with those who don't agree with us.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L04", "topic": "Jews and Christians in Dialogue", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/RELIGION/101-6/26820", "instructor": ["Claire E Sufrin"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>", "id": "26820", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
