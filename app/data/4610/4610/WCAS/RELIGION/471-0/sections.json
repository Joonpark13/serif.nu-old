[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "\"Religion\"?as both an object of scientific inquiry and as a distinct and discrete domain of the everyday life of nation-states?is a creation of modernity. Its formation was fundamental to making of modern societies and persons; to the rule of constitutional law; to human rights discourses; to the shape of knowledge across academic fields; and to the fate of immigrants, migrants, and refugees in the context of local and global crises. This course surveys the making of \"religion\" from early modernity to the present through a series of critical soundings of key moments, events, and ideas. Topics will include the religious construction of hierarchies of race, class, and gender; the reformatting of ancient traditions according to new codes; and the invention of \"spiritual\" alternatives to \"religion,\" among them the modern idea of the holy. Readings are both primary and secondary sources. The seminar is intended for students who are not specialists in the study of religion, but want the opportunity to think both critically and expansively about the history of \"religion\" and modernity.", "name": "Studies in History of Religions", "section": "20", "location": "McMillen Crowe Hall 4-134", "topic": "Religion and Modernity", "course": "471-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:30PM - 5:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/RELIGION/471-0/26846", "instructor": ["Robert A Orsi"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "26846", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
