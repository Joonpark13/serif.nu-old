[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "One of the most influential books in world history, the Qur&rsquo;an is believed by Muslims to be the literal speech of God in Arabic. It is recited daily by Muslims throughout the world, transformed into beautiful calligraphy, and venerated as a sacred object. The course explores the text&rsquo;s historical milieu and the life of the Prophet Muhammad, its form and structure, its ethical worldview, its role in the ritual lives of Muslims, how it has been variously interpreted in multiple contexts, as well as critical issues pertaining to the Qur&rsquo;an in the contemporary world. The course proceeds under the premise that understanding the Qur&rsquo;an is an essential aspect of a broad liberal education in the humanities.", "name": "The Qur'an", "section": "1", "location": "Locy Hall 106", "topic": "", "course": "350-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/RELIGION/350-0/26883", "instructor": ["Brannon Dobbs Ingram"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "26883", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
