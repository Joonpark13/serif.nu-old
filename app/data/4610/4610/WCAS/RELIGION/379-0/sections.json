[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "At the center of this class stands one idea that had an enormous influence on world history: that dying can be a conscious religious and political action, and moreover, that dying can be the single most important action that a person will perform in his or her entire life. The roots of this idea are firmly grounded in the ancient world, and it played a key role in the shaping of Christianity and Judaism as we know them today and of the western world more generally. In this class we will get to know some of the critical concepts, perceptions, stories, and traditions that stand behind the idea of martyrdom as it evolved, and we will consider in what ways these concepts and stories still inform the arenas of religion, law, and politics in our own times.", "name": "Topics in Comparative Religion", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L04", "topic": "Dying for God: Sacrifice and Martyrdom in the Anci", "course": "379-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/RELIGION/379-0/26838", "instructor": ["Mira   Balberg"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "26838", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
