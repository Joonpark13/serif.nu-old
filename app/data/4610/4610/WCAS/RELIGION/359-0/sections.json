[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What does it mean to be a ?modern\u2019 Muslim? How might this be different from merely being a Muslim in the ?modern world\u2019? Are there ways in which Muslims have attempted to make modernity their own, as it were, by articulating an ?Islamic\u2019 modernity or modernities? This course attempts to answer these questions by exploring how Muslims have variously engaged, adapted and resisted ?modernity\u2019 in various contexts and locales.
