How have images of Tibet come to encompass everything from a peaceful Shangri-la on the roof of the world to a superstitious backwater in need of liberation? What does liberation mean in the case of Tibet?both as a religious and a political concept? Who is the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet and how has he come to be regarded as a god-king for many Tibetans and a splittist aiming to divide the motherland according to the People's Republic of China? This course will examine the religions of Tibet (primarily Buddhism but also B\u00f6n) with a focus on their significance within Tibetan culture, society, and politics in Tibetan history from the time of Tibet's Imperial Dynasty (7-9th centuries) to the present day.
