[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "<u>Religious Belief and Practice on Screen</u><br/>We will explore the \"religious\" backgrounds and assumptions of films that pose universal ethical questions. In a few cases, <i>Day of Wrath</i> by Carl Theo. Dreyer, for instance, the plot unfolds within a Protestant community. Westerns such as Eastwood's operate within an American Protestant ethos. Catholicism on Film includes Kieslowski's Dekalog and Hausner's Lourdes. Iranian films (A Separation) present underlying conflicts between practitioners of conservative Islam and a secular worldview, each concerned with problems of relationship and responsibility. The Dardennes, reared in the Catholic tradition, mute obvious representations in favor of compassionate humanism (The Son). Petzold's Phoenix exposes the fragility of personal and religious \"identity,\" historical memory, betrayal, and justice after war. A final section comprises anti-war films that simultaneously attract viewers by their seductive beauty and sear the conscience.", "name": "Religion and Film", "section": "20", "location": "University Library Forum Room", "topic": "Religious Belief and Practice on Scree", "course": "371-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:00PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/RELIGION/371-0/26884", "instructor": ["Sara A Vaux"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "26884", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
