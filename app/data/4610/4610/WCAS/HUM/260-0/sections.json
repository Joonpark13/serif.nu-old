[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Alternatives: Modeling Choice Across the Disciplines<br/><br/>This course will offer a cross-disciplinary approach to the concept of alternatives and choices. At any given moment, how many alternatives are possible? Is there really such a thing as chance or choice? On what basis do we choose? How does our understanding of the past affect the future? Can we predict the future? Professor Gary Saul Morson, a specialist in literature, and Professor Morton Schapiro, a labor economist specializing in the economics of higher education, will themselves offer alternative approaches to these questions based on the presuppositions of their respective disciplines.", "name": "Humanities Explorations", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L07", "topic": "Alternatives: Modeling Choice", "course": "260-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HUM/260-0/23391", "instructor": ["Gary S Morson", "Morton O Schapiro"], "class_attributes": "Interdisciplinary Distro - See Rules<br/><br/>Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>See Class Details for Important Registration Info<br/><br/>", "id": "23391", "subject": "HUM"}]
