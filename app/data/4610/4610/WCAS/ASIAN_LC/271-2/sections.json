[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Medieval & Early Modern Japanese Literature: The first stage of modernity came to Japan in the 1600s, with the rise of an urban middle class.  Much of the cultural production of the 17th to mid-19th century reflects the interests of this new social class.  A wide variety of literary genres show the vibrant intellectual, emotional, economic and social life of people testing and expanding the boundaries of the Shogun's political order.   The three distinctive traditional forms of Japanese theater developed in the preceding medieval and new early modern periods:  the mystical masked Noh theater; Bunraku, the masterly puppet theater; and the larger-than-life Kabuki.  The prose fiction of the 17th century writer Saikaku included both stories of love and the world's first business stories.  New forms of fiction came with 18th century ghost stories and satire of Ueda Akinari; and Jippensha Ikku's lively and humorous 19th century accounts of travel along the great Tokaido highway celebrated rising social energy.  Haiku poetry developed under the perceptive guidance of Basho and his successors.  Through these writings, the course traces changes in the consciousness of townsmen during this exciting time period.", "name": "Japanese Literature in Translation", "section": "20", "location": "Fisk Hall 114", "topic": "Medieval and Early Modern", "course": "271-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ASIAN_LC/271-2/22900", "instructor": ["Phyllis I Lyons"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "22900", "subject": "ASIAN_LC"}]
