What counted as desirable knowledge? Who could possess such knowledge, and how was knowledge obtained and shared? In this course we will study the theoretical dynamics and practical parameters of education in the nineteenth-century United States, with a special focus on how people who lacked access to formal educational institutions found ways to learn. We will read scholarship from communication, history, and American studies and will analyze many primary source materials, such as widely circulated textbooks, posters advertising public lectures, and the unpublished minutes of debating clubs and literary societies. Students who complete the course successfully can expect to have a deeper understanding of alternative modes of learning, nineteenth-century U.S. culture, and analytic approaches to the study of communication in history"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Jensen, Robin E.
