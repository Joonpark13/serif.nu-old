As writers of theatre history and performance critique, how do we construct our audiences? Over the course of the quarter we will address canonical moments in the formation of a global theatre history, asking how contemporary concepts of audience formation influence discourses on the theatrical event. Culminating in a student-designed research project, this course mixes lectures, discussion, and in-class writings to explore methods for theatre history performance critique."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
