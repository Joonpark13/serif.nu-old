We will examine the process of acting, and continue to explore the presentation of self and character on stage. Students will participate in exercises to expand their physical, vocal, and imaginative expression. Our work in the winter quarter will further pursue the stimulation of the actor's imagination. We will continue and build off of the observation work of the fall quarter, by allowing what we observe to stimulate imaginative leaps in characterization and actor's analysis. We will respond to other artistic stimuli (photography, art, literature) as a basis for character creation. We will continue to seek insight into various aspects of human nature and the human experience. The fundamentals of our work will include: Ensemble Building, Sensory Perception and Response, Observation, Imagination, Dramatic Character Creation, and Text Analysis."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "-Audition, Michael Shurtleff<br/>-Three Uses of the Knife, David Mamet<br/>-Sanford Meisner On Acting, Sanford Meisner &amp; Dennis Longwell<br/>-Race, David Mamet"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
