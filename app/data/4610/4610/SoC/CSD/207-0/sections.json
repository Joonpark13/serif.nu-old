[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Seminar in Communication Sciences and Disorders: Bilingualism <br/> <br/>Overview of class/Course Description:<br/><br/>The majority of the world population is bilingual or multilingual. Experiencing the world through more than one language impacts not only communication with others, but also how one perceives and processes the surrounding environment. Converging evidence from the growing field of bilingual research reveals that learning, using, and managing two languages has profound consequences for linguistic, cognitive and neural function. Throughout this course, students will consider what it means to be \"bilingual\", and explore how bilingualism shapes human communication, including language development and learning, the production and perception of speech, cognitive function, and neural activity, as well as the perceived benefits and pitfalls of bilingualism from a cognitive and educational perspective.", "name": "Seminar in Communication Sciences & Disorders", "section": "20", "location": "Frances Searle Building 3417", "topic": "", "course": "207-0", "meeting_time": ["We 1:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/CSD/207-0/22962", "instructor": ["Viorica   Marian"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "22962", "subject": "CSD"}]
