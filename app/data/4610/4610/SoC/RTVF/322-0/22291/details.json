Reality TV is a hybrid mode of television, with messy boundaries, and programs that seem at once obvious and opaque, innovative and repetitive, transparent and self-reflexive, superficial and profound, manufactured and spontaneous. The class will engage critical methods to explore the variety of ways one might (or does) enjoy, interpret, and deride reality television programs, sometimes all at the same time; and also consider whether, when, and how these different postures involve imagining whether (or when) programs are made for &quot;us&quot; or &quot;others.&quot; This means considering the programs in terms of formal properties, narrative structure, cultural context, social identity formation, and transmediality, among other considerations. The class will lead to a broad-based understanding of reality TV, and hone critical skills in media analysis.<br/><br/>Class format will be a combination of lecture, discussion, and in-class screenings."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Evaluation methods: class participation, short writing assignments, one paper, and a take-home final exam."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Textbooks: Deery, June.
