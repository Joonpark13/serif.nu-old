Participants will refine their understanding about the conventions and storytelling methods of the comics medium. We will read one graphic novel every week and discuss these texts under the light of additional readings such as representation of race and gender in comics, language and grammar of comics, representation of disability, affordances and conventions of the comics medium, impact of digital media on comics and humor, films remediating comics, comics remediating film. Participants who complete this course will learn to apply meaning making strategies of comics to other mediums such as film, interactive narrative, and computer games. Even though this is a theory-rhetoric-criticism course there will be a few hands on experimentations to stimulate the ideas for a lively discussion. No drawing skills are required. Students will make the readings, participate in class activities, participate discussions, make a group presentation, write compelling questions about theory readings, and will write a 5 pages paper.?"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
