[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This graduate seminar explores the cultural history of new media. Our focus will be primarily on the digital media that tend to garner the label \"new,\" such as the Internet, computer games, and mobile video. However, we will also put pressure on the concept of new media itself by contextualizing our discussion of contemporary media with explorations of the ways in which older media were also once conceptualized as new. Throughout, we will undertake our examination of new media with an eye to the theoretical and historiographical questions raised by such a project. In addition to discussing readings in class, students will give an in-class presentation and write a research paper.", "name": "Cultural History of New Media", "section": "20", "location": "Annie May Swift Hall 109", "topic": "", "course": "413-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 9:30AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/RTVF/413-0/22374", "instructor": ["Ariel Rebecca Rogers"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "22374", "subject": "RTVF"}]
