[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Directors of documentaries typically set out to make a specific film - having in mind its main characters, its general structure, its message, its mood - only to realize in postproduction that the raw footage captured something very different. The editor then becomes the one who mediates between the raw footage and the director's vision. A creative process in its own right, documentary editing is the art of giving shape to a chaotic mass of material and guiding the viewer along a narrative and emotional arc. It is also the art of compromise - in other words, remaining true to the director's vision while communicating to him/her the limitations of the material, as well as turning those limitations themselves into opportunities for creative exploration.<br/><br/>This course is an introduction to major issues in and approaches to editing a documentary film, ranging from the technical to the theoretical. Major topics we will cover include: systems for organizing footage within your project file, screening and selecting footage, cutting observational scenes, using sound/texture to further the story, navigating the editor/director relationship, and the dilemma of cutting for narrative 'truth' versus cutting for emotional clarity. The course will benefit aspiring editors who want an introduction to the craft and aspiring directors who want to better understand the editorial process.", "name": "Advanced Editing", "section": "20", "location": "Louis Hall 118", "topic": "Documentary Editing", "course": "472-0", "meeting_time": ["We 6:00PM - 8:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/RTVF/472-0/27784", "instructor": ["Lindsay Ann Utz"], "class_attributes": "Graduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "27784", "subject": "RTVF"}]
