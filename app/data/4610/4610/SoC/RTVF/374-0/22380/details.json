Throughout the course, we will learn to shoot in ways that activate our whole bodies (and the bodies of others) as we explore strategies that embrace the physicality and sociality of the filmmaking encounter. We will view in-class a range of films by artists such as Maya Deren (cine-dance), Jean Rouch (cine-trance), Leonard Retel Helmrich (one-shot cinema), and Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Verena Paravel (sensory ethnography). Students will engage in practical exercises and critical readings, keep a film journal, and direct a short film as the final project."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
