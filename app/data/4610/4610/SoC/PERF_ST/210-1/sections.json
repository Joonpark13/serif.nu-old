[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course gives students the opportunity to workshop and perform modern and contemporary poetry, beginning with poetry of W. B. Yeats, T.S. Eliot, and Dylan Thomas and continuing across the twentieth century, giving particular attention to soldier-poets, the Beats, the confessional poets, feminist poetry, and other contemporary poets.  Not only will we perform and study poems appearing in Poetry Magazine, founded in 1912, but students can also delve more deeply into other poetic works of their own choosing not found in our anthology.  Some students may want to perform more experimental poems and draw on multi-media to enhance their performances.  Solo and group performances will be encouraged.", "name": "Performance of Poetry", "section": "1", "location": "Annie May Swift Hall 103", "topic": "", "course": "210-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SoC/PERF_ST/210-1/20492", "instructor": ["Carol Simpson   Stern"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "20492", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
