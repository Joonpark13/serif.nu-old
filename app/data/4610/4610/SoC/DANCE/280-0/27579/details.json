This technique course draws on a diversity of approaches to integrating these two elements. The emphasis will be on enhancing a strong technical foundation of vocabulary, execution, clarity, and time in order to work creatively and freely within the form. Rather than focus on isolated elements of the form, we will approach all aspects of tap dance - warm-up, technique, choreography, improvisation, history, theory, and performance - holistically. Consequently, we will work to create tools to improve ourselves as capable, versatile, complete dancers and people. Individual expression amidst an environment of collective participation is the heart and history of tap dance. This course aims to foster development as strong, well-rounded, creative, and thoughtful tap dancers by dancing in relationship to others."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:39 PM (CT)", "subject": "DANCE"}]
