Topics include: Velocities and accelerations of particles relative to any reference frame. Velocity and acceleration differences of any two particles. Relative angular velocities and angular accelerations of coplanar rigid slabs. Two-dimensional rolling. Mass centers and moments of inertia. Dynamics of a general collecton of particles: Linear momentum, angular momentum, and kinetic energy results of Newton's laws. Calculation of linear momentum, angular momentum, and kinetic energy of a rigid body in plane motion. Dynamics problems involving particles and rigid bodies in plane motion.
