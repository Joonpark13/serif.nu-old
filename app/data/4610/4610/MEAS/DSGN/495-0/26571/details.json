Using the building blocks of story as a foundation, the course will cover the art of graphic facilitation, illustrated journey maps, storyboarding, animatics, and narrative video. Deliverables for the first 5 weeks will be completed by hand, the last 5 weeks will use computers to achieve the desired end result. This course will balance rote practice (muscle-building for rapid visualization), a personal inventory of visual elements and shorthand, and the craft of time-based mediums and narrative framing."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:35 PM (CT)", "subject": "DSGN"}]
