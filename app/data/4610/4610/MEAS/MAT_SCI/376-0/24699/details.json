The course will be structured as a series of integrated lecture and discussion sessions that review foundational concepts in nanoscience in the context of recent research breakthroughs. The lectures will be provided by experts from the Center for Nanoscale Materials and Material Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory. Specific topics to be emphasized include nanoparticles, nanomaterial synthesis and nanofabrication, cutting-edge characterization tools, functional nanomaterials, and biological nanomaterials. In addition, promising applications of nanomaterials in areas of energy conversion, medical therapeutics and diagnostics, and information storage will be explored. Students will gain a broad perspective on nanomaterials research and will receive useful training in proposal preparation to attract resources supporting their research."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Senior undergraduate or graduate students in materials science, engineering, chemistry, physics, or biology."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Two classes per week with lectures, group assignments, and student presentations."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Course grades will be determined from group assignments (40%), the final project (40%), and class participation (20%). There will be two group assignments during the course of the quarter: each group will be presenting for one assignment and providing peer assessment for the other. The second group project will involve a user proposal for submission to the Center for Nanoscale Materials at ANL. The final project topic is open for student groups to choose. For the final project, each group will both present and provide peer assessment. Both the presentation and peer assessment will be evaluated as part of the final grade."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:36 PM (CT)", "subject": "MAT_SCI"}]
