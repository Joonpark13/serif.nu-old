In this class, the topics are both personal and national. Is our food properly prepared, should society have more weapons or fewer, are safety measures in cars worth the cost, how dangerous is illegal immigration, and are the billions of dollars spent on airline screening thwarting potential terrorists or it is just security theater to make us feel safer?<br/> <br/>In reporting on social change, on government regulations and laws and on the political culture of fear and anxiety, it's important for journalists to understand real risks and the price we pay whether in money, convenience, privacy or civil rights.<br/> <br/>We will look at common assumptions, myths and justifications and report on the reality underneath. After analyzing data, hearing from experts and questioning what are the multitude of risks a large society faces, you will look at the precautions we take and decide through your own reporting what's really important."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:37 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
