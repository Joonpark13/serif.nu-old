Through lectures, in-class exercises and real-world assignments, students will begin to develop the editing abilities, editorial judgment, and interactive skill set necessary to tell stories across various platforms, from print and tablet magazines to websites and mobile applications. Students will gain insight into the magazine/interactive publishing industry and understand the relationships these publications foster with their audience. Magazine editing and writing concepts will be discussed and practiced alongside open-web technologies to help students build the knowledge base necessary to be a 21st century magazine/interactive editor and producer. Finally, students will begin to report and edit curated content (both news and features), and use those stories to build narrative packages for both print and interactive platforms."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:37 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
