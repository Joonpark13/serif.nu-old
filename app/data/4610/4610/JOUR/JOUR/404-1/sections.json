Deadline journalism (game stories), features, profiles, investigative, historical and first person pieces are all fair game on the sports page, with venerable traditions.?  <br/> <br/>Students in this course will explore all of these genres - through reading, lecture and discussion - and practice in each, as well, through a workshop format with their peers. <br/>???  <br/>You do not need to be interested in sports writing or even sports to succeed in this course - only good journalism and good story telling.? You will also be held to a very high level of professional conduct.?", "name": "Sports Reporting", "section": "20", "location": "Fisk Hall 307", "topic": "", "course": "404-1", "meeting_time": ["Mo 9:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/JOUR/JOUR/404-1/27029", "instructor": ["Michael Alan Bass"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27029", "subject": "JOUR"}]
