[{"school": "SESP", "overview_of_class": "In this class, we will learn the history, definition, and evolution of the construct of developmental psychopathology (DP). We will consider how DP differs from classical child psychopathology and the implications for research, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of children and adults. We will study models of risk and resilience, developmental pathways, and the transactional model of development.
