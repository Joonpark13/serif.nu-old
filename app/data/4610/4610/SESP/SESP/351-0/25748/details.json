We will consider how digital platforms shape the creation and presentation of content, along with the information sharing practices that develop across different online environments. We will also consider what it means to &quot;learn&quot; through social media, and the ways we decide what information to trust when we are exposed to a variety of digital sources in our everyday lives. The use of multimedia tools and remix culture in particular will be addressed, and how old and new media forms are being fused together to share knowledge in innovative ways."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:40 PM (CT)", "subject": "SESP"}]
