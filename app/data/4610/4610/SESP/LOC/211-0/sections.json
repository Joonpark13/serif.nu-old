[{"school": "SESP", "overview_of_class": "Introduction to Organization Theory and Practice is an introductory course taught within the context of the School of Education and Social Policy as part of its Learning and Organizational Change (LOC) concentration. A basic premise of the course is that a fundamental process for improving people's lives and the institutions in which they live and work is the creation and sharing of knowledge.  Learning is mediated by the context in which it occurs.  This course pays special attention to organizations as a context and analyzes this context through different lenses of organizational theory.  Throughout the course students will learn multiple frameworks for observing and analyzing organizations.  Using these frameworks, the course will provide students with social science tools needed to analyze organizational problems and influence the actions of individuals, groups and organizations.  Students will begin to understand how to best organize and motivate the human capital of the firm, manage social networks and alliances, and execute strategic change.  This will be accomplished through knowledge of competitive decision-making, reward system design, team building, strategic negotiation, political dynamics and corporate culture.", "name": "Intro to Organization Theory & Practice", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall 345", "topic": "", "course": "211-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 1:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SESP/LOC/211-0/26683", "instructor": ["Gail Ann Berger"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "26683", "subject": "LOC"}]
