[{"school": "SESP", "overview_of_class": "This course will introduce students to social policy through a broad overview of some of the major social welfare programs in the U.S. and an assessment of the underlying values that contribute to their evolution.  In addition, we will examine the processes by which social policies are developed and refined. A substantial portion of the course will be devoted to social welfare policies designed to realize our national aspiration to secure equal opportunity for all Americans as well as to moderate what may be deemed unacceptable inequalities of wealth. Students will explore the interaction of various policies and programs including Social Security, welfare reform, taxation, child care subsidies, early childhood education, public education, as well as Medicare, Medicaid and the Obama Administration's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Each student will be given the opportunity to delve more deeply into the complexities of a specific policy of his/her choice, and will in the process develop skills to analyze and offer recommendations for policy improvement.", "name": "Introduction to Social Policy", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall 345", "topic": "", "course": "201-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 4:00PM - 5:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SESP/SOC_POL/201-0/26947", "instructor": ["Marvin R Cohen"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "26947", "subject": "SOC_POL"}]
