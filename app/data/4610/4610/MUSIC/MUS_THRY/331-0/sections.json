[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "This class explores the unaccompanied solo string works of JS Bach;  the emphasis is on works for violin and cello, although some lute compositions may be studied also.  Primary topics include musical structure-especially rhythm (grouping, metric, and surface) and implied counterpoint-and musical expression and interpretation. <br/><br/>Each class meeting will involve analysis  and discussion of individual pieces, mostly led by student presenters.    At-home analysis of the pieces chosen for class discussion will be the primary daily workload.  In addition, each student will write a final project (7-10pp) on two movements.  <br/><br/>Grades will be calculated on homework (60%), final project (30%), and class participation (10%).", "name": "Analytical Studies", "section": "20", "location": "RCMA 1-180", "topic": "Unaccompanied String Music of JS Bach", "course": "331-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/MUSIC/MUS_THRY/331-0/21490", "instructor": ["Richard D Ashley"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "21490", "subject": "MUS_THRY"}]
