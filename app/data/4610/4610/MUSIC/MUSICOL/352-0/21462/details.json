We will navigate Venice's unique topography to interrogate why modern genres such as monody, polychoral church music, and commercial opera began to flourish there in the early 1600s; how printing and commerce drove musical style and practices; intersections between popular and elite musics; and Venetian music works together with literature as rhetorical art forms. Much of the course will focus on music by Giovanni Gabrieli, Claudio Monteverdi, Barbara Strozzi, and Francesco Cavalli, but will also include Venetian styles in diaspora in the works of Heinrich Sch\u00fctz, Marcin Mielczewski, Juan Guti\u00e9rrez de Padilla, and others. Students will tackle articles from scholarly journals, primary sources, the concept of &quot;baroque&quot; within the frame of cultural studies, and they will engage the social functions of vocal music. Among the course requirements are short weekly assignments, an essay on the topic of performance practice, and a final project on the dissemination of musical style. This course is aimed at musicology students and music performance students with some background in baroque music."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:31 PM (CT)", "subject": "MUSICOL"}]
