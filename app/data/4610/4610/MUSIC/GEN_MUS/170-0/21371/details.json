Making use of live and recorded performances, we will examine musical styles that have endured into the twenty-first century, traveling out of the concert hall and conservatory into the larger world via movies, television, and the Internet. In this course you will learn how to make connections between distinctive musical styles and the cultural, historical, and social factors that influenced them, while also developing tools and a vocabulary with which to explore the history, aesthetics, techniques, forms, and genres of Western classical music and beyond. Assignments will include readings, quizzes, listening, written work, and concert attendance."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Course textbook: Robin Wallace, Take Note: An Introduction to Music through Active Listening (Oxford University Press).
