[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "History of rock music and cultures.  This course will introduce students to a framework for critical engagement with the cultural practices of rock, primarily focusing on the 1950's to the present. A broad chronological survey of musical and historical developments will undergird an ongoing discussion of interrelated economic, social, and political issues. What is rock, and how do people participate in it? What are its musical and lyrical elements, and what relation do they have to its visual components? What are the usual historical narratives about rock, and what myths do they perpetuate?  What are rock's modes of production and consumption, of marketing, management, and labor?  How is it connected to cultural identities along lines of race, gender, class, and sexuality? We will trace attempted answers to these questions as they change according to historical moment and location. With an emphasis on close listening to a variety of musical examples, students will be required to write listening and reading journals, compose an analytical essay, and take midterm and final exams based on listening and key concepts.", "name": "History of Rock", "section": "1", "location": "RCMA 1-176", "topic": "", "course": "250-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/MUSIC/GEN_MUS/250-0/27452", "instructor": ["Craig   Davis Pinson"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "27452", "subject": "GEN_MUS"}]
