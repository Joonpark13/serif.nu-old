Conversation, listening comprehension, character practicing, grammar, communicative exercises and essay writing are included throughout the course. The content and activities in this course build upon what has been studied in the introductory level curriculum, gradually adding more sophisticated vocabulary and grammatical structures. Students learn to build from words and phrases, to sentences and cohesive passages, and then to application in communicative tasks.", "name": "Chinese II", "section": "62", "location": "McMillen Crowe Hall 3-130", "topic": "", "course": "121-B", "meeting_time": ["Fr 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/CHINESE/121-B/27765", "instructor": ["Chyi   Chung"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27765", "subject": "CHINESE"}]
