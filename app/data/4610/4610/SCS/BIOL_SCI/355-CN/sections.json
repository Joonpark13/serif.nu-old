[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Immunobiology is the study of the response of higher organisms to foreign substances and pathogenic organisms. We will examine the role of the immune system in both health and disease. The field of immunobiology integrates recent developments and techniques in molecular biology, cell biology, and physiology. The emphasis of this course will be on the human immune system and how its successes, failures and compromises affect our lives. Students will understand how disorders such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, and autoimmune diseases develop in the context of a failed or over-active immune system.", "name": "Immunobiology", "section": "16", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 417", "topic": "", "course": "355-CN", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/BIOL_SCI/355-CN/27761", "instructor": ["Christine Amanda McCary"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27761", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
