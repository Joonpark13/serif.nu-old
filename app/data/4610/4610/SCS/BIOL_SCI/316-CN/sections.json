[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "The primary focus of this course is on the structural, functional and clinical anatomy of the postcranial musculoskeletal system.  The regional anatomy of the muscles, bones, and joints in the human body serves as a basis for presentation of more general functional and biomechanical principles of movement. Related discussions include the clinical significance, and growth and development, of these anatomical regions.  Lecture presentations are supplemented by online video anatomy dissections, in-class small group special exercises, and informal lab sessions covering  surface anatomy and movement exercises, imaging modules, clinical case studies and examination of bones and models.", "name": "Human Structure and Function", "section": "14", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 417", "topic": "", "course": "316-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/BIOL_SCI/316-CN/27759", "instructor": ["Brian T Shea"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27759", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
