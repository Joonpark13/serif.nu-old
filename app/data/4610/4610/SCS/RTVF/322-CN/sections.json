[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an introduction to the American melodrama on television. We will read theoretical texts about the melodrama as a narrative mode that negotiates cultural tensions, especially surrounding the family, gender, and sexuality. We will also explore melodrama historically, as a persistent but malleable form that adapts to changes in the television industry and in American culture at large, focusing in particular on its prominence in times of historical crisis (Vietnam, the AIDS epidemic, the war on drugs). The course will consider melodrama as it appears in anthology dramas/TV movies, procedurals, the miniseries, serial dramas, reality shows, and even sitcoms. Screenings may include soap operas, Roots, Route 66, M*A*S*H, Friday Night Lights, Battlestar Galactica, Starsky and Hutch, thirtysomething, Brian's Song, Requiem for a Heavyweight, Wild Palms, The Wire, and others. Readings will include essays by Lynne Joyrich, Jane Feuer, Thomas Elsaesser, Tania Modleski, and others.
