[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "When we sit down to watch a movie, we take in communication and behaviors that both reflect and shape our real-world communication and behaviors. But in the end, is what we see on the screen real or not? Are we seeing true cultural and social evidence, or are we seeing a stylized representation of reality? This course examines theories and concepts in communication studies in the domain of the popular medium of film. As film is its own form of communication, the course explores how it influences our everyday communication in a variety of contexts, while analyzing different aspects of communication studies, which may include intrapersonal communication, relational communication, group communication and organizational communication, intercultural communication, as well as public address. Presented in a five-week format, this course meets for five Saturdays from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm: 1/9, 1/16, 1/23, 1/30 and 2/6. First class attendance is mandatory.", "name": "Special Topics", "section": "67", "location": "University Hall 101", "topic": "Communication Studies in Film", "course": "395-CN", "meeting_time": ["Sa 9:00AM - 4:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/COMM_ST/395-CN/27770", "instructor": ["Jennifer Lindsy Baker"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27770", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
