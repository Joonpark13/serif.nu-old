[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Advertising legend Jerry Della Famina once said, \"Advertising is the most fun you can have with your clothes on.\" But, before you can get into advertising and have fun, you need to learn how to do it well, and this is the place to do it. In the ADVT 311, 312, 313 sequence, students interested in pursuing a career in creative advertising, and being one of the people who come up with and create actual ads, learn the skills needed to obtain positions as Copywriters or Art Directors in this highly competitive field. Students work with partners under the guidance of a team of creative advertising professionals. At the end of the sequence, students should have an interview-ready portfolio. Periodically, advertising professionals lecture on other areas of the industry, including strategic planning, account management and commercial production. However, this sequence is more workshop than lecture. It's less \"how to\" and more \"trial and error and trial again. And again. And again.\" You get out of it what you put in.", "name": "Advertising: Intermediate Creative", "section": "14", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "312-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/SCS/ADVT/312-CN/27753", "instructor": ["Christopher Michael Bruney"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27753", "subject": "ADVT"}]
