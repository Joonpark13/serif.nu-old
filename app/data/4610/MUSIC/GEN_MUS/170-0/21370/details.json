Who gets to speak about music? Taking these two questions as starting points, this class will help students develop critical listening practices and a vocabulary for talking about music in a clear and detailed way. Additionally, we will consider how gender, race, and other factors affect people's access to musical culture and their participation in musical creation and discourse. Students will be expected to prepare readings and listening assignments for each class meeting and to discuss them using the vocabulary acquired throughout the course. Students should also plan to attend and write about three concerts, and to prepare for comprehensive midterm and final exams."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Course textbook: Julie C.
