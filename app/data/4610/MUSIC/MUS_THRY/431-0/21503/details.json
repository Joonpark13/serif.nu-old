Primary topics include musical structure-especially rhythm (grouping, metric, and surface) and implied counterpoint-and musical expression and interpretation. <br/><br/>Each class meeting will involve analysis and discussion of individual pieces, mostly led by student presenters. At-home analysis of the pieces chosen for class discussion will be the primary daily workload. In addition, each student will write a final project (7-10pp) on two movements. <br/><br/>Grades will be calculated on homework (60%), final project (30%), and class participation (10%)."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:32 PM (CT)", "subject": "MUS_THRY"}]
