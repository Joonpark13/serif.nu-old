By demystifying the criminal underworld, this seminar introduces students to the complex social phenomena underlying the rise of criminal organizations.  Students will learn to use a case study approach to compare and contrast different international cases of gangs and organized crime.  We will specifically focus on the social processes, which explain the development of criminal organizations by:  (1) tracing the importance of social networks, (2) situating their practices within existing cultural structures, (3) examining their participation in legal and illegal markets, and (4) interrogating their relationship to politics and other social institutions. <br/><br/>Enrollment is open to all students regardless of major.
