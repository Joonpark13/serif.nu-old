While observers suggest that religious minorities are at greater risk of persecution due to the global rise of Islamist political movements, there is little discussion of the historical conditions that constituted minority status long before such movements became a phenomenon. Students will use readings from political science, history, legal studies, anthropology, and popular culture to think critically about the nation-state and the concept of &quot;minority,&quot; a term which emerged historically only after World War I. This seminar will focus on the colonial and contemporary histories of religious rights, citizenship, nationalism, and sectarianism in Egypt, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq, and will draw on comparative cases beyond the region."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Mann, Thomas. 2015.
