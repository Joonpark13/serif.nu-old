To connect theory to practice, this course will bring in development practitioners as guest speakers who will share their perspectives and lessons from their experiences.<br/><br/>A central component of the class will be frequent guest lectures by prominent development experts who will bring insights and lessons from their own experiences. Students will gain an appreciation for complexity and difficulty of development, and a broad range of approaches for addressing these challenges.
