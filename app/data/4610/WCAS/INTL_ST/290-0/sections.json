Apply theoretical and conceptual tools to critically assess and explain the history of international development approaches over the last 65 years.<br/><br/>4. Characterize and evaluate the central choices of strategies and approaches for addressing each of the development issues explored in the class, and compare across issues to identify central assumptions and choices in international development.<br/><br/>5. Evaluate development projects and experiences presented by guest practitioners and experts using the concepts and theories from the course, and critique the theories and concepts based on the evidence presented in these case studies. <br/><br/>6. Describe a wide range of actors engaged in international development work, the diversity of skills and professional backgrounds of development practitioners, and reflect on possible ways to become involved in development work and careers. <br/><br/>7.
