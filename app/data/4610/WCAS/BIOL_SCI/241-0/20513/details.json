Lectures are accompanied by a discussion section that will be taught by the course instructor. Although registration for the discussion section is required, participation is voluntary. From the second week onwards, discussions will serve (1) to introduce studying techniques that facilitate conceptual understanding and how to connect seemingly unrelated topics, (2) to practice critical thinking skills, and (3) to develop strategies how to exploit organic chemistry knowledge to understand metabolic processes. Complementing class and discussion groups, office hours will be held twice a week, and additional 1:1 meetings can be arranged with the instructor as needed. Students should expect this class to be immersive and highly interactive at times. Active participation is strongly encouraged."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "One group assignment, 3 quizzes (in class), 1 midterm (in class) and 1 final exam. Students should not expect to see multiple choice type questions. Content of quizzes/exams will be cumulative throughout, testing proficiency through a combination of open questions in three categories: common knowledge base, conceptual understanding, and complex problem solving skills. To do well on these tests, it is essential that students are able to make connections between disparate pieces knowledge/class content, and to apply knowledge to unfamiliar new contexts.<br/>Grading is on an absolute scale that evaluates proficiency, not class rank.
