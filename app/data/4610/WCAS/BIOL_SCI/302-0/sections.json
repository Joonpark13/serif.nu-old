[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Fundamentals of Neurobiology will explore the structure and function of the central nervous system, from the molecular to the systems/behavioral level.  This course will provide an introduction to a number of concepts in cellular and systems neurobiology, including (but not limited to):  ion channel structure and function; the structure and function of neurons and glia; the ionic basis of the membrane potential, graded potential and action potential; synaptic physiology; neuromodulation; neuronal networks; brain regions and pathways; sensory systems and multisensory integration; neural plasticity, including learning and memory; the molecular and cellular correlates of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.", "name": "Fundamentals of Neurobiology", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "302-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 2:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/302-0/20515", "instructor": ["Tracy M Hodgson"], "id": "20515", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
