In addition, you will learn instrumental analysis techniques relevant to analysis of samples in materials chemistry. These techniques will include X-ray crystallography, solid state NMR spectroscopy, electrochemistry, atomic spectroscopy, and a variety of polymer characterization techniques (MALDI-TOF MS, NMR spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, DSC). Some of these analytical techniques may be used to analyze the inorganic samples you prepare in the course.", "qtr": "Winter 2016", "name": "Advanced Laboratory 2", "title": "WCAS CHEM 350-2-20 Advanced Laboratory 2", "lmod": "1/9/16 6:45 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Frederick J Northrup", "instructor_addr": ""}, {"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Shelby   Hatch", "instructor_addr": ""}], "associated_classes": [{"component": "LAB", "room": "Technological Institute B160", "meeting_time": "MoWe 1:00PM - 5:50PM"}, {"component": "LAB", "room": "Technological Institute B160", "meeting_time": "TuTh 1:00PM - 5:50PM"}], "topic": "", "course": "350-2", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "In this course you will study advanced techniques of synthetic inorganic chemistry including synthesis of zeolites, MOFs, and bioinorganic compounds and use of a Schlenk line.
