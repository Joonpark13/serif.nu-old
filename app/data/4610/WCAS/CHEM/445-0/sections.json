Emphasis will be placed on promising emerging science and technology, including that associated with organic photovoltaics, solid-state dye cells, and photo-catalytic and electro-catalytic materials for water splitting. Depending on interest, other topics such as thermoelectrics, thermal-solar water splitting, biofuels, or redox flow batteries and other electrical energy storage technologies may be discussed. The course will be taught at the beginning-graduate-student/upper-level-undergraduate-student level.", "name": "Advanced Physical &amp; Analytical Chemistry", "section": "30", "topic": "Chemistry of Alternate Energy", "course": "445-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/CHEM/445-0/24266", "instructor": ["Joseph T Hupp"], "id": "24266", "subject": "CHEM"}]
