Of particular focus are topics not commonly covered in upper-division undergraduate inorganic courses, especially those relevant to areas of active chemical research. Much of the content and examples will be taken directly from the primary chemistry literature. The first approximately 60% of the course will be comprised of lectures, with the remainder involving short critical literature review student presentations."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Materials will be provided by the instructor."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:45 PM (CT)", "subject": "CHEM"}]
