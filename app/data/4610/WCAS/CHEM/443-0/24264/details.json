It begins with basic rate laws and moves to rate laws for complex reactions, temperature dependence of reaction rates, a discussion of potential energy surfaces for reaction, models for reactions in the gas phase and solution and a development of the theory of unimolecular reactions, and finally partition functions and transition state theory. If time allows we will also cover catalytic reactions."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "TBA"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:45 PM (CT)", "subject": "CHEM"}]
