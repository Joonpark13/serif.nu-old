Science, scientia, was the word for knowledge in the broadest sense?all subjects of inquiry. Poets wrote scientific treatises?Chaucer was known as a master of alchemy as well as the &quot;fadir of Englyshe poesie&quot; and figures we think of today as hard-core scientists, like Johannes Kepler, were practitioners of the creative arts, writing science fiction as well as scientific treatises.<br/><br/>What would it be like to revive this older paradigm, to reintegrate these supposedly disparate ways of thinking about thinking into a single classroom? Can the varied intellectual explorations of Thought from neuroscientific, literary, and artistic perspectives be harnessed and collectively brought to bear on the core issues that interest those seeking scholarly understanding of the human experience??namely, perception, memory, emotions, ethics, knowledge and madness? As we raise these core questions, we will explore readings that present different perspectives on what constitutes thought, what free will is and isn't, and what tools we have for making sense of feelings, logic, perception, and memory."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class attendance and participation required; several short papers; and an in-class presentation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Shakespeare's Hamlet;<br/>David Linden's The Accidental Mind;<br/>Austen's Sense and Sensibility, Descartes' Method;<br/>Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury;<br/>Oliver Sachs' The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat;<br/> and a selection of articles on animal behavior from The American Scientist."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "NOTE: ENG 385/HUM 370-5/NEUROSCI 385 can count as either an Area V (Ethics &amp; Values) or Area VI (Lit &amp; Fine Arts) distribution requirement.
