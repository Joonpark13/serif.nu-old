Thus key terms such as the hemisphere, the planet, the oceanic, the transnational, the global, are investigated both for the debate within the field and, more importantly, how it might orient students' own critical projects in US and transnational literary studies. Subtopics include reading in the digital age and the impact of new methods of digitally driven research paradigms, distant reading, etc. Selected 20th/21st century literary texts will be incorporated and read through competing paradigms."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Permission of department required"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Primary texts may include works by Henry James, Joseph Conrad, Claude McKay, William Faulkner, Jane Bowles, Thomas Pynchon, Leslie Marmon Silko, Amitav Ghosh, Abdellah Ta\u00efa.
