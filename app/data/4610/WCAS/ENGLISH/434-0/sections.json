We will read the three early, distinct printed versions of the play (1603-1623), and we will read intensively in the editorial and critical approaches that have sought to address what is/what has become the mystery of the play, its text(s), its central character(s?), and its function(s) in criticism, the canon, and culture more generally: psychoanalytic Hamlet, post-structuralist Hamlet, Marxist Hamlet, new historicist Hamlet, feminist and queer Hamlets, New Bibliographical and new textualist Hamlets, alongside the critical perspectives of some film versions and Stoppard's revision.  &quot;To be or not to be,&quot; as we will see, is not the only question.", "name": "Studies in Shakespeare", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "434-0", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ENGLISH/434-0/25598", "instructor": ["Jeffrey A Masten"], "id": "25598", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
