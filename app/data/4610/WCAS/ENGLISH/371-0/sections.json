[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will involve the close reading of Faulkner's  four  great tragic novels of race and identity The Sound and The Fury (1929), As I Lay Dying (1930), Light In August (1932),  and  Absalom, Absalom! (1936). Until very recently, these works have been considered central to the canon of modernist fiction and read as meditations on the tortured consciousness of the artist (TSATF, AILD, A,A! ) or the dilemma of the outsider adrift in an alienating world (LIA).  Saturating Faulkner's novels are images of the anguished history of race relations in the American South from the 19th century to the Great Migration and Great Depression.  Yet the tragic legacy of slavery, Faulkner's abiding subject, has been understood by critics as a figure for more abstract and universal moral predicaments.  Our investigation seeks to localize Faulkner's representation of history, particularly his vision of slavery and the effects of the color line as a specifically American crisis, embodied in the remarkable chorus of narrative voices and visions that constitute his fictive world.", "name": "American Novel", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 301", "topic": "Faulkner, Race & Politics", "course": "371-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ENGLISH/371-0/25464", "instructor": ["Julia Ann   Stern"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "25464", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
