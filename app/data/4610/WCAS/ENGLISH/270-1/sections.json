[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is part one of a two-quarter survey of American Literature 1630-1900; in this quarter we will explore the history of American literature from its beginnings in the Puritan migration to the &quot;new world&quot; (1630) through the crisis over slavery in the mid-1850s.  Lectures will emphasize issues of American identity as it is developed in narrative, poetic, fictional, and autobiographical form. The notion of an American literary canon will be at the foreground of our conversations; lectures will discuss the history of canon formation and transformation in light of contemporary scholarship on the significance of race, gender, and class relations in early and 19th-century American culture. Questions of voice, community, representation, and dissent will be our focus as we examine the ways in which early Americans ask: who shall speak, and for whom?", "name": "American Literary Traditions", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "270-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:00PM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ENGLISH/270-1/25444", "instructor": ["Julia Ann   Stern", "Jay A Grossman"], "id": "25444", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
