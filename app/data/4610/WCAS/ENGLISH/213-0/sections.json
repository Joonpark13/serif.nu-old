[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course we will read four of the greatest and most beloved novels in the English language:  Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre, Charles Dickens's Great Expectations and Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway.  These novels offer some of our culture's deepest and most memorable accounts of the trials of maturation, and of the profound role played by language and imagination in the process. Here are four timeless stories of individuals struggling to find their place in a changing and complex world, caught up in the fierce oppositions between tradition and progress, self and society, manners and feeling, idealism and ambition.  We will consider the nature of these struggles and we will explore the indispensable resources that novels provide for understanding and representing them.", "name": "Introduction to Fiction", "section": "01", "location": "Fisk Hall 217", "topic": "", "course": "213-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ENGLISH/213-0/25431", "instructor": ["Jules D Law"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "25431", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
