[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course harbors two primary objectives: 1) to acquaint students with vocabularies and frameworks of argument that are required to analyze a film sequence in terms specific to that medium; and 2) to expose students to a broad range of written texts crucial to the study of cinema, including those written by historians, theorists, artists, popular reviewers, industry professionals, censorship boards, fiction writers, poets, dramatists, and public intellectuals. By absorbing techniques of film analysis, students will learn to craft essay-length interpretations of major cinematic texts. Moreover, they will gain a valuable fluency in how to watch, dissect, and debate films at a time when they retain enormous cultural sway, both as entertainment vehicles and as venues for sustaining or contesting cultural narratives. Meanwhile, through a series of critical and creative writing exercises, participants in this course will learn not just to interpret but to simulate and expand upon an eclectic array of literary and scholarly texts that have inspired or been inspired by the movies. As readers and as writers, then, students will come to appreciate key distinctions but also important overlaps among film history, film theory, film reviewing, and film analysis, tracing how each practice has changed over time and from varying social perspectives.  This course presumes no prior coursework in film studies.", "name": "Introduction to Film and Its Literatures", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "214-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ENGLISH/214-0/27393", "instructor": ["Nicholas K Davis"], "id": "27393", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
