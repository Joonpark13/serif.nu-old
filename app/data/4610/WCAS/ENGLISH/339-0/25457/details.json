This strange beast can be taken as a symbol of tragicomedy itself: many of Shakespeare's contemporaries preferred the classical division of drama into comedy, tragedy, and history, and repeatedly characterized tragicomedy as a &quot;mongrel&quot; devaluation of these categories. Shakespearean tragicomedies defy the formal boundaries and tonal expectations of more settled genres; by reading several of these hybrid plays, we'll form a picture of how dramatic genre shapes plot?and how Shakespeare's tragicomic plots blend genres. We'll also consider how genres and Shakespeare's blending of them influence dramatic representations of gender, social class, and ethnicity; why Renaissance literary theorists disliked tragicomedy, sometimes fiercely; and what the often-spectacular stage effects required by tragicomedy?from statues coming to life to characters' being chased off stage &quot;pursued by a bear&quot;?reveal about Renaissance theatrical practice. By the end of the course, we will have developed an understanding of Renaissance dramatic genre theory and the theatrical practices that challenged that theory, especially Shakespeare's."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Three papers and class participation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "William Shakespeare, The Merchant of Venice, The Winter's Tale, Measure for Measure, All's Well That Ends Well, Troilus and Cressida; Middleton and Rowley, The Changeling; selections from Aristotle, Poetics, Sir Philip Sidney, &quot;Defence of Poesy,&quot; Samuel Johnson, &quot;Preface to Shakespeare&quot;."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
