Proposing that Ulysses has much to teach us about how to read our own everyday worlds, we'll study the book's eighteen episodes alongside sources, annotations, and commentaries. In thinking about all the fictional Dubliners who populate Ulysses, we'll consider Joyce's translation of Homer's Odyssey into a modern epic quest; Ireland's long colonial history and its struggle to throw off British rule; the characters' sometimes conflicting dreams of a sovereign Ireland; the resonances of home, exile, and homecoming; psychoanalytic theory of the unconscious and what Freud called &quot;the psychopathology of everyday life&quot;; scapegoat dynamics in theory and everyday practice; relations among bodies, desire, gender, representational strategies, and social power; performance-studied and unconscious-and theatricality; the pain and mourning of loss; the power of love; the scalpel of wit; the social life?and, often, political bite-of comedy and humor; the socio-economic sex/gender system, including marriage and prostitution, as key to political authority, including Joyce's comment on women's emancipation as &quot;the greatest revolution of our time&quot;; the characters' subjective and intersubjective dynamics; and the power and pleasure of language within the book's play of voices and styles: interior monologue, dialogue, reported speech, omniscient authority, poetry, news, advertising, jokes, parody, obfuscation, song, music, play script, letters, catechism, allusion, citation, non-English words, &amp;c. We'll approach this challenging, maddening, amazing, exhilarating, deeply rewarding book in ways playful and critical, jocoserious and analytic; and we'll seek revelation by engaging it with serious purpose and imaginative freedom."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Attendance and participation, blackboard posts, class presentation, option of two shorter papers or one longer paper or project."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Required: Joyce, Ulysses (Modern Library); Don Gifford with Robert J Seidman, Ulysses Annotated (California); Homer, The Odyssey (Fitzgerald translation); recommended: Joyce, Dubliners; R.
