The reading list is designed as a case history of how a given complex of story materials (centered in this case on a certain image of an idealized heroine) may become conventional over time and also may be dramatically altered when seen through the prisms of different literary types. The list is designed also to test the thesis that reading serious fiction with critical understanding-and with maximum pleasure-involves seeing it as a mode of philosophical argumentation.<br/><br/>Like all First-Year Seminars, this one will concentrate on the writing of argumentative prose of your own. Three short analytical papers will be assigned in the course of the quarter, and several class sessions will be set aside for workshopping specimen papers written by members of the class. In addition, attention will be given to developing effectiveness in oral as well as written communication. To this end, each student will sign up to deliver two short oral presentations on designated topics related to our reading assignments."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Course grades will incorporate all aspects of the course: papers, presentations, and, importantly, class participation.
