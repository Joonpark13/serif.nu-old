[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In many respects, the culture of Renaissance England held startling views on gender, sex, and sexuality. Medical authorities in the period thought that female genitalia was essentially inverted male genitalia, and that it was prone to spontaneous reversals that could make women into men; Renaissance men (all Renaissance men) were thought to be particularly prone to homoerotic desire in their youth; and poetry was seen as both threatening as an incitement to illicit sexual desires and ennobling as a tool with which to transform sexual pleasure into spiritual exaltation. This course will consider Renaissance representations and conceptualizations of sex, gender, and sexuality, primarily in poetry and also in prose, visual art, and theatre. How did physicians, philosophers, and others think about and represent gender and sexuality? How did poets, playwrights, essayists, and visual artists adopt and adapt their culture's views in their artistic practices? What insight into our cultures' views of gender, sex, and sexuality does the culture of Renaissance England provide us?", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "20", "topic": "Sex and the Renaissance", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ENGLISH/101-6/25417", "instructor": ["Christopher Daniel Shirley"], "id": "25417", "subject": "ENGLISH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "People tend to think of fictional narratives as inventions.

We will follow Sir Walter Scott back to the Scotland of the 1745 rebellion, and dwell in his careful evocation of a world that already seemed so distant in his own 1810s. We will silently mouth wooooah in unison to the mind-bending alter-native histories offered by Octavia Butler and Philip K. Dick, who will threaten to unmoor our inmost sense of our place in historical time. And we will reflect on Laurent Binet's postmodern meditations on the com-patibility between narrative and historical truth.

Love her or not, and this seminar also aims to speak to those who do not, you probably agree when she describes her novels as &quot;the little bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush.&quot;  Austen offers a tiny painted cameo as a metaphor for her novels to belittle their topic:  family life, courtship, and marriage.  But Austen's metaphor takes her far outside the home, because a bit of ivory involves global traffic?elephants are not native to England.<br/><br/>This freshman seminar aims to challenge Austen's characterization of her work by pondering how her novels make us think?and what they invite us to think about.  In this class, we'll read four Austen novels, each paired with complementary shorter readings to help illuminate the historical, critical, and global questions they help us ask.  We will read Austen's Pride and Prejudice alongside feminist writing by Austen's shocking contemporary Mary Wollstonecraft to ponder this novel's sexual underbelly:  how does Austen relate economics and female sexuality in the early nineteenth century?  Is marriage?even happy marriage?really all about romance?  Next, we will read Austen's Emma alongside economic history by E. P. Thompson and Karl Marx to think about social status and class antagonism.  How much does social class define who you are, in the nineteenth century and today?  For our third novel, we'll read Austen's Mansfield Park alongside contemporary critical treatments of slavery and abolition.  We will also ponder the question:  how can we say that Mansfield Park is about slavery when its references to this topic are rare?  What critical techniques do we use to argue for the meaning of literary texts?  Finally, we'll read Austen's Northanger Abbey to reflect on the story she tells about popular novels like her own.  Alongside Northanger Abbey, we'll read excerpts from popular Gothic fiction of the time to reflect on Gothic horror and sensation, then and now.<br/><br/>There will be three mandatory film screenings for this class:  Pride and Prejudice, directed by Joe Wright; &quot;Clueless,&quot; directed by Amy Heckerling; and Mansfield Park, directed by Patricia Rozema.

For one thing, both books are long, and part of what we will talk about are the specific pleasures and challenges of reading BIG BOOKS.  How do we gauge, and thereby engage with, narratives of disproportionate scale and encyclopedic ambition? How do we lose, or find, our place in colossal fictional worlds?<br/><br/>But Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin and Melville's Moby-Dick are BIG BOOKS in another way, too.  Each of them has been a hugely influential and profoundly consequential novel.  Indeed, one cannot really understand American literary and cultural history if one is not familiar with these two BIG BOOKS.    Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel was a watershed text for both sides in the Civil War.  Upon meeting Stowe, Abraham Lincoln reportedly said to her, &quot;So you're the little woman who wrote the book that made this great war!&quot;  Stowe's novel sold 300,000 copies in the first year?an unprecedented number?and her story became the basis for countless stage adaptations, spin-offs, parodies, editorials, refutations, and re-writes. (Check out some of them here: <a>http://utc.iath.virginia.edu</a>)  The reputation of Melville's novel took longer to take shape?its early readers enjoyed the material about whaling, but didn't quite know what to make of the story of Ahab's obsession with the White Whale.  But over the course of the twentieth century these views reversed themselves, and Ahab's maniacal quest has come to be widely recognized as one of the masterpieces of world literature.  Our work in Winter 2016 will be, like Ahab, to take on these Leviathans, these BIG BOOKS, better to understand them and the worlds they shaped?including our own.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "23", "topic": "Big Books", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ENGLISH/101-6/25420", "instructor": ["Jay A Grossman"], "id": "25420", "subject": "ENGLISH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this class, we will closely read three classic (and, incidentally, famously appealing) English novels of the nineteenth century, the golden age of popular fiction.

In contradistinction to the earlier (and slightly concurrent) popularity of the more passive female protagonist of Twilight, the image of a strong female lead, shooting arrows, jumping off of trains, and generally kicking ass, has captured the attention of readers, movie-goers, and the mainstream media. This class asks why the strong heroine is popular in this cultural moment both by analyzing the primary texts that feature them and by reading them in conjunction with analysis of the phenomena from the perspective of cultural studies. Representations of these heroines in the media will also be treated as texts for unpacking the significance of the trend.  Does the introduction of these young women in young adult fiction change the way popular culture represents the role of women and girls in society more generally? As a foundation for our investigation, the course will begin by historicizing the notion of what it means to be a &quot;heroine&quot; in the popular imagination and specifically in the narratives offered by literature and film. Traditionally, is the heroine's journey distinct from the hero's? How might the heroine destabilize constructs of gender and sexuality? How does the role of the heroine relate to genre? (Are the genres of fantasy and dystopian fiction, for instance, especially conducive to the emergence of a Katniss-like heroine?) To answer these questions, our readings will engage with gender and feminist theory and masculinity studies. In doing so, we will dissect the traits characterizing recent popular heroines and examine how they might undermine hierarchies and norms of gender and sexuality. At the same time, our inquiry will trouble whether the current era of heroines is actually as subversive as it might seem by investigating what gender roles and stereotypes these characters and their stories might be reinforcing.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "25", "topic": "Action Heroines", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ENGLISH/101-6/25422", "instructor": ["Whitney Blair Taylor"], "id": "25422", "subject": "ENGLISH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Hailed by many as one of the greatest novels every written, George Eliot's Middlemarch is the gripping story of ambition, idealism, love, and scandal in a Victorian provincial town.

We will experience Middlemarch as its first audience did: in serial form, immersing ourselves in its vibrant fictional world over the course of several weeks.
