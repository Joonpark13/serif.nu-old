The etymology of the word itself, fiction, means &quot;made.&quot; But often, fiction writers draw on and transform true stories, settings and people from history in pursuit of their own artistic vision, a practice sometimes called literary historicism.<br/><br/>This first-year seminar is about these encounters between fiction and history. We will follow Sir Walter Scott back to the Scotland of the 1745 rebellion, and dwell in his careful evocation of a world that already seemed so distant in his own 1810s. We will silently mouth wooooah in unison to the mind-bending alter-native histories offered by Octavia Butler and Philip K. Dick, who will threaten to unmoor our inmost sense of our place in historical time. And we will reflect on Laurent Binet's postmodern meditations on the com-patibility between narrative and historical truth. All this, and more: a heart-rending short story set on a cosmological scale; a video game that attempts to recount the entirety of human history; and a Holly-wood blockbuster about time travel or the Oedipus Complex ? or maybe both."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "The first essay will be five pages (1500 words), due in the third week. <br/>The group assignment presentations will take place in the seventh week, with individual reflection papers of two to three pages (6-900 words) due in the eighth week. <br/>The final essay will be eight pages (2400 words), due in the exam period."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Sir Walter Scott, Waverly (1814; novel) <br/>Philip K.
