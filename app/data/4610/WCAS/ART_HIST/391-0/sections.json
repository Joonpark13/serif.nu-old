[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar introduces the students to a range of art-historical approaches and to the writings of key figures in the history of the discipline. We will address two basic but difficult questions: What is art history? And how did it get this way? Through a series of short writing exercises, we will examine ways of thinking and writing concretely and rigorously about works of art in different mediums, and across different cultures.
