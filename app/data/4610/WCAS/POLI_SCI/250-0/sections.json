The first is to introduce students to some of the basic theories of comparative politics. The second is to teach students how to think like political scientists. This means that they will become familiar with the rules of causal inference, the ways that we can prove that one phenomenon causes another. By the end of the course, they will be able to both critically evaluate the causal arguments of others and construct their own causal arguments."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and Discussion Sections"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Midterm and Final, Short Exercises, Discussion"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Course packet<br/>Arend Lijphart, Patterns of Democracy (Yale UP), 978-0300078930"}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/POLI_SCI/250-0/24391", "instructor": ["Andrew L Roberts"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "24391", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
