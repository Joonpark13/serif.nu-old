It is a large lecture course aimed at Freshmen and Sophomores. It satisfies distributional requirements for majors in many Schools, and serves as a &quot;gateway&quot; to further law-related courses in political science. Some of the topics it covers include: what is law, and why people obey it; the relationship between law and social change; crime, the police, and the prison crisis in America; how people get a lawyer and how lawyers make a living; civil justice and the litigation explosion; courts, judges and politics; Supreme Court decision making; and legal strategies for making change."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "The goal of this course is to help you think critically and analytically about legal issues and to understand the relationship between elements of the legal process and the institutional, economic and political forces that surround them."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "lecture and discussion sections"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "There will be two midterms and a final exam. Each exam will focus on the preceding three weeks of lectures, reading, and discussion. The final exam will also touch on important questions that cut across all segments of the course. Sample exams can be found at the course Blackboard web site, along with a statement of exam policies and ways you can upgrade a bad midterm score. You are expected to attend and participate in all of your discussion section meetings.
