[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Scholars and practioners recognize that international law and international legal institutions are increasingly important in international politics. The study of international law is also an intellectual arena for theoretical innovation.  This seminar examines contemporary scholarship regarding international law and international relations.  <br/><br/>The topic of international law is a place to study the interaction of material, power and normative forces, and a place where one can employ all of the newest methods and approaches in political science.  The new international law scholarship is being built in an unusually interdisciplinary fashion. We will be reading work that builds on economic theories, sociological theories, and traditional international relations approaches.   We will also be examining questions of broad interest within political science and sociology- the social construction and influence of norms in international affairs, the importance of murky issues like legitimacy and fairness in shaping public perceptions and actor behavior, and how institutions of international law including international treaties and international courts implicitly and explicitly shape the international political process and state behavior.", "name": "International Law and International Politics", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "443-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 9:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/POLI_SCI/443-0/24564", "instructor": ["Karen   Alter-Hanson"], "id": "24564", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
