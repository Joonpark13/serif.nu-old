Various dimensions of humor such as the absurd, the pathetic, the political, the tragic and the mundane will be explored, as well as instances where attempts at humor fall short, create controversy, offend or fail to translate. Students will experiment with different ways of incorporating humor into making, specifically within the mediums of drawing, writing, collage and print.
