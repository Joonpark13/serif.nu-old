[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, we will explore the major themes of early American history, from the first encounters between native people, Europeans, and Africans to the impassioned battles of the Civil War.  Our goal will be to track the variety of meanings that America had for the people who lived here: men and women, rich and poor, free and slave.  We will examine stories of growth and decay, of war and peace, of conflict and collaboration.  We will also tell a story about how thirteen disparate and unruly British colonies came to form a new kind of nation: a republic, dedicated (as Abraham Lincoln would later recall) to the proposition that all men were created equal.  Topics to be covered include colonial encounters, slavery, religion, social reform movements, sexuality, manifest destiny, the foundations of republican government, and the meanings of capitalism and democracy.", "name": "History of the United States, Precolonial to the Civil War", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "210-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/210-1/24910", "instructor": ["Caitlin Annette Fitz"], "id": "24910", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
