We will travel from country to country studying son in Cuba, samba in Brazil, tango in Argentina, corrido in Mexico, and vallenato in Colombia, among others, in order to comprehend how certain sounds became emblems of modern nations. We will also navigate the circuits in which certain sounds, such as cumbia, salsa, rock, hip hop, and reggaeton crossed geographic boundaries and evolved into transnational genres that express the collective experience of exile and migration of large populations. We address these histories in an interdisciplinary manner, reading history, anthropology, sociology, and ethnomusicology, and analyzing critically song lyrics, music videos, feature films, and documentaries. The goal is to help students understand why popular music has been a vehicle of nation-state formation in the region. By the end of the course, students should be able to explain how popular music in Latin America figures in struggles over hegemony, socio-economic mobility, and urbanization, as a means of protests and revolt, as a field for developing patterns of consumption for emerging national markets, and as symbolic currency in international negotiations involving issues of representation, legitimacy, and self-determination."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendanceClass participationPaper, finalPapersQuizzesAttendance and participation, response papers, quizzes, and a final paper"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Paul Austerlitz, Merengue.
