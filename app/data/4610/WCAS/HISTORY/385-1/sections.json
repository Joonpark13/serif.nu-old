[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will survey some of the major events and personages which shaped South Asian history, culture, and politics in the early modern era. We begin with the integration of India's multiple religious, literary, and visual cultures under the Mughal Empire's tolerant vision of political islam, encapsulated by their ideology of &quot;peace with all&quot; (sulh-i kull).  This policy included the welcoming of European merchants and missionaries who began arriving in the Indian subcontinent ca. 16th century; but as Mughal power waned in the 18th century, it faced challenges not only from former client states and regional kingdoms that sought to fill its shoes, but also from the encounter with Europe, particularly the growing military and economic might of the British. We will follow this trajectory through to the consolidation of the British East India Company's power in Bengal in the late eighteenth century, as the British role in India transitioned from one of mere traders to that of imperial colonists with a determination to enact a so-called &quot;civilizing mission.&quot;", "name": "History of Modern South Asia, 1500-1800", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "385-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/385-1/24958", "instructor": ["Rajeev Kumar Kinra"], "id": "24958", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
