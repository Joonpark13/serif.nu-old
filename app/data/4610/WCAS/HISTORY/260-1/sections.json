[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "A survey of Latin America through images and primary texts, from the era of Spanish exploration and conquest through Independence (roughly 1492 to 1830), that stresses the experiences and sociocultural contributions of Americans, Europeans, and Africans to the region's history. Participants will examine textual sources in translation, as well as music, film, and especially images - maps, artwork, architecture - with the following topics for consideration: Aztec, Maya, Inca, and Iberian civilizations; models of governance in comparative perspective (Spanish, Portuguese, and Amerindian); religion, the Catholic Church, and the Inquisition; the development of industries such as mining and sugar; urban and rural life; and the significance of race, caste, class, gender, and honor. Brazil provides a continuous counterpoint to Mexico and the Andes, while &quot;fringe&quot; areas of empire, such as Cuba, Argentina, and northern Mexico, become central in the final weeks.", "name": "History of Latin America in the Colonial Period 1492-1821", "section": "20", "topic": "Becoming Latin American", "course": "260-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/260-1/25072", "instructor": ["Paul F Ramirez"], "id": "25072", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
