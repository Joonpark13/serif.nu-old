[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Perhaps the ultimate sign of the promises and perils of modernity, drugs (broadly defined to include tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, marijuana, heroin, cocaine, LSD, amphetamines, this list could go on forever) have a complex history that spans far more than even the three centuries covered in this course. We will explore the history of drugs in America from John Rolfe's first attempts to make English tobacco compete with Spanish gold through the paradoxical war on illegal drugs and boom of pharmaceuticals in our current culture. This complex history of substances will be used to highlight general trends in U.S. history and to explore the complex intersections of legality and illegality, medicine, trade, and law. Revealing the importance of changes in economic patterns for the history of the United States and the inextricable relationship between drugs and trade, the course will also explore the general complexities, contingencies, and continuities of history; for example, a panic about university students using amphetamines as a study aid? in 1938.", "name": "Topics In History", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 318", "topic": "Drugs ,Trade In Amer.

We will examine the factors which prompted a broad cast of historical actors to reorganize their social, political, and religious worlds in new and unprecedented ways, including the rise of Bolshevism in Russia, the contentious politics of immigration and racial difference in the United States during the Progressive Era, the horrific ravages of the Great War, and the remapping of the Middle East following the Balfour Declaration, to name but a few examples. We will use a variety of primary and secondary sources, as well as works of literature, art, music, and film, to explore how the 365 days of 1917 irrevocably transformed global conceptions of modernity, altered the processes and ramifications of international conflict and war, and helped to usher in new challenges of a shrinking, increasingly interconnected world. This course proposes that as a result, historical actors in 1917 set the stage for many of the conflicts and debates of our twenty-first century.", "name": "Topics In History", "section": "22", "location": "University Hall 312", "topic": "1917: One Year That Shook the World", "course": "392-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/392-0/24963", "instructor": ["Aram Gregory Sarkisian"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "24963", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course offers students a thematic and methodological approach to Medieval and Early Modern European studies. Students will explore how three academic disciplines - history, economics, and political science - explain one historical phenomenon: the rise and fall of the European city-states. Largely forgotten since the rise of the nation-state, independent cities ruled the middle of Europe from 1100-1600, stretching from the Low Countries in the north, through the German cities and Swiss Confederation, and ending in the Italian city-states. By dividing the course disciplinarily rather than temporally, this course allows students to study in one forum many different methods, theories, and concepts while maintaining a thematic focus.

They inspired playwrights during the heyday of print culture, and filmmakers as recently as Walt Disney's Aladdin. From the historian's perspective, they are a collection of stories compiled during the Middle Ages in such cities as Cairo and Damascus. They reflect traditions that are much older, and draw upon legends widely repeated in such diverse regions as China, India, Iran and Turkey. Analysts of pre-modern societies in the Islamic world now recognize The Arabian Nights as a major literary source that sheds light on many types of colorful people whose antics enlivened the scene in great Islamic cities of pre-modern times, but who remain largely invisible in more formal sources. The Nights also raise issues of cultural practice that contrast with formal strictures imposed by such sacred texts as the Koran itself. The fact that the stories were allegedly told by a woman conniving to stave off vengeance killings by a ruler raises intriguing questions about male-female relations. We will consider these issues in the context of various translations that themselves reveal biases of modern-day writers, who may have reveled in the worlds of counter-culture or pornography.", "name": "Topics In History", "section": "31", "location": "Fisk Hall 114", "topic": "Arabian Nights Counter Culture or Pornography", "course": "392-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/392-0/24968", "instructor": ["Carl Forbes   Petry"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "24968", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The battle between advocates of Darwinian evolution and \"creationists\" has helped define the way we think about the relationship between science, religion, public policy, and the law.
