Students will explore how three academic disciplines - history, economics, and political science - explain one historical phenomenon: the rise and fall of the European city-states. Largely forgotten since the rise of the nation-state, independent cities ruled the middle of Europe from 1100-1600, stretching from the Low Countries in the north, through the German cities and Swiss Confederation, and ending in the Italian city-states. By dividing the course disciplinarily rather than temporally, this course allows students to study in one forum many different methods, theories, and concepts while maintaining a thematic focus. No previous history, economics, or politics experience is required."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendanceClass participationExam, finalPapersGRADES ARE BASED ON FOUR CRITERIA: ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION (10%), TWO SHORT PAPERS OF 3-5 PAGES EACH (30%), A COMMENTARY OF ANOTHER STUDENT'S WORK (20%), AND A FINAL TAKE-HOME EXAM (40%) OF 5-7 PAGES."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Medieval Towns: A Reader: http://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Towns-Readings-Civilizations-Cultures/dp/1442600918 ISBN 978-1442600911<br/><br/><br/>Urban Europe, 1100-1700: http://www.amazon.com/Urban-Europe-1100-1700-David-Nicholas/dp/0333949838 ISBN 978-0333949832<br/><br/><br/>All other readings will be online or a course pack<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "HISTORY AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Europe"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
