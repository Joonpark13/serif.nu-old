[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course focuses on African social history but approaches the topic from a variety of disciplines. Whatever your specialized interests may be, historians of Africa should be familiar with the shifting state of scholarly debate over the core questions that occupy &quot;specialists&quot; in that vast period. Such questions include: the development of political cultures of centralization and heterarchy; urbanization; migration, labor, and food systems; long-distance and trade diasporas; and so forth. They should develop at least a reading fluency in the non-traditional methodological approaches used to explore those questions. Such approaches include: archaeology, historical linguistics, oral traditions, art history, as well as the analysis and interpretation of written documents. In digging into both the topics and methods that constitute Africa's earlier social history, the Seminar will also consider the shifting influence of political and ideological forces shaping scholarly interest in Africa's earlier history.", "name": "General Field Seminar in African History", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "450-1", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/450-1/24978", "instructor": ["David Lee   Schoenbrun"], "id": "24978", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
