The course will take students from French Revolution that started integrating the Jews into the fabric of European society through the establishment of the State of Israel. It will highlight the plurality of models of Jewish integration and acculturation, the formation of new Jewish identities, the split of the traditional community under the impact of Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment), the rise of Liberal and Orthodox trends within Judaism, and the spread of Jewish political movements such as socialism and nationalism. Based on a plethora of English-language documents, the course will introduce students to those problems of interaction between the general society and the Jewish minority that pointed toward the twentieth century transformation of modernity.  In sum, the course will explore the fascinating response of Jews to modernity on political, societal, theological, and cultural levels.", "name": "Jewish History 1789-1948", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "203-3", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/203-3/24988", "instructor": ["Yohanan   Petrovsky-Shtern"], "id": "24988", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
