It is the story of China's turbulent effort to acquire \"wealth and power\" in the modern world. The course will pay equal attention to the Republican (1912-1949) and communist (1949-) eras and will consider the disintegration of the Chinese polity into warlordism, the efforts of the Nationalists to reestablish viable state authority under the Republic, the disastrous eight years of war with Japan (World War II), the civil war, and the triumphs and tribulations of communist rule. Within this chronological framework, the course will explore such topics as nationalism, the changing status of Chinese women, the power of revolutionary charisma, and the place of the Patriotic Democratic Movement of 1989 in China's long tradition of student and labor protest.
