We will survey the political, economic, social, cultural, and intellectual developments that transformed European civilization, and trace the varied ways in which historians have sought to make sense of them. Our focus will primarily be on Western Europe, though we will also explore the extent to which Europeans were fundamentally shaped by their encounters with non-European cultures. Specific topics include the Crusades, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion sectionLectureLecture and discussion sections"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Exam, finalPapersPapers, midterm, final exam"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "TBA"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "HISTORY AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Europe"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
