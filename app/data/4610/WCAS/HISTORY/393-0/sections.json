[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Apparitions, moving crucifixes, miraculous cures - these and other aspects of Catholicism have long posed intellectual and methodological challenges for students of the past. Participants in this course will explore manifestations of Catholicism in Latin America (the former colonies of Spain and Portugal), with special attention to the various texts, objects, and living communities that have assisted scholars in making sense of religious experience. We will consider ways of thinking and writing about religion, stressing recent developments and interdisciplinary exchanges, as well as reasons for doing so. How does an appreciation of human and divine interactions, sacraments, lay associations, and ritual specialists illuminate topics like slavery, gender, migration, labor regimes, colonialism, and nationalism?", "name": "Approaches to History", "section": "40", "topic": "Catholicisms in the Americas", "course": "393-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/393-0/25067", "instructor": ["Paul F Ramirez"], "id": "25067", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar explores the ways in which historians strive to understand the political ideas and practices of Islamic activists since the late 19th century. While the course will allow students to familiarize themselves with various Muslim intellectuals and modern currents of thought (&quot;moderate reform,&quot; Islamism, post-Islamism, Wahhabism and Salafism), our primary goal will be to reflect on how scholars approach the history of mental constructs, how underlying assumptions about modernity, religion in general and Islam in particular shape the narratives that scholars produce, and how these narratives may determine the judgments we make about the &quot;evolution&quot; of Islamic thought and activism (often described in terms of progress and regress).", "name": "Approaches to History", "section": "41", "topic": "Islamic Political Thought", "course": "393-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:00PM - 8:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/393-0/25068", "instructor": ["Henri   Lauziere"], "id": "25068", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In Late Antiquity, Jews and early Christians were accused of murdering and eating young children during their initiation rites. In the Middle Ages, whole Jewish communities were routinely massacred in response to accusations of ritual murder and cannibalism. in the modern period, similar accusations have been leveled, with catastrophic results, throughout Europe, the Middle East, and even the United States. Why did belief in religiously inspired ritualized cannibalism, murder, and torture gain and maintain so much traction over such a wide expanse of time?  How did accusations against Jews relate to similar charges against heretics, witches, satanic cults, and other marginal groups? This course will trace the origins, diffusion, and surprising persistence of the &quot;blood libel,&quot; and will survey historians' attempts to make sense of this phenomenon.  We will analyze a wide array of ancient, medieval, and modern sources (all in English translation), and discuss the continued impact of the blood libel motif on contemporary political and theological discourse.", "name": "Approaches to History", "section": "42", "topic": "The Blood Libel", "course": "393-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/393-0/25069", "instructor": ["David   Shyovitz"], "id": "25069", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will examine the Indiana Jones films from the perspective of three key historical frames of reference. First, the context of European colonial expansion in Asia and Africa during the 19th and early 20th centuries ? a formative stage for the emergence of a modern scholarly idiom about places like Egypt, India, and &quot;The Orient&quot; generally, much of which would have been inherited by an archaeologist (even a fictional one) like Jones. Secondly the 1930s, the timeframe of the films themselves, when British and French colonial power was on the wane, Nazi Germany and the USSR were on the rise, and America was on the cusp of its own emergence as a global &quot;superpower.&quot;  As with the heyday of European colonial expansion in the 19th century, the nexus between geopolitical power and scholarly knowledge loomed large in this latter contest for global supremacy, too, both in real life and in the Jones films. But the films' idealization of Jones and the 1930s actually emerges from a nostalgic, late Cold War vantage point. Thus our third historical frame of reference ? basically, from the 1980s to the present ? will force us to examine the earlier legacies of Western power and knowledge from our own perspective, as they are refracted in the films, and as they have been re-imagined and redeployed in the present-day American political and cultural imagination.", "name": "Approaches to History", "section": "43", "topic": "Indiana Jones in Historical Context: Heroic Schol", "course": "393-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/393-0/25070", "instructor": ["Rajeev Kumar Kinra"], "id": "25070", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
