While the course will allow students to familiarize themselves with various Muslim intellectuals and modern currents of thought (&quot;moderate reform,&quot; Islamism, post-Islamism, Wahhabism and Salafism), our primary goal will be to reflect on how scholars approach the history of mental constructs, how underlying assumptions about modernity, religion in general and Islam in particular shape the narratives that scholars produce, and how these narratives may determine the judgments we make about the &quot;evolution&quot; of Islamic thought and activism (often described in terms of progress and regress)."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationPapersClass participation (25%), short papers (75%)."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Ali Abdel Razek, Islam and the Foundations of Power Edinburgh University Press, ISBN: 978-074-868-9835"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "This class will meet once a week on Wednesday evenings.
