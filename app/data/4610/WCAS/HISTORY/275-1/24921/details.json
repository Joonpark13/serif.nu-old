This means that science takes place in social settings, where it is profoundly affected by the cultural values and group dynamics of the people engaged in making scientific knowledge. This course explores the social spaces of science in early modern Europe during the so-called 'Scientific Revolution.' We will survey the varied and surprising spaces in which scientific knowledge was produced, from princely courts and grand cathedrals to humble artisanal workshops, Europe's overseas colonies, and the very first scientific laboratories. In so doing, we will see how science intersected with religion, politics, empire, the Printing Revolution, the Renaissance, long-distance commercial and intellectual networks, and the origins of capitalism."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion sectionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Participation, Short writing assignments, Final research paper"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Mario Biagiloi, Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism (9780226045603)<br/><br/><br/>Deborah Harkness, The Jewel House: Elizabethan London and the Scientific Revolution (9780300143164)<br/><br/><br/>Historical documents written by and about Galileo, Newton, and others"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "HISTORY AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Europe"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
