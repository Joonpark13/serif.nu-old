[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Science is a human activity, and humans are social animals. This means that science takes place in social settings, where it is profoundly affected by the cultural values and group dynamics of the people engaged in making scientific knowledge. This course explores the social spaces of science in early modern Europe during the so-called 'Scientific Revolution.' We will survey the varied and surprising spaces in which scientific knowledge was produced, from princely courts and grand cathedrals to humble artisanal workshops, Europe's overseas colonies, and the very first scientific laboratories. In so doing, we will see how science intersected with religion, politics, empire, the Printing Revolution, the Renaissance, long-distance commercial and intellectual networks, and the origins of capitalism.", "name": "History of Western Science and Medicine: Origins in Early Mod Europe", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "275-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/275-1/24921", "instructor": ["Lydia   Barnett"], "id": "24921", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
