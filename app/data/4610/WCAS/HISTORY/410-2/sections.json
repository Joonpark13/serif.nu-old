[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is the second part of a three-quarter sequence required of first-year doctoral students in U.S. history, though it is open to students in other departments who wish to gain a deeper knowledge of the nineteenth-century United States. The course will introduce students to scholarship on major issues in the history of the nineteenth-century United States, and to the evolution of scholarly thinking about those issues.  We will sample classic texts and newer works in an effort to reconstruct - and to join - the conversations that historians have had across time.", "name": "General Field Seminar in American History", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L40", "topic": "", "course": "410-2", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/410-2/24977", "instructor": ["Susan   Pearson"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>Graduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "24977", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
