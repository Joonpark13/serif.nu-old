The continent's poverty is usually explained as the absence of modernity; ethnic tensions are assumed to be a continuation of ancient tribalism; famines are said to be similar to those in the Bible. In contrast, this course will focus on the processes of modern history that have shaped the continent, emphasizing those that first emerged during the period of colonial rule (ca. 1890 to ca. 1960). Although we will not minimize the significance of Africa's older historical inheritances, particularly in the realms of religion, family institutions, and political culture, we will see that the presence of such long-standing cultural traditions does not imply the absence of change. On the contrary, one of our central themes will be how traditions have been adapted, transformed, and innovated over the course of the century. Throughout the quarter we will focus on how ordinary men and women struggled to shape their lives. To that end, the imaginative insights provided by African novelists are important complements to the broader historical trends outlined in the lectures and other texts."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "DiscussionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Discussion sectionExam, finalPapersParticipation in weekly discussion sections, three or four short papers on the readings, and a final exam"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Richard Reid, A History of Modern Africa, 1800 to the Present<br/><br/>Frederick Cooper, Africa Since 1940: the Past of the Present<br/><br/>Buchi Emecheta, The Joys of Motherhood<br/><br/>Ousmane Sembene, God's Bits of Wood<br/><br/>Chinua Achebe, A Man of the People"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "HISTORY AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Africa/Middle East"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
