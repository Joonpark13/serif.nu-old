These images (among them images of savage Africa, noble Africa, suffering Africa, and primitive Africa) served Western intellectuals in their discussions of the ideas of &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;civilization.&quot; Although slavery and colonialism no longer exist, these images have continued to be remade, in new variants, by successive generations of novelists, political theorists, journalists, filmmakers, and humanitarians. Our readings will include some of the most influential texts in the formation of popular Western images of Africa, with a particular focus on 20th century examples."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationPaper, finalPapersReadings(a) Active, informed participation in seminar discussions, which will be evaluated in terms of engagement with the required readings; (b) two or three short papers during the quarter, at about five pages each; (c) a final paper at about ten pages long.
