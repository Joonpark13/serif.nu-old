[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The thesis of this seminar is that contemporary Western understandings of Africa have been shaped not simply by ignorance, but by specific images that were first constructed during the period of the West's most intense interaction with the continent, starting in the era of the Atlantic slave trade and culminating in colonial conquest and rule in the late-19th through mid-20th centuries.  These images (among them images of savage Africa, noble Africa, suffering Africa, and primitive Africa) served Western intellectuals in their discussions of the ideas of &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;civilization.&quot;  Although slavery and colonialism no longer exist, these images have continued to be remade, in new variants, by successive generations of novelists, political theorists, journalists, filmmakers, and humanitarians.  Our readings will include some of the most influential texts in the formation of popular Western images of Africa, with a particular focus on 20th century examples.", "name": "First-Year Seminar-Non-Western History", "section": "21", "topic": "Africa in the Western Literary Imagination", "course": "103-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 4:00PM - 5:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/103-6/24899", "instructor": ["Jonathon P Glassman"], "id": "24899", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
