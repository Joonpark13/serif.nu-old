This course will focus on contemporary socio-political developments in Latin America in long-term historical context, and the different methodological approaches to researching and writing the history of the present. As freshman seminar, the class will be run as an open workshop that is writing- and discussion-oriented, and aimed to help first-year students to improve their analytical and critical abilities. Students work together through the specific challenges they encounter, and share the research and writing process as well as their final products with the class. Initially, we focus on the practical side of the \"historian's craft,\" and consider the sources, methods, and problems of research for Latin American and Caribbean history. Then we move into individual cases in order to consider how change and crisis in the late-twentieth and early twenty-first centuries is connected to earlier conjunctures. We examine current developments in the Andes (with particular attention to Bolivia, and Venezuela), the Caribbean (particularly Cuba), and Central America (specifically Mexico). The goal is to comprehend four major historical problems: the popular democratic mobilizations of impoverished working people, the election and trajectories of Left and center-Left governments, the expansive wave of terror of the illegal drug business, and U.S. foreign policy in the hemisphere.
