[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In an age in which religion has become the idiom of insurgency for contesting power from the centers of the world, the secular mix of participatory and representative democracy currently sweeping Latin America warrants closer study, both for what it can teach us about the region and the future of democracy itself. This course will focus on contemporary socio-political developments in Latin America in long-term historical context, and the different methodological approaches to researching and writing the history of the present. As freshman seminar, the class will be run as an open workshop that is writing- and discussion-oriented, and aimed to help first-year students to improve their analytical and critical abilities. Students work together through the specific challenges they encounter, and share the research and writing process as well as their final products with the class. Initially, we focus on the practical side of the &quot;historian's craft,&quot; and consider the sources, methods, and problems of research for Latin American and Caribbean history. Then we move into individual cases in order to consider how change and crisis in the late-twentieth and early twenty-first centuries is connected to earlier conjunctures. We examine current developments in the Andes (with particular attention to Bolivia, and Venezuela), the Caribbean (particularly Cuba), and Central America (specifically Mexico). The goal is to comprehend four major historical problems: the popular democratic mobilizations of impoverished working people, the election and trajectories of Left and center-Left governments, the expansive wave of terror of the illegal drug business, and U.S. foreign policy in the hemisphere. Finally, we explore the inextricably bound history of the Americas in order to understand one of the most politically charged issues of our present: Latin American immigration to the U.S.", "name": "First-Year Seminar-American History", "section": "20", "topic": "Contemporary Latin America in Historical Perspecti", "course": "102-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/102-6/24896", "instructor": ["Lina M Britto"], "id": "24896", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Abraham Lincoln is remembered as one of the greatest heroes of American history.  But what do we really know about Lincoln, and how do we know it?  In this course we will explore Lincoln's life and writings, and we will also look at how people have understood and remembered Lincoln over the last 150 years.  We will focus on Lincoln's biography, his stance on slavery and emancipation, and his understanding of presidential power in wartime.  We will also ask what we can learn about the United States from representations of Lincoln in monuments, music, and films.

P. Snow famously claimed that science and literature formed two antagonistic camps.  On one side was Tolstoy, who condemned science for not answering the only question that matters: &quot;What shall we do and how shall we live?&quot;  And on the other were scientists who dismissed literature as so much fluff, irrelevant for our technological age.  This course, by contrast, looks at the dialogue between science and literature in the twentieth century, from the rise of evolutionary science to the space race.  We will read fiction about science (some of it, science fiction!) as well as memoirs by great twentieth-century scientists.  To place these accounts in historical context, we will read essays by thinkers such as the sociologist Max Weber, the naturalist Thomas Huxley, the poet Matthew Arnold, and C. P. Snow.  We will ask how science and literature have approached the question of the good society and the good life, and how their answers can align?and how they differ.", "name": "First-Year Seminar-American History", "section": "22", "topic": "Science and Literature: The Good Society", "course": "102-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/102-6/24898", "instructor": ["Kenneth L Alder"], "id": "24898", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
