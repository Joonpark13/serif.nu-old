This course will focus on contemporary socio-political developments in Latin America in long-term historical context, and the different methodological approaches to researching and writing the history of the present. As freshman seminar, the class will be run as an open workshop that is writing- and discussion-oriented, and aimed to help first-year students to improve their analytical and critical abilities. Students work together through the specific challenges they encounter, and share the research and writing process as well as their final products with the class. Initially, we focus on the practical side of the &quot;historian's craft,&quot; and consider the sources, methods, and problems of research for Latin American and Caribbean history. Then we move into individual cases in order to consider how change and crisis in the late-twentieth and early twenty-first centuries is connected to earlier conjunctures. We examine current developments in the Andes (with particular attention to Bolivia, and Venezuela), the Caribbean (particularly Cuba), and Central America (specifically Mexico). The goal is to comprehend four major historical problems: the popular democratic mobilizations of impoverished working people, the election and trajectories of Left and center-Left governments, the expansive wave of terror of the illegal drug business, and U.S. foreign policy in the hemisphere. Finally, we explore the inextricably bound history of the Americas in order to understand one of the most politically charged issues of our present: Latin American immigration to the U.S."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendanceClass participationPaper, finalPapersAttendance and participation, response papers, oral presentations, in-class assignments, and a final paper"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Charles Bergquist, Labor and the Course of American Democracy: U.S. History in Latin American Perspective (1996) ISBN 1859841260 (pbk.) 1859848656<br/><br/><br/>Greg Grandin, Empire's Workshop: Latin America, the United States, and the Rise of the New Imperialism (2006) ISBN 0805077383<br/><br/><br/>Forrest Hylton and Sinclair Thomson, Revolutionary Horizons: Past and Present in Bolivian Politics (2007) ISBN 9781844670703 (hbk.) 1844670708 (hbk.) 184467097X (pbk.) 9781844670970 (pbk.)<br/><br/><br/>Steve Ellner, Rethinking Venezuelan Politics: Class, Conflict, and the Ch\u00e1vez Phenomenon (2008) ISBN 781588265609 (hardcover : alk. paper) 1588265609 (hardcover : alk. paper)<br/><br/><br/>Anabel Hern\u00e1ndez, Narcoland.
