P. Snow famously claimed that science and literature formed two antagonistic camps. On one side was Tolstoy, who condemned science for not answering the only question that matters: &quot;What shall we do and how shall we live?&quot; And on the other were scientists who dismissed literature as so much fluff, irrelevant for our technological age. This course, by contrast, looks at the dialogue between science and literature in the twentieth century, from the rise of evolutionary science to the space race. We will read fiction about science (some of it, science fiction!) as well as memoirs by great twentieth-century scientists. To place these accounts in historical context, we will read essays by thinkers such as the sociologist Max Weber, the naturalist Thomas Huxley, the poet Matthew Arnold, and C. P. Snow. We will ask how science and literature have approached the question of the good society and the good life, and how their answers can align?and how they differ."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationPaper, finalParticipation, several short essays, and one medium-length final paper"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Bertolt Brecht, Life of Galileo, ISBN: 9780143105381<br/><br/><br/>Lauren Redniss, Radioactive: Marie &amp; Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout, Paperback, It books 2010, ASIN: B004GY433Q<br/><br/><br/>Freeman Dyson, Disturbing the Universe, ISBN: 9780465016778<br/><br/><br/>Primo Levi, The Periodic Table, ISBN: 9780805210415<br/><br/><br/>C.
