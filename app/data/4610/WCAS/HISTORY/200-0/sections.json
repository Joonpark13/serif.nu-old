[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The course explores the historical relationship between human societies and energy. Consider the contemporary United States, for instance. Its citizens make up some 5 percent of the world's population but account for 25 percent of the world's energy consumption. Why? Is there something in American culture that predisposes it to high energy consumption, or has its high-intensity energy system made American culture? What is the relationship between the political, social, and cultural evolution of modern America, and the evolution of its energy systems? And what does that relationship look like in other parts of the world? Over the course of the semester, we will examine the history of energy around the world and the varied and evolving sociotechnical systems built up around it. We will grapple with the question of technological determinism, whether certain technologies make certain societies inevitable, or whether perhaps it is the other way around. Each week, we will explore one or two sources of energy, and see how they have interacted with the societies involved in their generation, distribution, and consumption. We will see how energy can shed light on topics as varied as geopolitical power relations, forms of government, war, labor organizing, gender roles, and notions of leisure.", "name": "New Introductory Courses in History", "section": "20", "topic": "Energy and Society: A Global History", "course": "200-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HISTORY/200-0/25045", "instructor": ["Fredrik   Meiton"], "id": "25045", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
