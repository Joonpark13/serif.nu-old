[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Students will read all seven extant plays (including Antigone and Oedipus the King) and one fragmentary play (Phaedra) of Athens' greatest dramatist, plus critical scholarship. An aristocrat in Athens, Sophocles' dramas performed to the masses are enmeshed in the problems and controversies of his city's democracy. What is the relationship of these texts to the democracy and to Athens' democratic leader Perikles, and how do their ideas change over time? No exams, but a weekly 1-3-page paper: either a critique of scholarship or an analysis of a play, which we then discuss in class. Students will learn about one of the world's greatest dramatists and the world's first democracy, while improving their skills in writing, critical thinking, and debate. Grades are based on the papers and class participation.
