His body of work spans decades, including cinematic masterpieces like Obsession (1943), Senso (1954), Rocco and His Brothers (1960), The Leopard (1963), and Death in Venice (1971), as well as a number of trailblazing theater and opera productions. A master of the melodramatic imagination, Visconti was always ahead of his times in showing the harrowing effects of love, passion, and betrayal as they take place in historically and socially specific contexts. All of his films distinguish themselves for their intellectual rigor, audiovisual splendor, and emotional force. This course will follow the developments of Visconti's cinematic style while paying close attention to the way his work exposes and transforms dominant conceptions of gender and sexuality. At the end of the course, we will turn to selected films by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Todd Haynes in order to assess Visconti's influence on younger generations' transgressive sexual politics."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:50 PM (CT)", "subject": "ITALIAN"}]
