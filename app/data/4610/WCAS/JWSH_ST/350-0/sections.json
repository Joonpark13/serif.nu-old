[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course explores the Holocaust as it is expressed in various genres: fiction, poetry, and testimony; fictional, autobiographical, and documentary film; and presentation by a Holocaust survivor. Working as a small group, we will examine artistic and ethical questions about representing the reality of the Holocaust and questions about how we make meaning from its horrific events and the roles of memory, language, and history. Because of the painful nature of the material, the course emphasizes small group work. Discussion and writing assignments will encourage students to share their responses so that we begin to understand different portrayals of victimization and survival as well as relationships between ourselves and our readings and films. Course readings and Professor Lassner supply the historical contexts necessary to approach our subject.", "name": "Representing the Holocaust in Literature and Film", "section": "20", "location": "University Library 4670", "topic": "", "course": "350-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM", "Tu 6:30PM - 9:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/JWSH_ST/350-0/23544", "instructor": ["Phyllis B Lassner"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "23544", "subject": "JWSH_ST"}]
