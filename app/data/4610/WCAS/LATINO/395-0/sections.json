[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is designed to help students critically examine the discipline of Latino Studies, its development as a field of study, its institutionalization, and some of its central intellectual concerns. We will read from texts focused on Latino populations and issues in the U.S., but pay close attention to texts that allow us to understand the development of the discipline - both historically and in the contemporary.  Readings are drawn from a variety of scholarly fields and popular genres and are complemented by guest lectures, films, and student participation.", "name": "Capstone Seminar in Latina &amp; Latino Studies", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/LATINO/395-0/24766", "instructor": ["Ana L Aparicio"], "id": "24766", "subject": "LATINO"}]
