We will read from texts focused on Latino populations and issues in the U.S., but pay close attention to texts that allow us to understand the development of the discipline - both historically and in the contemporary. Readings are drawn from a variety of scholarly fields and popular genres and are complemented by guest lectures, films, and student participation."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Case studiesClass participationDiscussionFilms / videosGroup workGuest speakersPresentationsReadingsResearch projectSeminarWriting assignments"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendanceClass participationGroup workHomeworkPaper, finalPapersPresentationsReadingsResearch projectWriting assignments"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "?
