A master of the melodramatic imagination, Visconti was always ahead of his times in showing the harrowing effects of love, passion, and betrayal as the take place in historically and socially specific contexts. All of his films distinguish themselves for their intellectual rigor, audiovisual splendor, and emotional force. This course will follow the developments of Visconti's cinematic style while paying close attention to the ways his work exposes and transforms dominant conceptions of gender and sexuality. At the end of the course, we will turn to selected films by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Todd Haynes in order to assess Visconti's influence on younger generations' transgressive sexual politics.", "qtr": "Winter 2016", "name": "Studies in Theme", "title": "WCAS COMP_LIT 304-0-21 Studies in Theme", "lmod": "1/9/16 6:45 PM (CT)", "section": "21", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-8269", "instructor_name": "Domietta   Torlasco", "instructor_addr": "1860 S.
