[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will explore selected themes and aesthetic trends in Brazilian literature and film (but mostly film) produced in the 21st century. We will be particularly interested in discussing how in the last decade both literature and film have blurred the boundaries between fiction and documentary, with an increasing emphasis on social and historical issues.  We will also pay close attention to the development of realism through the 20th-century and the important role attained by documentary film making in the last decade.  Although we will pay some attention to film techniques, our major concern will be with narrative strategies and ideological content.  Class meetings will rely heavily on class discussions in a seminar format.<br/><br/>Students will have the opportunity to do their readings and write their papers in English or Portuguese.", "name": "World Cinemas", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "305-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/COMP_LIT/305-0/23201", "instructor": ["Cesar A Braga-Pinto"], "id": "23201", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
