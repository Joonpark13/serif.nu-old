This seminar will be devoted to films and videos that have contributed to the emergence of new forms of visual thought, from Chris Marker's Sans Soleil and Jean-Luc Godard's Sc\u00e9nario du film Passion to Agnes Varda's The Gleaners and I. As we follow the trail set b these works, we will read texts by Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, and Roland Barthes, among others. We will also consider essayistic experiments in the fields of photography, performance, and installation art. Because we stand at a pivotal juncture in the reconfiguration of our mediatic landscape, particular attention will be given to those works that problematize the relation between the analog and the digital."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
