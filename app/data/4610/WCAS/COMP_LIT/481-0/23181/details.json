We will then discuss how the relationships between discursive, institutional and aesthetic practices and their pragmatic effects are rethought in the writings of such theorists as Foucault, Ranci\u00e8re and Deleuze. While the primary focus of the course will be on theoretical texts, these texts will also be considered in dialogue with literary and cinematic works."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
