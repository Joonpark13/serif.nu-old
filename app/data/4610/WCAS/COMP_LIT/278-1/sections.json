[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The course aims to explore the poetic, the ideological and the gender implications of the interwoven themes of eros and isolation in Hebrew Literature from the turn of the 19th century to the present day. In doing so, we shall study the migration of these themes along with Hebrew Literature itself from Europe to Palestine and ultimately the State of Israel. Has the rebuilding of the national \"Home\" brought the uprooted man his long lost masculinity? And how did the female writer incorporate/become incorporated by the \"Talush\" narrative? How do we account for the longevity of this sad and pathetic figure? This course provides an excellent introduction to Modern Hebrew Literature per se: we shall read classic texts by M.Y. Berdichevsky, Y.H. Brenner, S.Y. Agnon, alongside contemporary texts by A.B Yehoshua and David Grossman and others.", "name": "Modern Hebrew Literature in Translation", "section": "20", "location": "No Room Needed", "topic": "Tales of Love and Darkness", "course": "278-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/COMP_LIT/278-1/23175", "instructor": ["Marcus G Moseley", "Yael   Dekel"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "23175", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
