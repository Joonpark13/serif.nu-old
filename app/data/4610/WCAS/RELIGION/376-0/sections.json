[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Why is modernity usually linked to the loss of religion? In this course we consider the question of how religion, primarily European Christianity, contributed new ways of thinking, being, and acting to the emerging understanding of what it means to be modern. The period we focus on begins with the turbulent religious reformations of the early sixteenth century. At this time three new Christian confessions were born?Lutheran, Reformed, Roman Catholic?each with distinct contributions to the idea of modernity. Subsequent history witnessed the political reconfiguring of the European map, the expansion of economic capitalism, religious wars, and new ideas about religion in relation to reason, culture, and history. We thus explore modernity by considering reflections on religion as they emerged in this new historical context. The authors studied are are some of the most famous in the history of modernity: Luther, Calvin, Avila, Locke, Kant, Spener, Schleiermacher.", "name": "Christianity and the Making of Modernity", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "376-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/RELIGION/376-0/26840", "instructor": ["Christine M Helmer"], "id": "26840", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
