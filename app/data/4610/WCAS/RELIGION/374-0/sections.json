[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "<u>Evolutionary Spirituality: Science, Cooperation, Morality and God</u><br/>This course addresses the growing awareness of the universality of evolution in all existence.  This awareness recognizes the sequential emergence of values-based stages in human cultural development, the development of life forms, and the development of prebiotic forms back to the big bang.  We shall explore some of the impact of this way of seeing things.  We shall take on the conflict between science and religion, as demonstrated in the varying ways Darwin's work is viewed today.  We shall discover the ways this view assists in our interactions with others, as revealed in game theory models.  And we shall ponder the new understandings of the divine that evolution stimulates.  The possibilities for new syntheses and future development will emerge from these readings, along with new cooperative relationships within the world and its religions.", "name": "Contemporary Religious Thought", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 214", "topic": "Evolutionary Spirituality: Science", "course": "374-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/RELIGION/374-0/26885", "instructor": ["Beverly P Mortensen"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "26885", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
