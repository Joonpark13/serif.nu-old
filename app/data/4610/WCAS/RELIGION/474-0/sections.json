Why do mystical ideas travel from the periphery of an ethnic group to the center, galvanizing the masses and triggering the rise of new sects and messianic movements? What is the impact of mystical beliefs and practices on the emerging modernity and anti-modernity? Why has the deeply Kabbalistic concept <i>tikkun loam</i> (fixing the world) become a major thinking tool of modern liberal Jews? To answer these questions, we will discuss Jewish mysticism-in-the-making after the destruction of the Second Temple, explore the formation of Kabbalah in late medieval Spain, and travel to the circle of the Lurianic mystics in Safed (Tzfat). We will study specific early modern and modern historical contexts in which various forms of mystical practices emerged, underscore the historicity of mystical texts and practices, and introduce Judaic sectarian and messianic movements built on these practices?including the Kabbalists (Judaic and Christian), the Sabbateans, the Frankists, the Hasidim, and the Religious Zionists. This course will focus mainly on the socio-cultural, political, and practical/behavioral aspects of the mystical groups and messianic movements. Explore how Judaic mystical endeavors helped early modern and modern Jews revisit their traditional texts, redefine their rites and practices, and change the profile of the Jewish people in their encounter with modernity.", "qtr": "Winter 2016", "name": "Studies in Judaism", "title": "WCAS RELIGION 474-0-20 Studies in Judaism", "lmod": "1/9/16 6:53 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/467-3399", "instructor_name": "Yohanan   Petrovsky-Shtern", "instructor_addr": "Harris Hall 317"}], "topic": "Mysticism and Hasidism", "course": "474-0", "enrl_requirement": "<br/>Add Consent: Department Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "How do socio-cultural conditions shape distinct mystical worldview and why?
