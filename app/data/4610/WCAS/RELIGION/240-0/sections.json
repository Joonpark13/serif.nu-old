[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an introduction to the history of Christianity. In the first part of this course we will explore the history of Christian beliefs, institutions, and contexts. We will trace the roots of the contemporary varieties of western Christianity and distinguish among the three main branches of contemporary Christianity (Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Orthodox).  We&#39;ll interrupt this history to explore briefly some religious practices of each branch and their connection with religious spaces.  The course concludes with a study of the ways Christianity in the U.S. has been shaped by (and in many cases has shaped) colonization, assimilation, modernity, and other forces.", "name": "Introduction to Christianity", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "240-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/RELIGION/240-0/26836", "instructor": ["Katherine Anne Dugan"], "id": "26836", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
