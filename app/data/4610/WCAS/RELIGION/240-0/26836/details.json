In the first part of this course we will explore the history of Christian beliefs, institutions, and contexts. We will trace the roots of the contemporary varieties of western Christianity and distinguish among the three main branches of contemporary Christianity (Protestant, Roman Catholic, and Orthodox). We&#39;ll interrupt this history to explore briefly some religious practices of each branch and their connection with religious spaces.
