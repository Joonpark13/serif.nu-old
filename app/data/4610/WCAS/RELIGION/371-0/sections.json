[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "<u>Religious Belief and Practice on Screen</u><br/>We will explore the &quot;religious&quot; backgrounds and assumptions of films that pose universal ethical questions. In a few cases, <i>Day of Wrath</i> by Carl Theo. Dreyer, for instance, the plot unfolds within a Protestant community. Westerns such as Eastwood&#39;s operate within an American Protestant ethos. Catholicism on Film includes Kieslowski&#39;s Dekalog and Hausner&#39;s Lourdes. Iranian films (A Separation) present underlying conflicts between practitioners of conservative Islam and a secular worldview, each concerned with problems of relationship and responsibility. The Dardennes, reared in the Catholic tradition, mute obvious representations in favor of compassionate humanism (The Son). Petzold&#39;s Phoenix exposes the fragility of personal and religious &quot;identity,&quot; historical memory, betrayal, and justice after war. A final section comprises anti-war films that simultaneously attract viewers by their seductive beauty and sear the conscience.", "name": "Religion and Film", "section": "20", "topic": "Religious Belief and Practice on Scree", "course": "371-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:00PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/RELIGION/371-0/26884", "instructor": ["Sara A Vaux"], "id": "26884", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
