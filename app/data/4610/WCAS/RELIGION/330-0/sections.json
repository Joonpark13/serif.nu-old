We will get to know genres such as translation, pseudo-ephigrapha, allegory, pesher, and Midrash, and examine texts that range from the Bible itself to Hellenistic philosophy, from the Dead Sea Scrolls to the Talmud, and from the New Testament to modern film. Beyond acquisition of familiarity with these texts and the world in which they were composed, the main goal of the class is to understand the process of interpretation of scripture and to acquire tools to examine interpretation in a critical way. The message that will be emphasized over and over again in the class is that <i>interpretation of a text tells us mainly about the interpreter,</i> not about the text that is being interpreted, and that the drama of the text takes place not within it, but within the encounter between text and reader. In essence, then, this is a class about reading, and about <i>writing as a way of reading.</i>"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Class participationDiscussionReadingsWriting assignments"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendanceClass participation: 20% of final grade<br/>Papers: Three papers (10%, 20%, 25%)<br/>Writing assignments: 10 short writing assignments (25%)<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Bible (NRSV version)<br/> <br/>HARPERCOLLINS STUDY BIBLE-NRSV-REV.+UPD, By BIBLE <br/>EDITION: REV 06<br/>PUBLISHER: HARP PUB<br/>ISBN: 9780060786847<br/><br/>TABLES OF THE LAW, By MANN<br/>EDITION: 10<br/>PUBLISHER: PERSEUS D<br/>ISBN: 9781589880573"}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/RELIGION/330-0/26837", "instructor": ["Mira   Balberg"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "26837", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
