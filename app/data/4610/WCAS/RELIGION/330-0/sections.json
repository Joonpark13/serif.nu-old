[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Oftentimes when we think of Scripture or Sacred Literature we think of writings that resist any sort of change or intervention, writings that are fixed not only in their wording but also in their meaning. However, when we examine the literature composed by Jews in antiquity, we see that nothing could be further from this description. Throughout antiquity, the Hebrew Bible, <i>because</i> it was seen as a sacred and authoritative text, was constantly being rewritten. Various authors, each with their own agenda, ideology, convictions, and creative inclinations, have ventured to retell the biblical stories, to reconstruct the biblical laws, and to present the biblical texts anew - not with the purpose of replacing Scripture but with the purpose of making Scripture resonate with their own world and come to life as a powerful source of meaning. This phenomenon of rewriting the Bible so as to approach it through changing lenses and concerns continues to this day, as we can see through contemporary literature and film.", "name": "Varieties of Ancient Judaism", "section": "20", "topic": "Rewriting the Bible", "course": "330-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/RELIGION/330-0/26837", "instructor": ["Mira   Balberg"], "id": "26837", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
