[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What does it mean to be a ?modern&#8217; Muslim? How might this be different from merely being a Muslim in the ?modern world&#8217;? Are there ways in which Muslims have attempted to make modernity their own, as it were, by articulating an ?Islamic&#8217; modernity or modernities? This course attempts to answer these questions by exploring how Muslims have variously engaged, adapted and resisted ?modernity&#8217; in various contexts and locales. After surveying some major scholarly theories of modernity, we will focus on three broad domains of ?the modern&#8217; in Islam: gender, law and the state.", "name": "Topics in Islam", "section": "1", "topic": "Islamic Modernities", "course": "359-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/RELIGION/359-0/26839", "instructor": ["Brannon Dobbs Ingram"], "id": "26839", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
