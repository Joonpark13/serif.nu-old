[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Civil Society in East Asia: A Historical and Critical Perspective<br/><br/>The concept of civil society is heard everyday and in different kinds of occasions.  Civil society represents not only a physical and social space but also an ideal in which freedom of human beings is fully exercised. The concept is also used widely by intellectuals, politicians and activists in contemporary East Asia societies. The course offers an understanding on the development of the civil society in East Asia from a comparative perspective. Particularly, we will focus on four East Asian societies?Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China. The focus of the course is both social scientific and historical. Students will be asked to read empirical studies that examine the development of civil society as well as the historical work on the formation of a specific element of civil society (e.g., social movement).<br/><br/>The course begins with introducing theoretical perspectives on the history and development of the concept of civil society as used in the Western liberal tradition. We will emphasize the American experience and use America as our reference point for comparison for the second half of the course. We pay special attention to several closely related terms (e.g., non-governmental organizations (NGOs), nonprofits). The second part of the course is empirically organized around the four Asian societies. We will emphasize three important dimensions of the civil society in each of the four societies: the state-society relationship, the strength of civil associations, and the social movements. In recent years, student movement has been the dominant form of social protest in several East Asian societies. The course will offer an opportunity for students to explore the origin of the rise of student activism from the perspective of civil society. Finally, we will discuss to the emergence of trans-regional civil society in East Asia and evaluate the impact of the trans-regional and transnational civil society on the domestic societies.", "name": "Advanced Topics in Asian Studies", "section": "20", "topic": "Civil Societies in East Asia: A Comparative Perspe", "course": "390-3", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ASIAN_ST/390-3/22907", "instructor": ["Cheng-Pang   Lee"], "id": "22907", "subject": "ASIAN_ST"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "Advanced Topics in Asian Studies", "section": "21", "topic": "Med Tourism &amp; Transn'l Sex'lty", "course": "390-3", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ASIAN_ST/390-3/22908", "instructor": ["Jillana B Enteen"], "id": "22908", "subject": "ASIAN_ST"}]
