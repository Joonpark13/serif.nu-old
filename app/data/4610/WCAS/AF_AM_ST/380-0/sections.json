[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines the relationship between food, land, systems of racial domination, and ideas of freedom and self-determination.   The class will include an examination of agricultural chattel slavery,  food in Black nationalist and Black power movements (i.e. the Black Panthers' breakfast programs), racialized industrial agriculture, and contemporary food justice movements.  Overall, we will wrestle with the ways in which food and land have represented possibilities for people of color's self-determination, as well as have been sites of profound oppression.", "name": "Topics in African-American Studies", "section": "20", "topic": "Food Fights - Food, Land + Race is US", "course": "380-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/AF_AM_ST/380-0/26463", "instructor": ["Jessica   Quizar"], "id": "26463", "subject": "AF_AM_ST"}]
