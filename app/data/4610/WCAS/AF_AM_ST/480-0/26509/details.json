We'll begin with a brief genealogy of western modernity and of modern nation states like the U.S., an effort to excavate their racial/colonial architecture and thus expose their systemic and routine affects and effects (slavery, genocide, hyper-carceralism, alienation, and etc). Thereafter, most of our time will be spent mapping and debating decolonial theories and methods, focusing on; native resistance, fugitivity or maroonage, border/hybrid knowledge, racial power movements (Black, Chican@...), the undercommons, and emergent intellectual collectives (critical ethnic studies; afro-pessimism; crunk feminist, Palestinian, settler colonial?)"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "DiscussionLecture"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:42 PM (CT)", "subject": "AF_AM_ST"}]
