This course will teach the basic concepts and skills underlying description of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium using Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics, including microscopic definition of entropy, and the development of microcanonical, canonical and grand canonical ensembles. Applications of statistical mechanics to ideal quantum and classical gases, nonideal gases, and magnetic spin systems including paramagnets and ferromagnets will be discussed.
