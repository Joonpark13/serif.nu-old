Beyond its political effects, left-wing terrorism also strongly affected the culture and thought of West Germany, which had hitherto presented itself as a constitutional democracy polity that had successfully \"overcome\" the traumas of the Nazi era. The seminar traces the history of political terrorism in post-war German society and also tries to locate it within a larger framework of militant protests throughout Europe and the world. Particular attention will be given to the actions of the infamous Red Army Faction (RAF) which also left its mark in German popular culture. While the RAF and other left-wing groups of the 1960s and 1970s are the main focus of the class, we will also talk about the disquieting phenomenon of right-wing terrorism, currently a much-discussed topic in Germany because of the ongoing revelations about the National Socialist Underground (NSU).", "qtr": "Winter 2016", "name": "Contemporary Germany", "title": "WCAS GERMAN 224-0-20 Contemporary Germany", "lmod": "1/9/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/467-7067", "instructor_name": "Jan   Behrs", "instructor_addr": "1800 Sherman, Suite 106, Room 105"}], "topic": "Political Extremism", "course": "224-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "The emergence of political extremism in West Germany during the late 1960s and early 1970s struck at the core of Germany society and reverberated through the Western world.
