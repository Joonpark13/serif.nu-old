[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines Prague, one of the most beautiful and culturally vibrant cities in Europe.  The city`s magnificent streets and buildings, however, both conceal and reveal a past full of multiethnic coexistence and interethnic conflict.  The goal of our course will be to understand how Prague's various communities built the city and its culture(s) and how they struggled to control it.<br/>The course will follow the twentieth-century transformation of the city from Cosmopolitan and Bourgeois Prague to Nazi and Communist Prague to Revolutionary and Capitalist Prague.  We will read a range of literary and historical sources, including writings by Bohumil Hrabal, V\u00e1clav Havel, Franz Kafka and Milan Kundera.  We will also watch films set on the city`s streets and squares.", "name": "German Contributions to World Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L05", "topic": "Prague: City of Cultures, City of Conflict", "course": "322-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/GERMAN/322-0/23373", "instructor": ["Martina F Kerlova"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>Given in English<br/><br/>", "id": "23373", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
