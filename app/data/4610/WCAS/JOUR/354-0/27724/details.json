Conversely, sports make media. The rise of mass media in 19th century America paralleled and its creators promoted the development of the major American sports, particularly baseball and football, and in the digital world sport is the only form of programming that still commands national and global audiences that number in the billions. As a result, sport is a social institution no less than education, religion, or the military, and no less important, though its functions vary across cultures, and vestiges of primitive sport remain everywhere. This is a research and writing course, with no final exam. Course materials include scholarly and popular publications, and documentary films."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:50 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
