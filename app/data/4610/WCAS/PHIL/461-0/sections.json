[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Topic: Marx and Marxism<br/>Judged to be dead in the heyday of neo-liberalism and the seeming global post-Cold War triumph of market ideology, left theory has made an impressive comeback in recent years. Witness the concern about the growing chasm between rich and poor in Western nations, and the spectacle of a self-proclaimed socialist drawing huge crowds on the U.S. campaign trail. Karl Marx's ideas about macro historical patterns, globalization, economic tendencies within capitalist society, commodification and alienation, the power of the privileged classes, the role of dominant ideologies, and the possibility of a radically new social order are thus arguably as relevant as ever. In this course, we will focus on trying to get clear on some of the key concepts within Marx's thought, and how well they stand up today.", "name": "Seminar in Social and Political Theory", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "461-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:30PM - 5:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/PHIL/461-0/23790", "instructor": ["Charles W Mills"], "id": "23790", "subject": "PHIL"}]
