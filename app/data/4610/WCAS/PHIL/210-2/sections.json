[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course you will discover a fascinating thousand-year span of the history of philosophy that is often overlooked: medieval philosophy in both the Latin and the Arabic speaking world. This period of philosophy is perhaps most famous for its proofs of the existence of god. We certainly will consider those, but we will give equal attention to the origins of the notions of a will and of free will. We will examine medieval views of the value of philosophy for living our daily lives. We will discuss the nature of perception, cognition, the soul, and the cosmos. And we will reflect on how medieval philosophical theories are importantly different from ancient theories, while at the same time evolving out of them. Our understanding of medieval philosophy, in turn, will help you better appreciate early modern philosophy, which evolved out of and in response to medieval philosophy.", "name": "History of Philosophy - Medieval", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 122", "topic": "", "course": "210-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/PHIL/210-2/23672", "instructor": ["David Buckley Ebrey"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "23672", "subject": "PHIL"}]
