[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "We will consider how we are to act towards others.  Drawing on both classic and contemporary readings in philosophy, as well as our own experiences, we will ask what it means to live a moral life in different spheres and situations.  Do we have, or can we justify, special obligations to our friends and family?  Do our professional and other roles shape what we have reason to do?  How do we understand our obligations towards strangers?  Is there some unified way to understand the reasons that should guide us in all of these spheres, or do they operate independently?", "name": "The Brady Scholars Program", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 303", "topic": "The Moral Life", "course": "273-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/PHIL/273-2/23791", "instructor": ["Kyla Sue Ebels Duggan"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "23791", "subject": "PHIL"}]
