[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In 150, you learned how to prove that certain arguments are valid and how to show that some others are not valid (by providing counter-examples). In 250, we develop this toolkit further in a number of directions.  We will see how the logic you learned in 150 can be applied to produce a number of interesting results, including its ability to describe basic facts about arithmetic.  We will see how to really prove that 1=1=2!  We will also look at how it can be used to describe complicated notions of infinity, and how there really are different sizes of infinity!  We will also learn alternative ways of thinking about the apparatus of logic, especially, ways of thinking about logic in terms of what the logical words mean, rather than in terms of systems of deduction.  We will explore some limitations of the logic you learned in 150, and see some things it cannot do, and why not. Finally, we will examine some ways of expanding the resources of logic beyond what you saw in 150, which overcome some of these limitation, but at significant costs.", "name": "Elementary Logic II", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "250-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/PHIL/250-0/23675", "instructor": ["Michael John Glanzberg"], "id": "23675", "subject": "PHIL"}]
