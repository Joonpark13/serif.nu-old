We will see how to really prove that 1=1=2!  We will also look at how it can be used to describe complicated notions of infinity, and how there really are different sizes of infinity!  We will also learn alternative ways of thinking about the apparatus of logic, especially, ways of thinking about logic in terms of what the logical words mean, rather than in terms of systems of deduction.  We will explore some limitations of the logic you learned in 150, and see some things it cannot do, and why not.
