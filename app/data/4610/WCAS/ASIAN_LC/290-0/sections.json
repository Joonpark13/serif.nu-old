[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Modern Chinese Popular Cultures is a two-quarter series on the popular cultures of mainland China?and to a lesser extent, Hong Kong and Taiwan?from the late nineteenth century through the present day. Part I, which takes the completion of World War II as its end point, explores not only the cultural products that found favor with the public?the truly popular?but also a broader selection of works influenced by or produced using the &quot;new media&quot; most closely associated with the popular culture of this period: especially sound recording, film, photography and mass print media. Part II follows the development of those forms and media in a broader sinophone context. We will consider works influenced by and produced using these media in light of a series of related questions: What makes a medium new? What is the relationship between &quot;new&quot; and its implied other, &quot;old&quot;? Between &quot;Western&quot; technology and &quot;Chinese&quot; traditions? Between high and low culture? Between entertainment and ideology? This course is designed to not only introduce the history of cultural production in (and of) Modern China but also help students hone their close reading, listening and viewing skills and to improve their analytical and critical writing abilities.", "name": "Introductory Topics in Asian Languages and Cultures", "section": "20", "topic": "Modern Chinese Pop Cult 1949-Present Day", "course": "290-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ASIAN_LC/290-0/22841", "instructor": ["Corey   Byrnes"], "id": "22841", "subject": "ASIAN_LC"}]
