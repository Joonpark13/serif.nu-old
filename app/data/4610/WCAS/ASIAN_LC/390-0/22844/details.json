This course offers an intensive training program in these three abilities, a program geared towards students in Asian and comparative literary studies who wish to pursue independent research projects (and thereby demonstrate the higher-level research skills prized by employers, granting agencies, and graduate admissions committees). <br/>At the most basic level, this is a classic research methods course, where you will strengthen the skills necessary to complete a full, ten-week research project. Through short weekly exercises, we will break down and workshop each component of the research process?e.g., how to convert an area of interest into a specific topic, how to apply for research funding, how to write an abstract, how to compile a bibliography, etc. These exercises will culminate in a twelve-page research paper (or its equivalent in other formats). Our work in research methods will provide a springboard for readings and discussion about how we can critique or change existing methods for producing knowledge. Such questions include: How do problems of orientation provide the basis for making the Orient an object of knowledge and power? How do different media exert and distribute &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; power? What kinds of knowledge production have supported colonialism and imperialism? And what alternatives exist for decolonizing or democratizing knowledge?<br/> <br/>Note: As a class of this kind has not been offered in DALC before, students interested in reading evaluations of a similar course in English may wish to consult the instructor's CTECs for English 397."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "The student will be able to define a research topic; refine a research topic into a specific set of research questions; collect manuscript, print, and digital sources; compile an annotated bibliography; provide effective feedback to peers; and present research in oral and written form."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion of readings and workshopping of student assignments."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation; for-credit weekly research exercises; graded rough draft, oral presentation, and final draft of a research paper (~15 pages)."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "1) A course reader of short weekly readings (in English) from such writers as B.R.
