How do residents of India themselves know what they know about the vast land they inhabit, with its various sub-cultures and ethnic groups? As a perennially popular literary genre, travel writing has played a prominent role in the production of this knowledge. In this course, we will read travel writing on and from South Asia to ask how it produces representations of India and offers it to readers for consumption. Course materials will include both historical travel writing from authors like Mark Twain, Rabindranath Tagore and Queen Sikandar Begum, as well as more contemporary works like Eat, Pray, Love and City of Djinns. By the end of the course, students should have a clear understanding of the place of travel writing in modern literature on India, and how this genre has helped structure the way we know this region today."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "?
