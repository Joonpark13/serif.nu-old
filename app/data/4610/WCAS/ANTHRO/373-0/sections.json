[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course provides an entr\u00e9e into the changing politics and cultures of American urban life, with a special focus on urban political economy, ethnographic knowledge, urban space and neighborhoods, recent demographic and economic trends?especially rising economic inequalities-on key stratifications by race, class, gender, ethnicity, nationality, and sexuality, and on the shifting American public sphere. With this ethnographic, social scientific, and historical grounding, to which I will add with focused lectures, we will have intensive, seminar-style discussions, and also hear from the celebrated Chicago journalist Ben Joravsky. Midterm and final will be take-home, &quot;think&quot; exercises. Prerequisite: Anthropology 212, 211 or other cultural/social anthropology courses, or another introductory course in sociology or American history.", "name": "Power and Culture in American Cities", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "373-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 5:00PM - 8:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ANTHRO/373-0/25168", "instructor": ["Micaela   di Leonardo"], "id": "25168", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
