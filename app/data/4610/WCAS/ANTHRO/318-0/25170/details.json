Among other topics, we will look at the remains of <br/><br/>medieval field systems, villages and hamlets; the houses of peasants and lords; churches great and <br/><br/>small; and pottery and other artifacts. The course material will be interdisciplinary: students will look at <br/><br/>the evidence of archaeological excavations, survey of standing buildings, analysis of maps and aerial <br/><br/>photos, and landscape, social, economic and architectural history. The course will consider Europe as a <br/><br/>whole, but there will be an emphasis on medieval England and her neighbors in north-west Europe."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Open to graduate students as well."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:43 PM (CT)", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
