This course introduces students to the Maghreb through text and <br/><br/>expressive culture (film and music). Required readings will include one book or its equivalent in articles <br/><br/>per week, drawing from anthropology, creative fiction and non-fiction, and history. Course themes <br/><br/>include multilingualism, gender, law, rural-urban relations, ethnicity, religion, and French colonialism. In-<br/><br/>depth study of Amazigh (?Berber') and rural populations will complement the study of Arab and urban <br/><br/>populations in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Assessments are based on weekly response papers, <br/><br/>participation, discussion facilitation, and a final research paper."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Non-anthro undergrads need instructor consent."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:43 PM (CT)", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
