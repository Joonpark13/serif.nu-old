[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In the 21st century, what we call &quot;environment&quot;, &quot;ecology&quot;, or &quot;nature&quot; in the Euro-Atlantic world consists of complex and fraught assemblages of social and material connections that have a history. While the meaning of these terms may appear static or straightforward, the significance, value, and even materiality of what falls under the designation of &quot;environment&quot; is under constant socio-political and scientific negotiation. Nothing makes this more evident than today's ongoing political battles over climate change, resource use, contamination, and conservation. To situate the terms that describe the more-than-human world around us, this course examines both the historical construction of the terms in the title, as well as other configurations of human-nonhuman relations of other societies and cultures.  Doing so will trouble our assumed separation between &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;culture&quot; and challenge us to think through present-day environmental politics in new and different ways. As a survey-type course, we will read a variety of socio-cultural anthropology texts, including classic studies and recent publications. A familiarity with basic concepts of sociocultural anthropology is assumed.", "name": "Environmental Anthropology", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "383-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ANTHRO/383-0/27694", "instructor": ["Stefanie Toney Graeter"], "id": "27694", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
