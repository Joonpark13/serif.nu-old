This ethnography-based course focuses on actors who seek individual or collective rights and <br/><br/>recognition through legal and paralegal means, and the social processes and changes that affect them <br/><br/>through a broad, cross-cultural approach to both &quot;law&quot; and &quot;human rights.&quot; Case studies concern <br/><br/>refugees, indigenous peoples, political opponents, children and women, religious minorities, and other <br/><br/>marginalized populations. The concept and pursuit of human rights through legal advocacy, <br/><br/>humanitarianism, and individual narrative is considered through international units such as the <br/><br/>European Court, the United Nations, and the World Bank, as well as at local and state levels. Course <br/><br/>requirements include weekly response papers, seminar participation, discussion facilitation, and a final <br/><br/>paper."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Advanced undergrads and non-anthro graduate students need instructor consent."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:43 PM (CT)", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
