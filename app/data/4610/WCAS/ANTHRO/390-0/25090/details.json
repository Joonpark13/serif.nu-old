Alongside the Statue of Liberty (on whose pedestal Lazarus' words are etched) and Ellis Island, they are often called upon by those seeking to point out that the United States is a nation of immigrants. However, popular discourse and policies regarding immigration to the United States have consistently vacillated between welcoming newcomers and rejecting &quot;the immigrant menace.&quot; Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, while some groups of immigrants were depicted favorably as new Americans and offered important forms of support, others were vilified and marked as forever foreign. This course will explore contemporary immigration, particularly how immigrants and immigration processes are portrayed in the public sphere. We will use ethnographic work, fiction, autobiography, popular press accounts, politicians' campaign speeches, and film to understand the significance of particular narratives of immigrant America in the 21st century."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "First come, first served."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:43 PM (CT)", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
