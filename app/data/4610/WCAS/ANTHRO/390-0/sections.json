What processes led to this extreme diversification? What can we learn about human biology from studying it? In this course we will examine the behavior and ecology of non-human primates in a range of contexts, including nutrition, cognition, sociality, and conservation. We will begin with an overview of the Primate order that describes relationships between families of primates. We will then shift our focus to behavioral and ecological theory, integrating discussions of both classic studies and current research topics. At the end of this course, you will appreciate the abundant variation in behavior and ecology that exists across the Primate order, understand theories explaining the proximate and ultimate causes of this variation, and recognize how studies of non-human primates impact our perspectives on human behavior and ecology.", "qtr": "Winter 2016", "name": "Topics In Anthropology", "title": "WCAS ANTHRO 390-0-21 Topics In Anthropology", "lmod": "1/9/16 6:43 PM (CT)", "section": "21", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "TBA", "instructor_name": "Katherine Ryan Amato", "instructor_addr": "1810 Hinman Avenue, Room A62"}], "topic": "Primate Ecology", "course": "390-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "How do colobus monkeys eat mostly leaves and seeds while spider monkeys specialize on fruit?
