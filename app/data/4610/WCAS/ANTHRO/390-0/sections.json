[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "How do colobus monkeys eat mostly leaves and seeds while spider monkeys specialize on fruit? Why do marmosets live in pair-bonded family groups while geladas live in multi-level societies? Within the Primate order an astounding range of behaviors and ecological strategies are represented. What processes led to this extreme diversification? What can we learn about human biology from studying it? In this course we will examine the behavior and ecology of non-human primates in a range of contexts, including nutrition, cognition, sociality, and conservation. We will begin with an overview of the Primate order that describes relationships between families of primates. We will then shift our focus to behavioral and ecological theory, integrating discussions of both classic studies and current research topics. At the end of this course, you will appreciate the abundant variation in behavior and ecology that exists across the Primate order, understand theories explaining the proximate and ultimate causes of this variation, and recognize how studies of non-human primates impact our perspectives on human behavior and ecology.", "name": "Topics In Anthropology", "section": "21", "topic": "Primate Ecology", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ANTHRO/390-0/25089", "instructor": ["Katherine Ryan Amato"], "id": "25089", "subject": "ANTHRO"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "&quot;Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free.&quot; Those lines from Emma Lazarus' sonnet, &quot;The New Colossus,&quot; are well known to most Americans. Alongside the Statue of Liberty (on whose pedestal Lazarus' words are etched) and Ellis Island, they are often called upon by those seeking to point out that the United States is a nation of immigrants. However, popular discourse and policies regarding immigration to the United States have consistently vacillated between welcoming newcomers and rejecting &quot;the immigrant menace.&quot; Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, while some groups of immigrants were depicted favorably as new Americans and offered important forms of support, others were vilified and marked as forever foreign. This course will explore contemporary immigration, particularly how immigrants and immigration processes are portrayed in the public sphere. We will use ethnographic work, fiction, autobiography, popular press accounts, politicians' campaign speeches, and film to understand the significance of particular narratives of immigrant America in the 21st century.", "name": "Topics In Anthropology", "section": "22", "topic": "", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ANTHRO/390-0/25090", "instructor": ["Ana L Aparicio"], "id": "25090", "subject": "ANTHRO"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Knowledge of human osteology forms the basis of physical and forensic anthropology, bioarchaeology, paleoanthropology and clinical anatomy.

This course will explore cultural aspects of environmental resource policy, covering the history of cultural resource management in the United States including the National Historic Preservation Act, language and cultural preservation, Native American sovereignty, mitigating natural resources, cultural patrimony, and Traditional Cultural Properties. We will also discuss ethical issues that arise from multiple perspectives of culturally significant landscapes, places, beliefs and practices. The course will examine the main debates around protecting and preserving cultural and natural resources.
