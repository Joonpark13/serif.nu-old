Yes! This course will explore the fundamental controls on distribution, diversity, and activity of microbes across the Earth. We will focus on the dynamics within and between populations including ecological interactions between microbes and other microbes, higher organisms, and geochemical fluxes. The course will culminate in a survey of the ecology of microbe-rich environments on Earth today including the ocean, soils, the subsurface, extreme environments, and the human body!"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "At least one quarter each of chemistry, biology and earth science coursework."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Take this course with EARTH 317 Biogeochemistry for maximum benefit"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "EARTH"}]
