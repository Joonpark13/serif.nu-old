While its use is trans-disciplinary, the course will focus on how to apply GIS techniques to important scientific questions in the environmental sciences. Specifically, students are introduced to exemplar problems in climate science, hydrology, geochemistry, and ecology that require geospatial analysis. Using these authentic scientific tasks as a motivational context, students learn the basic techniques for both acquiring and analyzing vector (i.e., points, lines, polygons) and raster (i.e., gridded) datasets. This includes spatial data acquired from field measurements using Global Positioning System (GPS), airborne / spaceborne remote sensing, and other mapping techniques. Data is primarily analyzed using the professional standard in GIS software - ArcGIS. However, instruction will be conducted such that skills can be readily extended to other GIS platforms. Furthermore, quantitative analyses in ArcGIS will be coordinated with analyses using other quantitative software (e.g., Matlab). Instruction will assume no prior experience using these specialized software packages.
