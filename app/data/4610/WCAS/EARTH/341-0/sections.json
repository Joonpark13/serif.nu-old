[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Studies of Quaternary climate (e.g., climate of the past 2.6 million years) have provided unique perspectives on Earth's climate system, for example illuminating the role that greenhouse gases play in climate change.  The Quaternary ice ages also shaped the landscape of Illinois and Evanston.  This course will cover methods for reconstructing and dating past environmental change, causes of natural climate change, major climatic events of the Quaternary up to present-day, and their relevance for understanding current climate change.", "name": "Quarternary Climate Change: Ice Ages to the Age of Oil", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "341-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/EARTH/341-0/23255", "instructor": ["Yarrow Larue Axford"], "id": "23255", "subject": "EARTH"}]
