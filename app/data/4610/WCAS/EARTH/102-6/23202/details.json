It represents a massive global experiment with unknown consequences. In this course we will discuss the scientific evidence for modern-day global warming including melting ice sheets, long-term temperature records from ice cores and extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Current trends and the role of human activities will be examined in the context of the geologic record of natural climate variability and the feedbacks inherent in the climate system. Anticipated future impacts include droughts, floods, spread of infectious diseases, drinking water shortages, habitat loss and extinctions. Given these forecasts, strategies for managing the effects of global warming will be assessed."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Writing assignments, class participation, oral presentation"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "value": "We will read books and articles about climate change that will range from in style from science journalism to books by scientists.
