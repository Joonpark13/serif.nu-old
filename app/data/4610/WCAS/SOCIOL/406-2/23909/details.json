It includes selections that illustrate how various thinkers have conceived of what it means to &quot;be modern&quot; or &quot;post-modern,&quot; critiques of modernity that have profoundly shaped our images of it, and skeptics who challenge the idea of modernity. It also includes sections that investigate in detail what I call &quot;mechanisms&quot; of modernity: procedures, devices, approaches or strategies that people adopt or promulgate in their efforts to be rational, manage uncertainty and conflict, or attain efficiency in various institutional arenas.
