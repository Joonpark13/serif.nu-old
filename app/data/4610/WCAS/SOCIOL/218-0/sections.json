[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an examination of social inequality in education, including its causes and consequences.  The course will focus on the case study of Chicago Public Schools (CPS), a diverse school system in a major urban area.  Building on existing sociological theories and concepts regarding educational stratification, as a class we will look at the influences of social inequality and diversity on the practice of education within CPS, including how educational outcomes vary across social student populations.  We will also explore the historical development of CPS and the current state of social inequality and diversity within CPS.  Social inequality takes on many forms and we will examine the interplay among multiple social statuses including gender, socioeconomic status, immigrant status, and race/ethnicity and explore how inequality impacts the experiences of the diverse student body present within CPS.  Finally, we look at current efforts aimed at improving local Chicago public schools and the efficacy of these reform initiatives.", "name": "Education and Inequality: Focus on Chicago", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "218-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/SOCIOL/218-0/27404", "instructor": ["Karrie A Snyder"], "id": "27404", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
