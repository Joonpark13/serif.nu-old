[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Social scientists have long been interested in the way that culture - the realm of shared beliefs, values, meanings, styles, and practices - intersects with social class. For example, early life exposure to cultural goods associated with the elite classes is thought to influence education and occupational outcomes later in life.  This course considers the profound intersection between social class and culture, with a special emphasis on gender and sexuality. We will explore the way that socioeconomic status intersects with gender norms, and how sexual communities and practices reflect social class patterns.", "name": "Class and Culture", "section": "20", "topic": "Focus on Gender and Sexuality", "course": "345-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/SOCIOL/345-0/23881", "instructor": ["Christine Virginia Wood"], "id": "23881", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
