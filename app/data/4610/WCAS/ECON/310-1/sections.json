[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Picking up where ECON 202 left off, this course uses mathematical models to analyze the behavior of optimizing (but constrained!) consumers and producers in market economies, thereby providing insights regarding the fundamental inner workings of markets. We will also use equilibrium analysis and comparative statics to understand markets characterized by competition, monopoly or monopsony. ECON 310-1 is a course primarily for economics majors and minors, so it will emphasize the development and application of economic theory.", "name": "Microeconomics", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "310-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ECON/310-1/21213", "instructor": ["Ronald Ray   Braeutigam", "James Andrew Hornsten"], "id": "21213", "subject": "ECON"}]
