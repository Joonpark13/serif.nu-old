[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "During the two quarters, students will be expected to write a substantial and original research paper. Most weeks students will meet individually or in small groups with Prof. Witte to discuss progress on their research. Occasionally the class will meet as a whole during regular scheduled hours. The emphasis of the course will be on work done independently by students on topics of their choice in consultation with their advisers, the TA for the class, and Prof. Witte. Ideally, a thesis topic (and adviser) will be found before the start of winter quarter.", "name": "Senior Seminar", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "398-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ECON/398-1/21249", "instructor": ["Mark P Witte"], "id": "21249", "subject": "ECON"}]
