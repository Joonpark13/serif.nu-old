The focus of the course is on microeconomic issues relating to markets, firms and households in developing countries. We will ask such questions as &quot;Why do the poor borrow at higher interest rates than the rich?&quot;, &quot;Do the poor under-invest in education and health?&quot;, and &quot;How can public policy be used to improve the well-being of people in developing countries?&quot; Topics include financial access, health and nutrition, education, insurance, migration and the role of institutions in development. We will also emphasize the interlinkages between the topics discussed in the course, for instance: How does investment in health depend on access to savings and credit? Does the presence of informal insurance affect how government education policies should be evaluated? Do the consequences of improved migration opportunities depend on how well credit markets function?<br/> <br/>We will combine economic theory and empirical analysis using data from developing countries to investigate these questions."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Econ 281, 310-1 and 310-2, or permission of instructor."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Two lectures a week."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Grading will be based on 4 assignments, 5 short reading responses, a midterm, a final exam and class participation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Debraj Ray (1998).
