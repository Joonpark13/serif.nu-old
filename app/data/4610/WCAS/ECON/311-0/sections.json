[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The macroeconomy is the most complex system ever studied by humans.  This course develops several models that explain long and short run behavior of the macroeconomy and its subparts.  These include output, interest and inflation rates, labor and financial markets, government and international balance.<br/>Students will be expected to understand how the interaction of the goods market and the money/asset markets can lead to possible multiple equilibria in macroeconomics, how the economy can get stuck in bad ones, and how fiscal and monetary policies may make matters better...or worse.  <br/>Students will understand the measurement of price level changes, labor market variables, productivity, and the macroeconomic imbalances that can exist with the government budget and for assets and trade flows between nations in world markets.  Students will understand the monetary and financial systems and how they contributed to our current situation, both in the US and Europe.  Students will also understand the determinants of long run economic growth, and the resulting implications.", "name": "Macroeconomics", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "311-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ECON/311-0/21229", "instructor": ["Mark P Witte"], "id": "21229", "subject": "ECON"}]
