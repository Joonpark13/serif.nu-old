[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Between the polar extremes of monopoly and perfect competition lies the realm of imperfect competition, often inhabited by a small number of interdependent firms with varying degrees of market power. Industrial economics (or industrial organization) explores the wide range of possible market structures and the competitive and cooperative strategies employed by profit-maximizing firms when there are few sellers, entry barriers, differentiated products, or imperfect information. We will review and expand the building blocks of the theory of the firm (cost and demand functions) and analyze the conduct and performance of monopolies, particularly through a variety of pricing schemes. We will use game theory to study oligopolistic firm behavior in a variety of scenarios, ranging from simple forms of static competition (e.g., Bertrand, Cournot and Hotelling models) to complex dynamic games involving strategic behavior (e.g., committing to an entry deterrence strategy or deciding whether to join a cartel). Although the problem we solve are mostly theoretical, we will discuss many real world applications.", "name": "Industrial Economics", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "349-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ECON/349-0/21243", "instructor": ["James Andrew Hornsten"], "id": "21243", "subject": "ECON"}]
