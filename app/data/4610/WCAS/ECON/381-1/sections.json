[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is the first course in the upper level econometrics sequence.  The goal of this course is to introduce the student to the theory and practice of econometrics on technically advances level and lay the foundations for ECON 381-2. The course will start with an in-depth treatment of the cross-sectional, linear regression model (using linear algebra). We will emphasize causal inference and examine when the linear regression model fails to deliver estimates with a causal interpretation. We will follow this discussion by introducing instrumental variable estimation as a means of obtaining causal estimates. We will then introduce panel data and discuss panel data estimation. Finally, the course will make use of the non-linear estimation method of  maximum likelihood when we discuss limited dependent variable models.", "name": "Econometrics", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "381-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ECON/381-1/21246", "instructor": ["Steffen   Habermalz"], "id": "21246", "subject": "ECON"}]
