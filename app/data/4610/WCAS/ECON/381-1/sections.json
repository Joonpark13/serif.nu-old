The goal of this course is to introduce the student to the theory and practice of econometrics on technically advances level and lay the foundations for ECON 381-2. The course will start with an in-depth treatment of the cross-sectional, linear regression model (using linear algebra). We will emphasize causal inference and examine when the linear regression model fails to deliver estimates with a causal interpretation. We will follow this discussion by introducing instrumental variable estimation as a means of obtaining causal estimates. We will then introduce panel data and discuss panel data estimation.
