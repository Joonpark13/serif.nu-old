It aims at answering questions such as:  by how much does a 5% price increase reduce the demand for a good?  This course is about how to use data and modern software to build, evaluate, and use models to answer such questions.  The course is taught in a computerized classroom.  Each student sits at a computer terminal, which enables us to estimate and diagnose models in class.  The course emphasizes the actual building of models.    Each student will write a paper describing the analysis of a real data set and the conclusions reached from that analysis.", "name": "Applied Econometrics", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute MG51", "topic": "", "course": "383-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/ECON/383-0/21272", "instructor": ["Joel L Horowitz"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "21272", "subject": "ECON"}]
