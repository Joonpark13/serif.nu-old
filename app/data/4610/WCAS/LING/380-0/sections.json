[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is focused on fluency and comprehensibility in conversation in both informal and academic settings. It is designed to help students develop and refine their English conversation, discussion, and discourse skills. While some attention will be given to American English intonation, word stress, and pronunciation, the primary purpose of this class is to explore functions of American English important for fluency in conversational speech. This will help improve your performance on tasks and activities involving spoken English, such as oral proficiency exams, presentations, teaching, and day-to-day social interactions.", "name": "Spoken English for Non-Native Speakers", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G28", "topic": "Culture and Fluency", "course": "380-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 5:00PM - 6:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/LING/380-0/23582", "instructor": ["Julia Margaret Moore", "Jennifer Alexandra Alexander"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "23582", "subject": "LING"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The primary goal of this course is to improve students' ability to effectively communicate in American English both inside and outside of the classroom.
