[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The Language of Bollywood<br/><br/>Have you ever wondered if people of all backgrounds speak Hindi-Urdu the same way, or if the language varies from place to place, class to class, person to person? If so, what determines this variation? What is the effect of the speaker's social and economic context on their language, and inversely, what and how does language tell us about somebody's background? What other variations are there in Hindi-Urdu? What role does time play in all of this? <br/><br/>In this course we will look at half a dozen or so Bollywood movies from various decades, with the stories set in different socio-economic circumstances. We will watch selected scenes and analyze the language used to se what it reveals about the movie characters.<br/><br/>You will be evaluated on your mastery of new pertinent vocabulary, on your ability to do verbal analyses and discussions in the Hindi-Urdu language, as well as your ability to write longer responses in Hindi-Urdu via home assignments and 2 Midterms. As a final assignment, you will be required to write a movie plot, and a dialog in Hindi-Urdu, i.e. you will have to demonstrate the ability to produce appropriate indirect and direct speech (about 5 pages).", "name": "Hindi-Urdu III: Topics in Intermediate Hindi-Urdu", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "211-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 2:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HIND_URD/211-1/22899", "instructor": ["Rami   Nair", "Fnu   Timsal Masud"], "id": "22899", "subject": "HIND_URD"}]
