Science, &quot;scientia,&quot; was the word for knowledge in the broadest sense?all subjects of inquiry. Poets wrote scientific treatises, Chaucer was known as a master of alchemy as well as the &quot;fadir of Englyshe poesie&quot; and figures we think of today as hard-core scientists, like Johannes Kepler, were practitioners of the creative arts, writing science fiction as well as scientific treatises. <br/><br/>What would it be like to revive this older paradigm, to reintegrate these supposedly disparate ways of thinking about thinking into a single classroom? Can the varied intellectual explorations of Thought from neuroscientific, literary, and artistic perspectives be harnessed and brought to bear on core issues that interest those seeking scholarly understanding of the human experience?namely, perception, memory, emotions, ethics, knowledge and madness? In this class, we will read literary texts, including Shakespeare's &quot;Hamlet,&quot; Jane Austen's &quot;Sense and Sensibility,&quot; and William Faulkner's &quot;The Sound and the Fury,&quot; as well as writings by neuroscientists, including chapters from David Linden's &quot;The Accidental Mind&quot; and Antonio Damasio's &quot;The Feeling of What Happens&quot; and short scientific articles on animal behavior, to explore different perspectives on what constitutes thought; what free will is and isn't; and what tools we have for making sense of feelings, logic, perception, and memory.<br/><br/>HUM 370-5/ENG 385/NEUROSCI 385 may count as either an Area V (Ethics and Values) or Area VI (Lit &amp; Fine Arts) distribution requirement.
