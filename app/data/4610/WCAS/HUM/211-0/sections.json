[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Genocide and Renewal: Native Peoples of the Americas<br/><br/>In this class, we will use Native American history to explore some big questions: What is genocide, and did one happen in the Americas in 1492 and thereafter? What enduring truths can be found in the landscape of the Americas, and what are the scholarly methods that can help us learn to read them? How do myth, literature, and art help a people recover from devastating trauma, violence, and loss? What does it mean to be an American today, and how is that identity shaped by Native Americans, past and present?", "name": "Humanities in the World II", "section": "20", "topic": "Genocide and Renewal: Native Peoples of the Americ", "course": "211-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/HUM/211-0/23407", "instructor": ["Mary J Weismantel", "Laura Monica Leon Llerena", "Forrest T Hylton"], "id": "23407", "subject": "HUM"}]
