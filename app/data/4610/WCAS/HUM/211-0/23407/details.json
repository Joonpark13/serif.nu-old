What enduring truths can be found in the landscape of the Americas, and what are the scholarly methods that can help us learn to read them? How do myth, literature, and art help a people recover from devastating trauma, violence, and loss? What does it mean to be an American today, and how is that identity shaped by Native Americans, past and present?"}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:49 PM (CT)", "subject": "HUM"}]
