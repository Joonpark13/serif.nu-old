At any given moment, how many alternatives are possible? Is there really such a thing as chance or choice? On what basis do we choose? How does our understanding of the past affect the future? Can we predict the future? Professor Gary Saul Morson, a specialist in literature, and Professor Morton Schapiro, a labor economist specializing in the economics of higher education, will themselves offer alternative approaches to these questions based on the presuppositions of their respective disciplines."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "In order to register for this class, please review last year's syllabus on Canvas (https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/13333/assignments/syllabus) and compose a 150-word essay answering either:<br/>1) what have you learned so far in your studies that will help you in this course? <br/>-or-<br/>2) what do you expect to learn in this course that will help you with your studies? <br/><br/>Send your essay attached as a PDF by December 9, 2015 (*new deadline*) to OfficeofthePresident@northwestern.edu, with &quot;Hum260 Admission 2016&quot; as the subject line.
