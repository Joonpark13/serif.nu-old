You will build upon this foundation for the remainder of the course by researching two asylum claims involving refugees from two countries, which you will present in mock hearings at the end of the course. The class will divide into two groups. Group 1 will present a claim involving their client and Group 2 will serve as the USCIS trial attorney or opposing counsel. Group 2 will then present a claim involving their client with Group 1 serving as the USCIS trial attorney or opposing counsel. <br/><br/>Throughout the course, you will be given assignments that relate to the presentation of your cases. You also will be given opportunities to discuss questions emerging from your research for your cases with guest speakers who are experts in specific areas relating to refugees or asylum law. It is anticipated that in the seventh week of class, we will meet with a judge and prosecutor to learn more about their professions and to give you an opportunity to ask questions relating to case procedure. In the eighth and ninth weeks of the quarter, you will represent your applicant's claim in front of a judge, with your classmates performing the roles of asylum applicant, and expert and lay witnesses, including family and community members (if relevant)."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "For more information contact the professor directly."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:50 PM (CT)", "subject": "LEGAL_ST"}]
