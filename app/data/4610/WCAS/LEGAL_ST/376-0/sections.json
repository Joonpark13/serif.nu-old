This course will explore the origins of the concept, and read selected political and legal theorists reflecting on the relation between the form and content of law and the use of violence and civil penalties to maintain order, develop a national or religious identity, and instantiate individual rights in modernity. The course will focus on the jurisprudence of statutory interpretation, with special attention to U.S. laws that constrain government authority. We will read current laws, regulations, and court opinions as well as texts by Max Weber, Hans Kelsen, Walter Benjamin, Carl Schmitt, Franz Kafka, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault.", "name": "Topics in Legal Studies", "section": "20", "location": "Scott Hall 212", "topic": "", "course": "376-0", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/LEGAL_ST/376-0/27971", "instructor": ["Jacqueline   Stevens"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27971", "subject": "LEGAL_ST"}]
