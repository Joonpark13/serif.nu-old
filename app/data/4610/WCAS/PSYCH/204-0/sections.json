[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course provides a broad overview of social psychology revolving around one general question: In what ways do our social relations affect who we are and how we act? In approaching this question, we will examine three basic social motives, \"Belonging\", \"Understanding\", and \"Controlling\", and explore how these motives influence how we explain our own and others' behaviors, how we form and change our attitudes and opinions, how we are influenced by the groups to which we belong, and what compels us to help or hurt those with whom we interact. At the end of the course, we will then discuss some ways in which the answers to these questions are relevant for addressing a variety of social problems.", "name": "Social Psychology", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G21", "topic": "", "course": "204-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/PSYCH/204-0/20925", "instructor": ["Daniel C Molden"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "20925", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
