Many education articles and popular press writings describe school gardens as a panacea to the nature-deficit disorder (Louv, 2005; 2011), an outdoor science lab (Bouillion &amp; Gomez, 2001; Williams &amp; Dixon, 2013), a source of nutrition, and a catalyst to better food choices (McAleese &amp; Rankin, 2007). In cognitive science there are studies on children's concepts of biology (Ware &amp; Gelman, 2014) and living things (Unsworth et al. 2012). There is potential for a fruitful (pun intended!) connection between these two literatures and discovering how to bridge this gap in the literature will be the point of this course."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites: Psychology 205 and 218"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "The grades will be based on posting weekly discussion questions, class presentations, and a final term paper."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "No required textbook; the class will read journal articles."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:52 PM (CT)", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
