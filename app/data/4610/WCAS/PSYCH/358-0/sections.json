Many education articles and popular press writings describe school gardens as a panacea to the nature-deficit disorder (Louv, 2005; 2011), an outdoor science lab (Bouillion &amp; Gomez, 2001; Williams &amp; Dixon, 2013), a source of nutrition, and a catalyst to better food choices (McAleese &amp; Rankin, 2007). In cognitive science there are studies on children's concepts of biology (Ware &amp; Gelman, 2014) and living things (Unsworth et al. 2012). There is potential for a fruitful (pun intended!) connection between these two literatures and discovering how to bridge this gap in the literature will be the point of this course.", "name": "Advanced Seminar in Cognition or Neuroscience", "section": "21", "topic": "Conceptual Change and Learning in School Gardens", "course": "358-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/PSYCH/358-0/21025", "instructor": ["Susan J Hespos"], "id": "21025", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
