How many times have you watched presenters ignore these limits, producing an information 'fire hose' effect where their audience understands and retains far too little? This class will survey techniques for avoiding this problem in your presentations, by understanding why and where our cognitive and perceptual limitations arise. We will focus on harnessing the power of a processing system that occupies over 40% of your viewer's brain - their visual system. We will explore visual presentation strategies that keep an audience's attention engaged, and a speaker's message understood and remembered."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Course grading will be based on discussion board postings, occasional quizzes on readings, a class presentation and other projects, and your critiques of other student work."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Required textbook TBA."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:52 PM (CT)", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
