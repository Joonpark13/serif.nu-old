[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The focus of this course is the development of perception, cognition, language, personality, and social interaction from infancy through adolescence. The course considers perspectives and methods in developmental research. As each new topic is introduced, students are encouraged to think critically about the assumptions and methods that underlie the research. A central goal is to help students develop an appreciation of different criteria for evaluating research and other forms of evidence. The discussion sections will allow students to consider how the theoretical and research findings are relevant to more applied issues.", "name": "Developmental Psychology", "section": "20", "location": "Swift Hall 107", "topic": "", "course": "218-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/PSYCH/218-0/20931", "instructor": ["Susan J Hespos"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "20931", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
