[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will consider developments in French and Francophone cinema since the Second World War, with a particular emphasis on the works of directors associated or in dialogue with the &quot;New Wave.&quot;  We will examine the reinvention of cinematic form by these filmmakers, but we will also explore how such formal innovations may be understood as attempts to respond to the historical events and social processes that transformed French culture in that period, most notably the traumas of the Second World War, the emergence of consumer culture, and the processes of decolonization and globalization.  Among the directors whose works will be discussed are Robert Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Tati, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Alain Resnais, Chris Marker, Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne and Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty.", "name": "French Film", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "375-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/FRENCH/375-0/23291", "instructor": ["Scott P Durham"], "id": "23291", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
