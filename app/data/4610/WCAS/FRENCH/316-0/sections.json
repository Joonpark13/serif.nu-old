The goal is to understand how these events fundamentally destabilized French national identity and the presumed universality of French/Western civilization, while raising new and difficult questions about the problem of freedom, the significance of human action, the legitimacy of violence, and the possibilities for lasting revolutionary change. Beginning with works from the 1950s that interrogate issues of responsibility, guilt, and complicity in relation to postwar histories of violence, we will move on to more explicitly polemical texts that problematized French colonialism and anticipated its downfall. We conclude with two novels and a film that interrogate the ambiguities and disillusionment of the postcolonial moment in Francophone Africa, thus laying bare some ethical, cultural, and sociopolitical contradictions that persist in the world in which we live today. Throughout the course we will supplement our reading of primary sources with historical essays about the events and transformations in question. Primary authors may include Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Ferdinand Oyono, Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, Frantz Fanon, Ahmadou Kourouma, Marguerite Duras, and Assia Djebar.
