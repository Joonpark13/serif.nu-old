[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course constitutes the second in a three part, year-long, introduction to the ancient Greek language, designed to provide students with the training required to begin reading unaltered ancient texts by the end of the year. Once this course is completed students will be able to progress to courses on such topics as the New Testament, Plato, Homer, the Greek tragedians, and many more. This course, then, builds on the fundamentals of Greek grammar and vocabulary mastered in the previous term and moves students into the study of more sophisticated constructions and increasingly unaltered Greek.", "name": "Elementary Greek", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "101-2", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeTh 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/GREEK/101-2/25291", "instructor": ["Ryan Christopher Platte"], "id": "25291", "subject": "GREEK"}]
