[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Anton Chekhov was born into a family of former serfs, worked his way through medical school while supporting his parents and siblings, and became one of the most admired story-tellers in the modern world. He represents a profound departure from his Russian context and pioneered modernist literary form, yet his work is also rooted in the culture of late imperial Russia. This course introduces significant elements of Chekhov's biography and his Russian context, and follows the trajectory of his development, from the early short stories to mature prose.  No previous background in Russian literature or Chekhov is required.", "name": "Chekhov", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "314-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 12:00PM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/SLAVIC/314-0/26910", "instructor": ["Susan McReynolds   Oddo"], "id": "26910", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
