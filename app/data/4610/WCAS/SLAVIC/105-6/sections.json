[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course provides an introduction to the prose fiction of Anton Chekhov. No previous background in Russian literature or Chekhov is required. We will trace Chekhov's development as a writer, from his early, very short stories written to subsidize his family and medical training, to the longer works of his mature period, when he was an internationally acclaimed artist. We will pay special attention to the way his stories reflect on the process of story telling itself, identifying questions about communication, the power to shape reality and perception, and authenticity as central to Chekhov's work. Some background in narratology will be provided to aid our analyses. We will also read select texts and passages from the Russian tradition (Tolstoy and Bunin) to foreground Chekhov's dialogue with cultural models and highlight the unique qualities of his art.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "1", "topic": "Chekhov &amp; Art of Story Telling", "course": "105-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/SLAVIC/105-6/26905", "instructor": ["Susan McReynolds   Oddo"], "id": "26905", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
