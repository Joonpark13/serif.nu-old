The city's magnificent streets and buildings both conceal and reveal a past full of multiethnic coexistence and interethnic conflict. The course aims to understand the development of Prague over the past two centuries from a multicultural, democratic city to a homogeneous, communist one, and ultimately to its present open and capitalist incarnation. <br/>We will read a range of literary and historical sources, including the story of the Golem and writings by Milan Kundera, V\u00e1clav Havel, and Franz Kafka.
