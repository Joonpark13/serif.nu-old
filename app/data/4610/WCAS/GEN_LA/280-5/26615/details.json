This course will offer a balanced approach to the growth and change in literature devoted to the subject of the environment, touching briefly on 19th century foundations (the assigned writers in the reader discussing Muir, Ruskin, Emerson, Thoreau) and moving quickly to the explosion of what may be a genre of literature unto its own. We will consider contributions from poetry, drama, fiction, and nonfiction, documentary, advocacy journalism, polemic. We will consider science and philosophy, art and religion, history and politics, all in the way they come to this huge and pressing subject. In order to further focus a very rich area of literature and art, we will focus especially on the idea of &quot;Living in Nature&quot;: why we want to, what it means, and what are the consequences. We will consider specifically Into the Wild (Krakauer), Derzu the Trapper (Arseniev), Thoreau's Walden, Giono's The Man who Planted Trees, Janet Kauffman's Rot, Junichiro Tanizaki's In Praise of Shadows, and Werner Herzog's documentary &quot;Grizzly Man&quot;. We will take time to discuss, under this subtopic, hunting and literature (with works by Edward Abbey, Joy Williams, James Swan, and possibly Ted Nugent)."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "<ul><br/><li>Through the topic of environment, we will invite considerations of literature through the lenses of science and art; of economics, psychology/biology, history, anthropology, religion, public policy and sociology. </li><br/><li>Through lecture, discussion, short and long papers, and student presentations, this multidisciplinary course will provide both a survey and a focus on learning how to perform a close reading of poetry and prose. </li><br/><li>Because I am a lecturer in the English Major in Writing, there will be an emphasis on good writing, and improving student writing. </li><br/><li>Continue to examine the emerging literature on the environment, and the new environmental criticism movement. </li><br/><li>Students will be taken for a field trip to the vertical farm called &quot;The Plant&quot;, situated near the location of Lewis's The Jungle. </li><br/></ul>"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Class format lecture/discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "One presentation, two short papers (2-3 pages with prompts assigned in class, and one long final term paper, 7-10 pages in length.
