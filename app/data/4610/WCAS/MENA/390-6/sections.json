The second part of the survey begins with the Mongol invasions into the Middle East during the 13th century, and points to the changes that occurred in Islamic art as a result of the artists' acquaintance with East and Central Asian art and culture.", "name": "Advanced Topics in Middle East &amp; North African Studies", "section": "20", "topic": "Islamic Art: 650-1600", "course": "390-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/MENA/390-6/23665", "instructor": ["Bilha   Moor"], "id": "23665", "subject": "MENA"}]
