We will look at how photography became a medium of visual expression in the culture of Latin America; questions of the construction of a shared Latin American identity; and how different kinds of photographs (journalistic, ethnographic, territorial survey, artistic) work as cultural interpretive tools. We will also learn how to speak and write critically about photographs, learn who major photographers were and how their images were produced and have circulated. We will put emphasis on the study of photographic themes that are singular to the Latin American experience: colonialism, revolution, native society, modernization, violence and oppression, politics and self-determination."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
