The \"walking dead\" phenomenon is not just a North American fad; zombies have appeared in literature and films in countries as diverse as Cuba, Norway, and India. Despite their current popularity, zombies have actually been around for some time, although their story has changed significantly. This course will explore the history of the zombie and its insertion into pop culture. We will explore the zombie's origins as a figure of Haitian folklore, and its introduction to English-language audiences through North American involvement in the Caribbean region. We will watch some of the earliest Hollywood zombie films, which make use of the zombie's Haitian origins, and we will read some examples of early pulp fictions that include zombies. The second half of the course will look at the re-configuration of the zombie story through the films of George Romero, and the films and parodies that have followed. We will end by examining the current globalization of the zombie figure and its transnational transformations. As we trace the zombie's history in popular culture, we will explore the figure's connections to slavery, colonialism, environmentalism, and consumerism.
