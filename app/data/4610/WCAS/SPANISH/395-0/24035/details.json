We will investigate manifestations of this connection from different moments in Latin American history, with a focus on the present moment. We will also examine the border city as the site of complex symbolic and literal crossings. Through a corpus that includes fictional and theoretical texts, films, videos, music, cartoons, and the visual arts, we will reflect on the variations, components, and implications of this urban, violent projection."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: 1 course from 250, 251, 260, or 261."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
