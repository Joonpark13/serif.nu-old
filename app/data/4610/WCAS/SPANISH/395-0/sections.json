Beginning with a critical definition of the genre (and the ways in which it differs from \"magical realism\" and the fantastic), we will examine some early examples of science fiction in Spanish language literature, read some now-classic texts that can be considered science fiction, trace the shift from science fiction to cyberpunk, and end by looking at the ways in which recent Latin American and Latina/o writers and directors have expanded on and experimented with the genre.  As we read, we will explore how science fiction navigates the divide between \"popular\" and \"elite\" literature, its function as a form of social criticism, and the ways in which writers have used science fiction to interrogate social categories such as race, class, and gender.
