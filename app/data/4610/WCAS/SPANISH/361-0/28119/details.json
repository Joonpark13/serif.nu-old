We will focus on literature, visual culture, and music, with attention to the ways in which these cultural manifestations' circulation and political and social affiliations inflect their outlook on what it means to be modern. As such, this seminar will give special consideration to the roles that race, class, gender, regional identity, and autochthony play in the articulation of modernity in the Andes."}], "lmod": "1/9/16 6:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
