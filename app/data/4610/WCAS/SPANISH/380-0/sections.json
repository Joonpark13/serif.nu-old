[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course we examine the work of some of the most original film directors in Spain from the neorrealista movement of the 1950's and 1960's to contemporary filmmakers such as Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar, Cesc Gay,  and Isabel Coixet. We will pay special attention to the surrealist films of Luis Bu\u00f1uel, the melodrama comedies and dramas by Pedro Almod\u00f3var, and the magical imagination of Julio Medem, among others. We will also discuss some of the films made by the new generation of directoras (such as Ic\u00edar Bolla\u00edn, Mar Coll) and young film makers (Jaume Balaguer\u00f3, Juan Antonio Bayona. We will analyze the narrative and visual structure of the films, as well as their relation to main political and cultural issues in Catalan and Spanish societies.", "name": "Topics in Film: The Silver Screen in Latin America and/or Spain", "section": "1", "topic": "Introduction to Spanish and Catalan Films", "course": "380-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4610/WCAS/SPANISH/380-0/24034", "instructor": ["Elisa   Marti-Lopez"], "id": "24034", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
