Trends towards empowerment, digitization, and globalization have resulted in organizations that routinely structure work around teams. Teams connect diverse, distributed individuals, empowering them to work collaboratively. Those working in, leading, and studying teams have repeatedly observed that teams can accomplish more than the sum or member capabilities (i.e., synergy), but often accomplish less than would the same individuals working alone (i.e., process loss). This course will explore the forces that affect behavior in teams, and the factors that lead to team success. This is an introductory course, with no prerequisites. We will cover a variety of readings, cases, activities, and class discussions to build concrete skills related to collaborative leadership and decision making.
