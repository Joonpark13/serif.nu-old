The course will review scholarship on the science of networks in communication, computer science, economics, engineering, organizational science, life sciences, physical sciences, political science, psychology, and sociology, in order to take an in-depth look at theories, methods, and tools to examine the structure and dynamics of networks. The majority of class time will be spent discussing the assigned readings. Laboratory exercises will provide experience with network analysis, modeling and visualization tools, and a term paper is expected advancing some theoretical, methodological, or computational aspect of network science.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Seminar-Problems in Comm Studies", "title": "SoC COMM_ST 525-0-21 Seminar-Problems in Comm Studies", "lmod": "5/1/17 9:05 AM (CT)", "section": "21", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Noshir   Contractor", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "Social Network Analysis", "course": "525-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students.", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This seminar is intended to review theoretical, conceptual, and analytic issues associated with network perspectives on communicating and organizing.
