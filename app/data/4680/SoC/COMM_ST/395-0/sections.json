Previously, organizational communication stood alone, and other separate organizational fields, such as public relations and marketing existed in a silo. In all of these areas, communication was studied separately and exclusively within limited contexts. Today, strategic communication has evolved due to our use of technology. The way we currently interact has changed how organizations are viewed, studied, and operated within; organizations have become boundary-less. In this course, we will examine organizational theories, processes, and practices that maintain and further strategic communication. A main focus will be the identification, examination, and assessment of stakeholders, both internal and external. Students will also explore organizational change and the practices that help to innovate, as well as challenges involved with management. We will start the course by gaining knowledge about strategic communication, and then we will start to apply it through real-world cases. At the end of this course, students will be able to understand, interact, assess, and communicate effectively within a variety of organizations by using strategic communication methods.
