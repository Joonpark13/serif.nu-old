Psycholinguistic, neurolinguistic, and cognitive neuropsychological research focused on understanding the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting lexical-semantic and syntactic processes will be discussed. The relevance of lexical-semantic and syntactic theories, models and data to understanding both developmental and acquired language disorders is emphasized.
