We analyze the theatrical innovations of several twentieth-century directors, including Stanislavski, Richards, Kazan, Appia, Craig, Meyerhold, Brecht, Schumann, Littlewood, Boal, Brook, Wilson, Taymor, Mnouchkine, and Kaufman. In each case, we consider the director in historical and artistic context, analyze the individual director's view of the theatre, and, when applicable, investigate how theatrical theory was applied in specific productions. Students will engage in focused research projects on directors of their choice, experiment with reconstruction, and approach the study of theatre history from the point of view of performance analysis.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Seminar-Studies in Theatre", "title": "SoC THEATRE 546-0-21 Seminar-Studies in Theatre", "lmod": "5/1/17 7:34 PM (CT)", "section": "21", "topic": "History and Theory of Directing", "course": "546-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Registration open to MFA Directing &amp; Design Students Only.<br/>Add Consent: Instructor Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This class examines the role of the director in the theatre from historical, aesthetic, and practical points of view.
