What are the technologies of memory that mediate gendered experiences of histories of wars in Asia? How have embodied Asian American cultural expressions served as a site to counter the familial, cultural, and historical amnesia that surround traumas of war? How do the competing uses of memory help us to understand contemporary cultural politics and national belonging?
