What role does the media play in that crisis? This course will investigate the ways in which environments, both natural and human, have been shaped by media representations and technologies. It will cover a variety of media forms and examine the role played by media in shaping our perception of the environment and fostering environmental advocacy movements. We will consider topics such as theories of media ecology; definitions of the \"Anthropocene\" epoch; the materiality of media infrastructure; media's role in raising environmental consciousness and promoting environmental justice; the history of wildlife documentary; eco-critical aesthetics; environmental history; representations of landscape and soundscape; and animals as media performers. We will assess media from diverse perspectives and consider a range of methodologies and critical frameworks. We will discuss numerous genres of environmental media, including apocalypse and disaster narratives, eco-comedies, toxic discourse, environmental melodrama, and sound art.<br/> <br/>Readings for the course will include texts by Donna Haraway, Ursula Heise, Nicole Starosielski, Lisa Parks, Richard Maxwell and Toby Miller, Kate Soper, William Cronon, Derek Bouse, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Rob Nixon, Nadia Bozak, Stacy Alaimo, Anna Tsing, Lawrence Buell, Alenda Chang, and others.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Research Seminar", "title": "SoC RTVF 584-0-20 Research Seminar", "lmod": "5/1/17 7:31 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "Media and the Environment", "course": "584-0", "enrl_requirement": "<br/>Add Consent: Department Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Most would agree that we are living in an era of environmental crisis.
