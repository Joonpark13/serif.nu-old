They should leave class with an understanding of several strategies to draw inspiration from, and specific ways to develop those strategies. They should also be adept at thinking visually and creating iconic images for their ideas, storyboarding these ideas, and disseminating these ideas into a compact, one-page format that gets to the essence of what they are trying to do.
