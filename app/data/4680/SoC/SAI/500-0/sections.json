Sound Studies draws on social, cultural and historical approaches to auditory experience, bringing together research that analyzes sound as a creative practice, a powerful form of cultural expression, and as a sensory mode integral to our lives. Students take this course at the same time as the production course SAI 501. As a result, students are prompted to simultaneously learn how sound works and how sound means, an interplay that is unique to our program. Students will be introduced to a range of sound-based industries and learn how they work together. Key works of sound art and design will demonstrate the aesthetics sound, for example, the expressive ways in which sounds are combined with images in media culture, and how mediated sounds facilitate new encounters with the lived environment. Students will gain an understanding of how sound mediates identity and provides a medium for cultural expression in various industries. Considerations of the history of auditory work will be used to indicate future trends in sound and to understand how listening has changed in the era of digital media.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Introduction to Sound Studies", "title": "SoC SAI 500-0-20 Introduction to Sound Studies", "lmod": "5/1/17 7:31 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "500-0", "enrl_requirement": "<br/>Add Consent: Department Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course offers a grounding in Sound Studies designed for sound professionals.
