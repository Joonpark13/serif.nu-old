However, as movements such as Black Lives Matter demonstrate, social media have not displaced but complement street protest and bodily expression. In this course we will explore uses of performance and social media as tools for activism. We will analyze practices of hacktivism and social media mobilization to understand ways in which activists employ body-based performance and technology to galvanize local and global audiences.

The goal of the course is to develop a historical and theoretical understanding of tactical media efficacy and to develop activist performances. The course will alternate between lecture, discussion, and hands-on exercises.
