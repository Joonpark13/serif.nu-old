Physics is the most basic of the sciences, dealing with the behavior and structure of matter. Lectures and labs illustrate physical principles: mechanics, motion, momentum and energy, and fluids. Continues in winter and spring quarters as PHYSICS 130-B, C. Requires concurrent enrollment in the PHYSICS 131-A lab. Lab times are Tuesdays 8-9:50 pm; Wednesdays 9-10:50 am; Saturdays 12-1:50 pm; or Saturdays 2-3:50 pm. Labs will meet for the first time after the first lecture session. Actual demonstrations of many physical principles will be shown in the lecture when ever possible. Weekly homework assignments emphasize problem solving. <br/><br/>Topics:<br/>1. Motion in One Dimension<br/>2. Vectors<br/>3. Motion in a Plane<br/>4. Particle Dynamics<br/>5. Work and Energy<br/>6. Conservation of Energy<br/>7. Conservation of Linear Momentum<br/>8. Collisions<br/>9. Rotational Kinematics<br/>10. Rotational Dynamics and Conservation of Angular Momentum<br/>11. Oscillations<br/>12. Fluids<br/><br/>Laboratory Exercises:<br/>1. Kinematics I: Uniform Acceleration. The study of an object sliding down a frictionless incline.<br/>2. Kinematics II: Acceleration-deceleration. The study of the interrelation between displacement, velocity, and acceleration for an object with changing acceleration.<br/>3. Newton's 2nd Law. Study of the relationship of mass and acceleration<br/>4. Conservation of Energy. Study of the transformation of energy from one form to another.<br/>5. Conservation of Momentum. Conservation of momentum and energy is verified for an elastic collision.<br/>6. Conservation of Momentum in 2-D. Conservation of momentum and energy is verified for an elastic collision in a plane.<br/>7. Rotation of a Rigid Body around a Fixed Axis I. Study of the relationship between torque, force, and moment of inertia.<br/>8. The Pendulum. The simple pendulum and the physical pendulum are compared.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "College Physics I", "title": "SCS PHYSICS 130-A-66 College Physics I", "lmod": "9/12/17 6:56 PM (CT)", "section": "66", "topic": "", "course": "130-A", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This is the first quarter of a three-quarter algebra-based physics course with lecture and laboratory.
