For many people, the Free Speech Movement at Cal with its famous campus disruption is the basic model of student protest. Over the next few years, protests on behalf of civil rights and against the war in Vietnam broke out across the campuses of America (including Northwestern). Fast-forward to 2016 and the issue of free speech at Cal has transformed to one in which the university is dealing with protesters who wish to disallow speakers from speaking?a dispute that is not unique to the Berkeley campus (this has also happened at Northwestern). This course will cover the trajectory of student protests that of a political nature, from the Free Speech Movement to the present day. There will be two major ideas informing our discussions: what is the purpose of the university? And, how central is free speech to the academic process? Both of these ideas were front and center at Berkeley in 1964 and should be front and center today. We will look at primary sources as well as commentary. Readings will be based on the pedagogical principle of \"teach the conflict,\" so that more than one side will be presented, analyzed, and considered. Case studies from the present time will be \"drawn from the headlines,\" and it will be students' responsibility to read across points of view and come to their own conclusions. We will consider issues such as free speech for Ann Coulter, the BDS movement, allowing representatives from the U.S. Military or ICE to speak on campuses, etc.<br/><br/>This course is also listed as POLI SCI 390 Topics in Political Science in CAESAR.
