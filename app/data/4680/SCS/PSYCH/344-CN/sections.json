Do all these people, across all these diverse cultures, think in the same ways? This course reviews research suggesting the answer is a resounding \"no.\" We will consider evidence that people around the world have different concepts of space, time, numbers, nature, and more; that people in the \"West\" and \"East\" process information differently; and that there is a cognitive divide separating people in small-scale traditional cultures from people in globalized ones. We will also examine how cultural tools?from ancient ones like writing and abacus to recent tools like GPS and Google?have shaped and continue to re-shape human cognition. Students will develop research projects on some aspect of how culture shapes psychology.
