We will explore two periods of U.S. history: 1890-1910 and 1960-1990. In each period we will examine the forces that impoverished individuals and families, the issues raised in explanations of poverty, the range of remedies proposed, and the ways they were justified. In both periods we will try to determine how Americans answered some lasting questions: How is poverty defined? Who among the poor deserves what kind of help? Does helping the poor promote dependence? What are the implications of poverty for the health of the nation as a whole?<br/>The primary purpose of the course is to give students experience in some of the techniques employed by historians: close and critical reading of documents; reconstruction of the thinking of past actors and evaluation of their assumptions, motives, and options; and the production of clear, fair, and inclusive analyses of what happened.
