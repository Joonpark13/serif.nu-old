First, we will examine how and why the colonies developed their laws and legal institutions, and how these evolved over time. Next, we will explore the legal, political, and social forces that led to the American Revolution, and we will look at how Americans drew on their legal experiences in drafting a constitution. We will then examine how judicial and legislative action guided and enabled explosive economic growth in the nineteenth century. Not everyone was able to participate in the new economy, however; we will explore how the law created separate categories for women, American Indians, and African Americans that limited their participation in law, politics, and society. By the end of this course, you should be able to: read, understand, and analyze different kinds of legal texts; understand a variety of legal concepts and doctrines and their meaning in historical context; understand the distinct roles played by different actors (judges, legislatures, lawyers, litigants, voters, etc.) within the constitutional system; and make cogent, evidence-based arguments about these core themes in law and legal history.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Legal and Constitutional History of the United States: Colonial Period to 1850", "title": "WCAS HISTORY 318-1-1 Legal and Constitutional History of the United States: Colonial Period to 1850", "lmod": "5/2/17 7:54 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "associated_classes": [{"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Fr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Fr 3:00PM - 3:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Fr 4:00PM - 4:50PM"}], "topic": "", "course": "318-1", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course explores some of the major questions and problems of American legal history from the colonial era to 1850.
