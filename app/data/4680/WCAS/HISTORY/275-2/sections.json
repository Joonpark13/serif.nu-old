But change has worked in the opposite direction as well: social priorities and political agendas have shaped the development of scientific knowledge and medical practice. This class invites students in the sciences and the humanities to explore the dynamic relationship between science, medicine, and our broader society. From global telecommunications to the atom bomb, and from Darwin to genomics, the emergence of modern science has been intimately tied to technological development, shifting political structures, changing conceptions of racial and sexual difference, and even our definitions of life and illness. While the geographic focus of the course will be on Europe and the United States, we will consistently explore the relationship between modern sciences and the increasingly global nature of commerce and politics since the nineteenth century. The guiding premise throughout this course is that science is an intrinsically human activity and hence an integral part of our modern world.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "History of Western Science and Medicine: In Modern Europe and America", "title": "WCAS HISTORY 275-2-1 History of Western Science and Medicine: In Modern Europe and America", "lmod": "5/1/17 8:12 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/467-2670", "instructor_name": "Daniel A Stolz", "instructor_addr": "Harris Hall - Room 235"}], "associated_classes": [{"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Th 3:00PM - 3:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Th 4:00PM - 4:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Th 5:00PM - 5:50PM"}], "topic": "", "course": "275-2", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Scientific change has profoundly reshaped human life in the past 200 years, transforming both the material world in which we live and our knowledge of how that world works.
