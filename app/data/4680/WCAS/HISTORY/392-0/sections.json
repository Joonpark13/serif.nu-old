Thus, Israel was established as a Jewish state but not exclusively so. The Palestinian Arabs who became Israeli citizens remained nationally and religiously bound to the outside Arab world. This necessarily resulted in a sharp crisis of loyalties, the Arab community being torn between its Israeli citizenship and its Arab national identity. Today the Arab minority constitutes nearly 20 percent of Israel's population. It has undergone intensive processes of change, generally referred to as: Israelization, Palestinization and Islamization.
