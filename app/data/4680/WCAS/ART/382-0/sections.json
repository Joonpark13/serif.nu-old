His work is foundational in forming and popularizing the political relationship between image and text that marks printed-matter today. Working with themes of protest, activism, and the imagination, his body of work influenced the civil rights movement of the 1960's and the storied \"summer of love\" (San Francisco, 1967). <br/><br/>This studio/seminar course will be taught concurrently with the exhibition \"The Age of Aquarius\" at the Block Museum which is framed around Blake's influence on artists of his generation through the 1960's, and beyond. Students will engage with the exhibition as a means to consider text, posters and banners as ways of communicating activist concerns. In light of contemporary means of protest in art and in the public sphere, we will also consider ways of expressing ourselves through the body and examine the relationship between the history of printmaking as a tool for speaking on behalf of oppressed bodies and current means of protest. <br/><br/>The course will provide an introduction to a variety of traditional and non-traditional print techniques including: monoprinting, relief, silkscreen and photocopying.
