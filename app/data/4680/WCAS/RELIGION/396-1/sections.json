In this seminar, students are guided through the honors thesis writing process while engaging with seminar mates in a workshop environment. We explore pieces of exemplary expository writing, discuss approaches to working with primary sources, learn advanced research strategies, and become skilled at editing and revising. More broadly, this seminar teaches project management skills applicable to most any career path (applying to graduate school, searching for a job, writing a grant, completing a project assigned by one's employer, starting a business, etc.). We will learn how to schedule a large project, how to break it down into smaller steps, and then how to make steady progress toward completion. Life/work balance skills will also be discussed, and students will learn strategies for prioritizing. Students will be encouraged to think about their life goals as they head toward graduation and what sorts of steps they can take toward achieving those goals. Attendance and active workshop participation is required.
