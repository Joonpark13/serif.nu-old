Through careful examination of a variety of literature produced by these traditions, we will consider the ways in which Buddhists have understood human suffering, life after death, karma, merit, the nature of the world and human's place within it, and the path to enlightenment. Our emphasis will be on attempting to understand the moral values, philosophical insights, ritual practices, and social concerns that have shaped Buddhism over centuries of dynamic change in diverse cultural contexts. We will examine not only the history of Buddhism and its three-fold division into Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana, but also facets of the contemporary practice of Buddhism with a focus on the place of mindfulness in America. In addition to textbook readings, course readings privilege primary source readings in order to introduce students directly to the narrative, doctrinal, liturgical, and biographical texts that inform our knowledge of what it has meant to live a Buddhist life over time and across cultures. \u00a0<br/>\u00a0", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Introduction to Buddhism", "title": "WCAS RELIGION 210-0-20 Introduction to Buddhism", "lmod": "5/9/17 7:38 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "associated_classes": [{"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Th 1:00PM - 1:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Th 1:00PM - 1:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Th 2:00PM - 2:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Th 2:00PM - 2:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Th 3:00PM - 3:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Th 4:00PM - 4:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Fr 9:00AM - 9:50AM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Fr 11:00AM - 11:50AM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "Fr 12:00PM - 12:50PM"}], "topic": "", "course": "210-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Religion, Asian Languages and Cultures, Middle East and North African Studies, International Studies, or Jewish Studies majors or minors", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course provides an introduction to key aspects of the Buddhist religious traditions of multiple Asian countries and the United States.
