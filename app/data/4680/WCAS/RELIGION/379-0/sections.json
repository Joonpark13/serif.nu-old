We will examine the complex entanglements of religion with human life, law, politics, and public culture. Beginning with the US, we will study legal controversies over yoga in US public schools and the public display of cr\u00e8ches in public in light of the complex religious history of the United States. We will then turn to the question of who is a Jew legally in the United Kingdom, before moving further afield to reflect on a series of dilemmas involving the intersections of law, religion, and politics in other contexts. Topics will include legal, political and religious history; discrimination and identity; religion, race, indigeneity and empire; religion and the rule of law; and religion and the politics of national security. The course traverses disciplinary, geographic, and secular-religious boundaries, drawing on readings from politics, socio-legal studies, religious studies, indigenous studies, anthropology, history, and popular culture. Students will also consider their own experiences of living with religious diversity, exploring tools and strategies to think in new ways about the entanglements of religion, law and politics in the contemporary world.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Topics in Comparative Religion", "title": "WCAS RELIGION 379-0-21 Topics in Comparative Religion", "lmod": "5/9/17 7:38 PM (CT)", "section": "21", "topic": "Politics of Religious Diversit", "course": "379-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Registration Reserved for Relgious Studies, Jewish Studies, and Political Science Majors and Minors.", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course will consider the relationship between religion and modern law and governance.
