Using case studies of Buddhist art in India, Tibet, China, Japan and Southeast Asia, the course examines the intertwining of art and ritual, and the actions that take place integral to the processes of donation and devotion. We will look at the roles of monks who perform the rituals, the patrons who sponsor the art and rituals, the texts that describe them, and objects which depict them.
