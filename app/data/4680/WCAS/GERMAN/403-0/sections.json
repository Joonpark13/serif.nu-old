The seminar is divided into three parts. In the first, we will read some of the early works of both Benjamin and Derrida, with particular attention to the way in which each of them, in his own way, seeks to radicalize and transform phenomenology?in part, by questioning the status of the cognizing subject and, in part, by asking what it would mean for language and literature to supersede mathematics and perception as the primary focal points of phenomenological inquiry. In the second section of the seminar, we will concentrate on their respective reassessments of the concept of origin, first by examining the relevant passages in the \"Epistemo-Critical Preface\" to Benjamin`s Origin of the German Mourning Play and then by reading Derrida`s account of the \"trace\" in the opening section of Of Grammatology and his similarly programmatic essay \"Diff\u00e9rance.\" In the third section, we will turn toward Derrida's reception of Benjamin, as we read their texts in tandem: Benjamin`s \"Artwork in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility\" with the second chapter of Derrida`s Truth in Painting; Benjamin`s \"Task of the Translator\" with Derrida`s \"Des Tours de Babel\": and finally, Benjamin`s \"Toward the Critique of Violence-Force [Gewalt]\" with Derrida`s Force of Law.
