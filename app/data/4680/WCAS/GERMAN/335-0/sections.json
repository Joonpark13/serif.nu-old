We shall follow influential socio-historical changes from the influx of so-called guest workers in the 1950s up to the recent series of reforms in citizenship laws acknowledging the changing face of those claiming Germany as their Heimat (homeland). In this context we will examine fiction, autobiography, poetry, and political and theoretical writings by and about \"minority voices\" in Germany in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Questions we will explore include: What is the relationship between autobiographical writing and identity? What is a \"minority\" and how might we conceive of \"minority voices\" in terms of ethnicity, religious belief, gender, class, and community? What can our readings teach us about the role of \"minority literature\" in Germany?", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Minority Voices in Germany", "title": "WCAS GERMAN 335-0-20 Minority Voices in Germany", "lmod": "5/14/17 6:50 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "335-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Starting out from the question: \"What is German?\", we shall enquire into changing understandings of national identity in postwar Germany.
