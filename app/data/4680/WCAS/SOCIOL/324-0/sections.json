With its earliest development in the destructive<br/>fires of colonialism and transatlantic slavery, capitalism's very development depended not only upon<br/>technological advancement, but upon international trade and finance and both forced and voluntary labor<br/>migration across national borders. Yet, since World War II, we have seen a noteworthy transformation in<br/>the nature of global capitalism. The rise of multi-lateral trade agreements and increasing power of global<br/>institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary fund are just two examples. This course will<br/>examine what we traditionally refer to as \"globalization\" as a historical and multi-scalar phenomenon, one<br/>developing in the context of neoliberalism; i.e. the cocktail of deregulation, privatization, and austerity<br/>currently stressing social and political norms across the globe. Paying particular attention to the way debt<br/>and austerity are used to uphold the power relations established in the long and disparate colonial histories of Asia, Africa, and Latin/North America, students should come away from this course understanding global capitalism as something that has changed at various points in time rather than something that emerged over the latter half of the twentieth century.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Global Capitalism", "title": "WCAS SOCIOL 324-0-20 Global Capitalism", "lmod": "9/12/17 7:23 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "324-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "In many ways, capitalism has been global from the start.
