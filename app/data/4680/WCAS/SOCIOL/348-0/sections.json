This class will draw from sociology, political science, psychology, history and legal scholarship to situate the role of race in contemporary U.S. politics, policy and law. We will look at how race continues to structure life experiences, social outcomes, opinions and political affiliations. We will review and critique various conceptualizations of race and racism in the literature. Finally, we will investigate contemporary political and policy issues. For each issue we will ask, how does race function in politics and policy? And, how does the law shape or respond to race and racial difference? The class is designed to give students a deeper understanding of the relationship between race, inequality and the law. Students will learn to apply theories of race and racism to contemporary political and legal issues.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Race, Politics, and the Law", "title": "WCAS SOCIOL 348-0-20 Race, Politics, and the Law", "lmod": "5/14/17 6:57 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "348-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "How does U.S. society, politics and law construct the notion of \"race?\" How do social, political and legal forces produce outcomes differentiated by race?
