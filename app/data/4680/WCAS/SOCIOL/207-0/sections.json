Urban areas are dense settlements of diverse groups of people. Racial, gender, sexual, ethnic, cultural, economic, and political heterogeneity all require negotiation and sometimes lead to conflicts that play out in the streets and neighborhoods of major metropolises. Also, elite political and financial actors in cities have a heavy hand in shaping the direction of urban development and the allocation of resources. We will look at the role of both institutional actors and average city residents in affecting the following urban issues, among others: residential stratification by income and race, suburbanization, urban policy, gender, crime, immigration, and culture. The class is grounded in the study of U.S. cities, but world cities will be discussed to provide comparison and to highlight the importance of globalization.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Cities in Society", "title": "WCAS SOCIOL 207-0-20 Cities in Society", "lmod": "5/11/17 7:42 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "207-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "The purpose of this course is to present and examine some of the major issues in the study and development of cities and their surrounding areas.
