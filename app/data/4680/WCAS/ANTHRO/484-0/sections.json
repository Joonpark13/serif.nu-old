We will consider the ways in which culture and language shape law, and the ways in which law conditions and constrains culture and language. The legal anthropological texts we read pay close attention to spoken and written language. The linguistic anthropological readings take the courtroom and disputes as their objects of analysis. We will consider in cross-cultural perspective such matters as testimony, evidence, persuasion, performance, linguistic rights as human rights, and gender. Throughout, questions of power, agency, and inequality (especially around gender and race/ethnicity) animate our investigations. Course materials include ethnographies, theoretical works, and primary sources.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Seminar in Linguistic Anthropology", "title": "WCAS ANTHRO 484-0-1 Seminar in Linguistic Anthropology", "lmod": "9/12/17 7:01 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "484-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Graduate Students.", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This graduate seminar examines the intersection of language and law, taking legal institutions as important sites for the creation, negotiation, and reformulation of social and cultural norms and practices.
