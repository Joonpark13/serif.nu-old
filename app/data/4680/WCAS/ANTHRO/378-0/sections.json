Through both theoretical and ethnographic texts, the course considers legal institutions as important sites for the creation, negotiation, and reformulation of social and cultural norms and practices. We consider the ways in which culture and language shape law, and the ways in which law conditions and constrains culture and language. Throughout, our attention remains on individual actors interacting with legal systems and principles and people's expectations of the law. We examine in cross-cultural perspective such matters as evidence, persuasion, performance, and discourse on human rights, legal pluralism, indigenous populations, globalization, and gender. Throughout, questions of power, agency, and inequality (especially around gender and race/ethnicity) animate our investigations. Most of our readings concern Muslim societies or populations, so we will examine intersections between various interpretations of Islamic law and other legal traditions. The legal anthropological texts we read give close attention to spoken and/or written language. The linguistic anthropological readings take the courtroom and/or disputes as their object of analysis. Required reading list will be finalized and circulated to students closer to the start of classes.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Law and Culture", "title": "WCAS ANTHRO 378-0-1 Law and Culture", "lmod": "5/8/17 12:36 AM (CT)", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "378-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Anthropology majors and minors.<br/>Add Consent: Instructor Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Law and Culture is a seminar-style introduction to the anthropology of law as the intersection of law, culture, and language.
