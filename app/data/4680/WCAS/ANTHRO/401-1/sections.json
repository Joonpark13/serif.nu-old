Specific attention will be given to how biological anthropology articulates with the other sub-disciplines of anthropology. General principles from evolutionary biology will first be discussed, examining how they can be applied to look at human biological and behavioral variation. Alternative approaches for explaining human variation are then explored and considered within a historical context. Third, we will examine the material (i.e., fossil) evidence for human evolution, focusing on the interplay between biological and cultural/behavioral evolutionary trends. Finally, we will examine how several aspects of modern human variation (eg. growth, nutritional status, morbidity and mortality) are shaped by the interplay between genetic, ecological and socio-cultural factors. Throughout we will highlight the utility of the bio-cultural framework for explaining human diversity.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Logic of Inquiry in Anthropology  (Bio)", "title": "WCAS ANTHRO 401-1-1 Logic of Inquiry in Anthropology  (Bio)", "lmod": "5/1/17 7:45 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "401-1", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course will provide an overview of key theories and concepts in biological anthropology.
