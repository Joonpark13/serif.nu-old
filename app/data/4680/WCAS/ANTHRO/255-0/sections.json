However, as with all instances when one position gazes at another, the result is both accurate and inaccurate. In this class we will turn our gaze on contemporary Africa from a cultural anthropological perspective. Using the tools of anthropology we will visit several arenas critical to contemporary African cultures - music & dance, cinema, literature, sport, the body, technology, politics and development, among others. Through these various lenses we will attempt to better understand cultural choices and what we can say about Africa/ns from our perspective. That is, to recognize and value both internal and external views of the continent. Through these arenas and these perspectives we will better know issues of power, gender, hierarchy, spirituality, and economics. Will you arrive at an entirely accurate view of Africa and Africans? Never.
