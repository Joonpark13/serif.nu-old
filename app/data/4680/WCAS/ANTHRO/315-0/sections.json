This course will examine the diverse ways in which humans use cultural resources to cope with pain, illness, suffering and healing in diverse cultural contexts. In addition, we will analyze various kinds of medical practices as cultural systems, examining how disease, health, body, and mind are socially constructed, how these constructions articulate with human biology, and vice versa. The course will provide an introduction to the major theoretical frameworks that guide anthropological approaches to studying human health-related behavior. Theory will be combined with case studies from a number of societies, from India, Japan, Brazil, and Haiti to the U.S. and Canada, enabling students to identify similarities across seemingly disparate cultural systems, while at the same time demonstrating the ways in which American health behaviors and practices are socially embedded and culturally specific. The course will emphasize the overall social, political, and economic contexts in which health behavior and health systems are shaped, and within which they must be understood.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Medical Anthropology", "title": "WCAS ANTHRO 315-0-1 Medical Anthropology", "lmod": "5/1/17 7:45 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-7207", "instructor_name": "Rebecca A Seligman", "instructor_addr": "1810 Hinman Ave., Room #204, EV Campus"}], "topic": "", "course": "315-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "How do Anthropologists understand and investigate the social and cultural contexts of health and illness?
