The course will focus heavily on learning about relevant research methodology including eye tracking, motor assessment, psychophysiology, cognitive assessment, and neuroimaging (other modalities will be examined as time permits).

We will focus on MLM as it is used in behavioral and social science research, with examples from education and adult development. Specifically, we will discuss in detail two types of multilevel models: clustered-observation or organizational models (e.g., children nested within classrooms) and growth-curve models (e.g., estimation of change with measurements nested within people over months or years). If we have time, we can consider a third: daily experience models (e.g., daily or hourly measurements nested within people over days or weeks).
