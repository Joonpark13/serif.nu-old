The course features guest appearances by most of the faculty members in the Psychology Department. In the fall quarter, professors affiliated mainly with the Brain, Behavior, and Cognition area (BBC) and the Cognitive Psychology area will teach the class. In the winter, professors affiliated mainly with the Social Psychology area, the Clinical Psychology area, and the new Personality and Health (P & H) area will be featured. Across both quarters, Mark Beeman (Department Chair) will attend some classes to selfishly enjoy his colleagues' wisdom, and to occasionally facilitate discussion and provide continuity.<br/><br/>Most class periods are divided into 2 one-hour slots. Each slot features a topic and corresponding faculty member. For each class meeting, 2-4 readings will be assigned (1-2 per instructor, generally). Each reading is a journal article or book chapter selected to raise fundamental issues in the field while still being accessible. The readings will be provided electronically via Canvas. It is imperative that each student read the assigned articles or chapters before the class meeting when they are due.
