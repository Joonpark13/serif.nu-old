Taking an interdisciplinary approach, the course identifies the main actors, institutions, practices and forms of knowledge production characteristic of what we call \"global health\" today, and explores the environmental, social, political and economic factors that shape patterns and experiences of illness and healthcare across societies.

Students learn about the major players in international health-the multilateral and bilateral donor communities, Ministries of Health, UN agencies-and understand the key shifts in donor policies towards healthcare delivery as promulgated at Alma Ata, Mexico City, Cairo and Beijing.
