This discussion based course is designed to provide students with a historical overview of four subject areas pivotal to the field's consolidation: the unification of the globe by disease; the spread of biomedicine and allied disciplines around the world; the rise of institutions of transnational and global health governance; and the growth of the pharmaceutical industry. In order to place global health in its widest possible context, students will learn about the history of empires, industrialization, hot and cold wars, and transnational commerce. We will analyze the political and economic factors that have shaped human health; the ways in which bodies, minds, and reproduction have been medicalized; and the socio-cultural and intellectual struggles that have taken place at each juncture along the way. Above all, this course should give students tools to assess the benefits, dangers, and blind spots of existing global health programs and policies.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Biomedicine and World History", "title": "WCAS GBL_HLTH 309-0-1 Biomedicine and World History", "lmod": "5/4/17 7:24 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "309-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: No freshmen allowed.
