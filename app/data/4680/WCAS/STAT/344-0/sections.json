The students will learn how to use R language to realize various statistical analyses. In addition, they will learn how to use Linux clusters for their computing needs in research, and how to develop R packages that integrate subroutines from compiled language such as Fortran or C++ codes. In addition to the basic training of computing and programming, students will learn the theory and methods related to computational statistics for simulations and statistical inference as sketched in the following outline.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Statistical Computing", "title": "WCAS STAT 344-0-1 Statistical Computing", "lmod": "5/11/17 7:44 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "344-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course is intended to teach students in three main aspects of statistical computing including: computing platforms, statistical programming and computational statistics.
