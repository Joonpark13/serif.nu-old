Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods,and determine how they affect the scope of inference. 2. Use statistical software to summarizedata numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis. 3. Have a conceptual understandingof the unified nature of statistical inference. 4. Apply estimation and testing methods to analyzesingle variables or the relationship between two variables in order to understand naturalphenomena and make data-based decisions. 5. Model numerical response variables using asingle or multiple explanatory variables. 6. Interpret results correctly, effectively, and in contextwithout relying on statistical jargon. 7.
