Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods, and determine how they affect the scope of inference.<br/>2. Use statistical software to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis.<br/>3. Have a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference.<br/>4. Apply estimation and testing methods to analyze single variables or the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions.<br/>5. Model numerical response variables using a single or multiple explanatory variables.<br/>6. Interpret results correctly, effectively, and in context without relying on statistical jargon.<br/>7. Critique data-based claims and evaluate data-based decisions."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Students will be evaluated through (1) responses to requests for discussion/comment on topics through Canvas; (2) online homework; (3) quizzes/labs/activities; (4) a midterm and; (5) a final."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Custom Finite Math, 6th ed<br/>Waner and Constenoble<br/>ISBN: 978-1305044784<br/>Cengage Press"}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4680/WCAS/STAT/202-0/14202", "instructor": [""], "class_attributes": "Formal Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "14202", "subject": "STAT"}, {"class_mtg_info": [{"meet_t": "MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM", "meet_l": "Harris Hall 107"}], "school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Introduction to Statistics", "title": "WCAS STAT 202-0-21 Introduction to Statistics", "lmod": "5/1/17 10:09 AM (CT)", "section": "21", "topic": "", "course": "202-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of Class", "value": "Contact the department for further information"}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4680/WCAS/STAT/202-0/14203", "instructor": [""], "class_attributes": "Formal Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "14203", "subject": "STAT"}]
