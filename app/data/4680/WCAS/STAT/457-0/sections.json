Two types of methods are considered in detail: observed data and data augmentation methods. The observed data methods are applied directly to the likelihood or to the posterior density. These include: Newton- Raphson, Laplace's method, Monte Carlo and Metropolis methods. The data augmentation methods rely on an augmentation of the data which simplifies the likelihood or posterior density. These include: EM, Data Augmentation, Poor Man's Data Augmentation and the Gibbs sampler. All methods are motivated and illustrated with real examples.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Applied Bayesian Inference", "title": "WCAS STAT 457-0-1 Applied Bayesian Inference", "lmod": "5/11/17 7:44 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "457-0", "enrl_requirement": "<br/>Add Consent: Instructor Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to a variety of computational algorithms for Bayesian inference.
