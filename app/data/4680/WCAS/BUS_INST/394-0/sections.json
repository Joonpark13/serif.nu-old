Throughout this period, American business has seen a transformation in the way risk is evaluated, capital is raised, and organizations are led. The \"rules of the game\" during this period have changed radically in terms of corporate control, business management and wealth creation. We will explore the transformations in business and commerce during the past four decades that have led to current trends and problems.<br/><br/>Students interested in the recent history of Wall Street, financial markets, and business culture will enjoy this class. It will also appeal to students intrigued by late 20th and early 21st century American society - specifically how business and American industries have influenced America's identity. Those who may want to explore a career in business should find the seminar helpful in preparing for many types of professions across disciplines.<br/><br/>Students will be exposed to topics such as leveraged buyouts, junk bonds, venture capital investing, the \"Internet Bubble\", entrepreneurial management, hedge funds and derivatives. In addition, we will explore public policy trends around issues including corporate takeovers, technology transfers, risk management and business investment. A common theme throughout the quarter will be how capitalism has evolved over the past few decades, and how this has changed the mindset of business professionals and the American workforce. It will be up to you to determine if this evolution has been beneficial or detrimental to American society.<br/><br/>This will not be a seminar grounded in heavy technical economic and financial analysis or market theory. You will not need an academic background in economics to understand the topics of the class. No pre-requisites are necessary.<br/><br/>Because students are not expected to have previous knowledge of these topics, the reading list is significant. Students are expected to complete readings prior to class. Please refer to the reading list for primary texts that will be used for the class. There will also be supplemental readings, including articles and essays, that will be provided by the instructor.<br/><br/>As part of the class, we will have a series of guest panels and lectures by business professionals from Chicago, New York and San Francisco including investment bankers, corporate attorneys, business CEOs and private equity professionals.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Professional Linkage Seminar", "title": "WCAS BUS_INST 394-0-28 Professional Linkage Seminar", "lmod": "5/1/17 9:31 AM (CT)", "section": "28", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Matthew C Levin", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "394-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Juniors &amp; Seniors", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This class will explore the history of American business during the final two decades of the 20th century to the present.
