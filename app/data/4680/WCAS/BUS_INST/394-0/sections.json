The course is taught by a leader in the Chicagoland non-profit community and combines both a consulting experience with area non-profits facing organizational strategy issues with classroom lectures and discussions on the nonprofit sector. The class is composed of 25 students who are split into teams of five, and matched with local non-profit organizations and Kellogg MBA mentors, to work on quarter-long consulting engagements. Students directly engage with their client organizations in the field and then collectively meet once per week to discuss issues and problems they are facing with one another and their instructor, as well as to attend a series of classroom lectures on the nonprofit sector. To inform and guide students' interactions with non-profits, the classroom sessions will provide an overview of the non-profit sector and the growing trends towards greater accountability, transparency and performance management. Students will explore the changing roles and responsibilities of non-profits, as shaped by both the public and private sector, and they will examine the implications of these trends. The course curriculum has two parts: 1) introducing students to the so-called Third Sector and the present political and economic systems that influence how it serves the public good and 2) examining business strategy and management and their applicability to non-profits.
