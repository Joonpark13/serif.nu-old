His creative oeuvre opened new worlds because of his taste for literary and ethical adventures and nimble, luminous style. At the beginning of his career, Calvino resisted the appeal of literary realism and neorealism and invented an idiosyncratic new genre of whimsically comic science fiction in Cosmicomics. He also was a restless traveler, who wrote extensively about his journeys through the USA, Russia, Japan, etc., and eventually joined the international literary group known as Oulipo, whose members were vocal proponents of the notion of literature as a game. Starting in the 1970s, he became a firm believer in the promise of world literature, which resulted in Invisible Cities, Calvino's rewriting of Marco Polo's accounts of his travels through China. In his \"hypernovel,\" If on a Winter's Night a Traveler, Calvino created a sort of imaginary index of world literatures, playfully deploying globe-trotting characters who undertake a worldwide quest through a shifting landscape of literary genres. Finally, in his celebrated Charles Norton Lectures for Harvard University, Six Memos for the Next Millennium, he articulates for his readers the fundamental values of the world literatures that still are to come: lightness, quickness, exactitude, visibility, and multiplicity. In response, we may well ask: what is the geopolitical map on which Calvino's imaginary explorations unfold? To what extent do Calvino's writings create new possibilities for redefining the very concept of world literature?
