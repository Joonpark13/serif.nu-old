Students' work will be divided among class discussions and workshops, in- and out-of class labs, and individual and collaborative research. Students will meet with the instructor for two hours and a half every week in a traditional classroom setting where they will discuss assigned readings, do task-based exercises, report on the progress of their research, showcase their projects and receive feedback from the instructor and their classmates. Weekly labs will complement the regular sessions and will provide students with a dedicated time and space to familiarize themselves with digital technologies.
