What is genocide, and can Native American communities recover from such trauma and loss? What role might tradition, literature, and art play in healing? Can Indigenous and settler-colonial societies ever reconcile? What does it mean to be an \"American,\" and how have Native people, past and present, shaped that identity? To answer these questions, we will move from the ancient past to present-day political struggles. We will draw upon a variety of tools, ranging from archaeology to literature and law. Throughout the course, we will analyze persistent myths, reframe colonialism as a set of ongoing processes, account for differing outcomes, and reflect upon our interrelationships with the forces that have shaped nations and communities throughout North and South America, including here at Northwestern. Finally, our work will extend beyond the classroom, including field trips to the Art Institute of Chicago, the Newberry Library, and the American Indian Center of Chicago.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Humanities in the World I", "title": "WCAS HUM 210-0-20 Humanities in the World I", "lmod": "5/1/17 9:46 AM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-4822", "instructor_name": "Mary J Weismantel", "instructor_addr": "1812 Hinman Ave., Room #105, EV Campus"}, {"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Laura Monica Leon Llerena", "instructor_addr": ""}, {"instructor_phone": "847/467-4821", "instructor_name": "Douglas   Kiel", "instructor_addr": "Harris 229"}], "topic": "Genocide, Resistance, Resurgence: Native Peoples", "course": "210-0", "enrl_requirement": "<br/>Add Consent: Department Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Note: This course is only open to first-year students accepted into the Kaplan Humanities Scholars Program.<br/><br/>In this course, we will traverse the Americas to ask a series of big questions that resonate across national boundaries: What does it mean to be Indigenous?
