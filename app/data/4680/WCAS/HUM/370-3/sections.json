By the twentieth century, places like Hawai?i came to be idealized as a harmonious multicultural society. This class examines how race and indigeneity are constructed within the Pacific using an interdisciplinary approach. Drawing from works within indigenous studies, ethnic studies, and critical race studies, students will address themes of sovereignty, settler colonialism, diaspora, and migration in order to interrogate and problematize the concept of the multicultural ?melting pot' across time. We focus on the impacts of U.S. plantation economies, militarism, and tourism in shaping the triangulation of indigenous, Black, and Asian groups in Hawai?i and across the Pacific.<br/><br/>This course meets for the duration of the fall quarter, and includes a mandatory class trip to Honolulu, Hawai?i the week before fall classes begin.
