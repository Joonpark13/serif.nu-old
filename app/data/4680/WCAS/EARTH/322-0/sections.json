Students will also learn to work in a unix computing environment as well as basic visualization using Python's matplotlib and the Generic Mapping Tools. The material first centers around a set of diverse, accessible, and uncomplicated seismic data related to an earthquake, with later applications in other areas of the physical sciences. More advanced topics such as multithreading in Python, curve-fitting, and numerical solution of differential equations are introduced but not elaborated. Exercises will build familiarity and core strengths while final projects illustrate the computational research process from raw data or theory to somewhat polished \"research product\" and inspire development, critical thinking, creativity, persistence, and innovation. This course offers extensive self-paced tutorials, to engage students inside and outside the classroom. The tutorials are in the form of content-rich quizzes that we call quizorials. The quizorials are organized into modules, along with other resources, including a free reference book on Scientific Programming in Python. No prior programming experience is needed.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Scientific Computing in the Physical Sciences", "title": "WCAS EARTH 322-0-01 Scientific Computing in the Physical Sciences", "lmod": "5/11/17 7:23 PM (CT)", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "322-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Introduction to scientific computation in the physical sciences with an emphasis on data analysis and programming in Python.
