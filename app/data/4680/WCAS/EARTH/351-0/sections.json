Learn about the formation of planets and their evolution, with our solar system as the prime example.<br/>2. Learn about how the Earth's evolution has made it habitable, as compared with sister planets Mars and Venus. The prospect for life elsewehere in our solar system.<br/>3. Understand the origin and history of life on Earth, and the role of extinctions, also the critical role of plate tectonics in forming Earth's surface and in the evolution of the planet.<br/>4. Apply what we know and suspect about Earth to develop hypotheses about the conditions for habitable planets beyond the solar system.<br/>5.
