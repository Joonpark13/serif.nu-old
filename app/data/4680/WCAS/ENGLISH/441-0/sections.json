The classical concept of experience - best exemplified by Aristotle's dictum that good judgment requires experience - construed experience as a form of wisdom, acquired through habituation and narrative embedding. By contrast, empiricism (particularly in Locke) reconfigures experience so that it refers to disaggregated and punctually encountered sense data, shorn of the narrative and fictional structures in which those data acquire meaning. How does the novel respond to these changes? The narration of individual subjective experience has long been understood to be one of the signal contributions of the modern novel. But experience in what sense? Some novels deepen the sense of shock, disorientation and estrangement that comes with the modern conception of experience, while others attempt to reconstitute the sense of meaning and narrative coherence that characterized an older concept of experience. In this class, we will examine the history of the concept of experience and study philosophical accounts of experience, alongside readings of a range of eighteenth century novels, in order to better understand how the novel might come to serve as a privileged vehicle for mediating experience. How does experience become meaningful or purposive for an individual, rather than being encountered as mere data? In what ways are fictional structures, such as narrative and metaphor, essential to constituting that meaningfulness? How are judgments, founded on those fictional structures, integral to the constitution of meaning, rather than merely secondary and dispensable operations performed on already given data? In addition to examining novels in relation to philosophical accounts of experience, we will also read a broad selection of recent criticism that examines the relation between empiricism and the eighteenth-century novel.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "18Th Cent Lit", "title": "WCAS ENGLISH 441-0-20 18Th Cent Lit", "lmod": "5/11/17 7:26 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "Experience and Meaning in the Novel", "course": "441-0", "enrl_requirement": "<br/>Add Consent: Department Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course will explore how the concept of experience changes under the conditions of modernity, and particularly the ways in which the uniquely modern form of the novel either radicalizes or resists those changes.
