Our exploration will include examining the history of marketing literary texts, such as advertisements for Charles Dickens' serialized novels, as well as narratives concerning advertising or consumerism. Moreover, students will learn to analyze marketing campaigns, advertisements, and television commercials. What cultural assumptions - e.g., about gender, class, or race - can we discover by analyzing the rhetoric and imagery of specific advertisements or branding strategies? An overarching question in the course will be the relationship between high and low culture: when might advertising count as art, and does the popularity of a literary text detract from its aesthetic or literary value? How does the pervasiveness of advertising influence what a society desires or values? We will read broadly, from stories that are set in or satirize the world of advertising or explore themes of consumerism and marketing, to nonfiction texts that discuss or deconstruct advertising and consumer culture. Readings may include Walker Percy, The Moviegoer; Dorothy Sayers, Death and Advertising; Jerry Della Femina, From Those Wonderful Folks Who Gave You Pearl Harbor; short stories by Fritz Leiber, Emile Zola, Flannery O'Connor, and Virginia Woolf; and selections from Mark Twain, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court; David Ogilvy, Confessions of an Advertising Man; and Roland Barthes, Mythologies. From film and television, we will watch episodes of Mad Men; The Thrill of It All; and Killing Us Softly: Advertising's Image of Women.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Studies in Literature and Commerce", "title": "WCAS ENGLISH 387-0-20 Studies in Literature and Commerce", "lmod": "5/1/17 8:05 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "Mad Men: Rhetoric & Lit of Advertising", "course": "387-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "In this course, we will investigate literature about and the rhetorical conventions of branding, advertising, and commercialism.
