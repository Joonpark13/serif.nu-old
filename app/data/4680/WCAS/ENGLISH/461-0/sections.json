Set as perverse deviations or inverse reflections of straight-line trajectories from despotic ancestral pasts to free reproductive futures, the queer and the oriental are two species of wrong which frustrate sublation into the generalities of \"right\" or \"white.\" Too wrong for history, these two wrongs also cannot be rectified or reduced into each other?but not for lack of trying. Over the course of the long twentieth century, a seemingly endless pile-up of cultural productions have positioned Orientals as queer or featured queers Orientalizing themselves and others. The mind-gagging glut of such productions illustrates how thoroughly their maneuvers never really work; or rather, how they work, like desires often do, by never being done.<br/><br/>The first third of the seminar will open with an intensive review of two texts that are axiomatic for contemporary queer and post-colonial theory: Michel Foucault's History of Sexuality, Vol. 1 (1976) and Edward Said's Orientalism (1978). We will reinforce our readings of Said and Foucault with a crash course in philosophy of world history (via Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche). These readings will help us situate the uptake of \"genealogy\" as method in the work of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Partha Chatterjee, Lisa Lowe, Kuan-Hsing Chen, and Sara Ahmed. <br/> <br/>In the remaining two-thirds of the seminar, we will read queer, orientalist, and anti-orientalist literary and cinematic texts paired with appropriate critical readings based upon the group's intellectual needs and research interests. Prospective texts include: Natsume Soseki's Kokoro, E.M. Forster's Passage to India, Virginia Woolf's Orlando, Yoshiya Nobuko's Yellow Rose, Maxine Hong Kingston's China Men, Djuna Barnes' Nightwood, Marguerite Duras' The Lover, Samuel R. Delany's The Mad Man, and Nic Wong's Crevasse.<br/><br/>Since this is a fall quarter seminar, I will not require the production of an end-of-term research paper. (The option remains open for those seminar participants who wish to pursue it). The seminar will place more emphasis on reinforcing foundational skills of graduate-level knowledge production, such as close reading and reading for argumentative structure; preparation, construction, and analysis of field bibliographies or \"lists\"; and oral presentation, including prepared and extemporaneous delivery of questions and responses. In lieu of a final paper, the culminating elements of the seminar will be a conference paper or article proposal, a critical annotated bibliography, and a final interview/oral exam based upon the proposal, bibliography, and a comprehensive review of the readings of the seminar as a whole.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Studies in Contemporary Literature", "title": "WCAS ENGLISH 461-0-20 Studies in Contemporary Literature", "lmod": "5/9/17 7:23 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "The Queer and the Oriental", "course": "461-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: REASON: Pre-registration is not allowed for this class.
