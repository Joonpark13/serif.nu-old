We are the inheritors, perpetuators and innovators of literary culture, and in this class we will position our inquiries on the present and future, even as we acknowledge the enduring humanistic values of writing. We will begin with a discussion of ideas gleaned from readings by Virginia Woolf, Martha Nussbaum, Lewis Hyde, Adrienne Rich, Ta Nehisi Coates and others. Then we will build on these ideas practically with an interview with another writer; a service learning assignment; and a creative work that reaches a new public, coordinates new media or engenders community. Many of our Thursdays will be enhanced by the \"Return Engagements\" series, featuring visits and readings from alumni of Northwestern's Writing Program who have gone on to forge careers in the literary arts. We will read their writing and open time for you to talk with them about continued education, publishing, agenting and editing. This course is designed especially for students who hope to forge careers as writers, and it will challenge all participants to think creatively about the space of literature in our changing society.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "The Situation of Writing", "title": "WCAS ENGLISH 392-0-20 The Situation of Writing", "lmod": "5/8/17 1:57 AM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "392-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: REASON: Pre-registration is not allowed for this class.
