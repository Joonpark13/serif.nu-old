Some scholars have even argued that games are replacing novels and film as the dominant form of cultural expression. Others view games as a frivolous and unproductive activity, not worthy of serious study. In this seminar, we will explore some of the fundamental questions about the relationship between games and human culture. Why do people play games? What kinds of meanings, cultural values and political agendas do games encode? Do games function differently than other cultural objects, such as films, novels or works of art? What might it mean to think of all culture and works of art as arising from a \"play impulse\"? And if this is the case, why do we trivialize game-playing? Is the ubiquity of games in our lives a specifically modern phenomenon? Is the advent of the digital age producing a gamification of everyday life? To investigate these questions, we will read a wide range of critical writing about the importance of play and games in human culture, by philosophers, novelists, literary critics, social scientists, historians and game designers. The class will give you an opportunity to develop a 12-15 page research paper that studies one particular game or aspect of game culture in-depth. In the process, you will learn how to frame a significant research question; articulate a research proposal; navigate scholarly databases and archives; evaluate sources; and, produce an annotated bibliography.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Research Seminar for Literature Majors", "title": "WCAS ENGLISH 397-0-20 Research Seminar for Literature Majors", "lmod": "5/9/17 7:23 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "Cultures of Play", "course": "397-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Pre-registration - Reserved for English students.", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "From video games and board games to game shows and sports, games saturate our culture and shape who we are.
