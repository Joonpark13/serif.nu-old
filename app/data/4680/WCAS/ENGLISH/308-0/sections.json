Podcasting has filled the void left by the deadening of broadcast radio that began in the 1970s, and will likely soon surpass it (if it already hasn't) in variety, accessibility and beauty. Students will be invited to write and produce multiple radio essays, mini-docs, stories and poems, layering the spoken word with evocative sonic textures and music.
