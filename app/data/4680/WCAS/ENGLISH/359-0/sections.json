This is the classic and complex tale of a young woman of extraordinary talents thrust at the age of nineteen into a suffocating marriage. It is a brilliant portrait of the subtle, agonizing moral dilemmas at the heart of everyday life. In its rich social tapestry of scientific and political visionaries, of bankers and bohemians, farmers and lords, Eliot traces the complex tangle of ambition and frustration, of betrayal and compromise, and of spiritual awakening and deadening. We will read the novel slowly and carefully, probing the richness of its language, its philosophical meditations and its complex human psychology, and we will investigate its literary and historical context by reading scholarly essays on a host of fascinating background topics.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Studies in Victorian Literature", "title": "WCAS ENGLISH 359-0-20 Studies in Victorian Literature", "lmod": "5/9/17 7:22 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "359-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Pre-registration - Reserved for English students.", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course will be an intensive study of one of the most critically acclaimed novels ever written: George Eliot's Middlemarch.
