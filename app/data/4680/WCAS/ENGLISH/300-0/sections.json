His stories and essays anticipate the Freudian unconscious and various forms of psychoanalytic, poststructuralist, and modern critical theory. Poe wrote a spooky novel called The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym and several volumes of poetry and short stories. As editor or contributor to many popular nineteenth-century American magazines, he wrote sketches, reviews, essays, angelic dialogues, polemics, and hoaxes. This course will focus on Poe's writings as a means of learning how to read and analyze a variety of literary genres, including lyric and narrative poems, the novel, the short story, detective fiction, science fiction, the essay, the literary review, and critical theory. We will study poetic language, image, meter, and form as well as various story-telling techniques such as narrative point of view, plot, structure, language, character, repetition and recurrence, and implied audience. We will also study a variety of critical approaches to reading and interpreting Poe's writings, including formalist, psychoanalytic, historicist, Marxist, feminist, queer, critical race, poststructuralist, and postcolonial theory and criticism. We will conclude by looking at the ways Poe's works have been translated and adapted in a selection of contemporary films and other pop cultural forms.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Seminar in Reading and Interpretation", "title": "WCAS ENGLISH 300-0-20 Seminar in Reading and Interpretation", "lmod": "5/1/17 9:37 AM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Betsy J Erkkila", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "Reading & Interpreting E.A Poe", "course": "300-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Edgar Allan Poe invented the short story, the detective story, the science fiction story, and modern poetic theory.
