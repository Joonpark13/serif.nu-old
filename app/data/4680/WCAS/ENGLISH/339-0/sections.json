While some may dismiss such modern-day adaptations as cheap derivatives of Shakespeare's sacred originality, this course discovers that Shakespeare himself was a savvy purveyor of knockoffs. Very few of Shakespeare's works emerged originally from his lone creativity. Do you like Shakespeare's sonnets? Sir Philip Sidney beat him to it. Are you thrilled by the ghost of Hamlet's father? Thomas Kyd was writing vengeful ghosts before it was cool. Like modern adapters, Shakespeare was revising existing material both to innovate on past conventions and to address present cultural problems. In this class, we will follow the chain of adaptation that links Shakespeare's sources, Shakespeare himself, and his modern adapters. By tracing these strings of historical influence we will better understand the social imperatives that lead adapters to tweak, retain, or redact their source material.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Special Topics in Shakespeare", "title": "WCAS ENGLISH 339-0-20 Special Topics in Shakespeare", "lmod": "5/11/17 7:25 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "Adapt or Die, Perchance to Dream", "course": "339-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Shakespeare's works provide a rich source of material for modern adaptations like Akira Kurosawa's Ran, Disney's The Lion King, and even YouTube's Sassy Gay Friend.
