In this course, we will trace the origins and the evolution of detective stories in order to uncover the various roles that these popular figures have played in the representation of crime and its punishment. Turning our attention to a range of examples, including the traditional gentleman (Sherlock), the spunky teenager (Veronica Mars), and the real-life sleuth (the makers of Serial), we will interrogate the ways in which detectives have shaped our understanding of the law, the people who break it, and those who uphold it. What do we learn about society when we see it through detectives' eyes? How do the stories that detectives tell?about themselves or about the suspects they investigate?impact the way that we view crime? And in what ways do detectives aid or challenge the legal systems in which they operate?", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Studies in Fiction", "title": "WCAS ENGLISH 313-0-20 Studies in Fiction", "lmod": "5/1/17 8:05 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "Detective Stories", "course": "313-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "From London's fastidious Sherlock Holmes to Los Angeles's smooth-talking private eyes, detectives have developed into some of the most popular characters in British and American fiction alike.
