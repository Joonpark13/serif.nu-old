As an entry point into these conversations, this course will survey literature and film centering on the US-Mexico border. Students will become familiar with the history of the border, beginning with the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo in 1848 and extending through NAFTA and up to the current political climate. Together we will consider how the border has become such a potent site for contemporary mythmaking, a flashpoint for anxieties about race, labor, gender, and sexuality.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Studies in American Literature", "title": "WCAS ENGLISH 471-0-20 Studies in American Literature", "lmod": "5/2/17 7:49 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "Border Literature", "course": "471-0", "enrl_requirement": "<br/>Add Consent: Department Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "The US-Mexico border has been the site of intense cultural conflict since the mid-nineteenth century.
