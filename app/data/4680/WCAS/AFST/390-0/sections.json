In recent years, this number has stagnated and, by some accounts, declined. The aim of the course is to achieve a deeper understanding of these dynamics and their implications. It will be achieved by reading and discussing the works of leading scholars of these processes.<br/>The collapse of the Soviet Union led to several years of Western ideological hegemony. The spread of jihadist insurgencies, the 9/11 destruction of the World Trade Center, prolonged wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, and violent conflicts in many areas have affected global priorities. Nationalist authoritarianism in China and Russia, the rise and collapse of the \"Arab Spring\", mass migrations, and religious sectarianism have contributed to the apparent \"unraveling\" of democracy (Thomas Carothers, 2017). <br/>Two decades ago, Fareed Zakaria contended that \"half of the ?democratizing' countries in the world are illiberal democracies.\" Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Prime Minister of Hungary since 2010, has even championed \"illiberal democracy\". Carothers agrees that many \"newer democracies in the developing world are struggling to put down roots, and many older democracies?including the United States - are troubled.\" Another scholar, Christopher Walker, contends that the \"renewed global struggle between democracy and authoritarianism\" seems to trend in favor of the latter (2016). Is liberal democracy being eclipsed by new forms of authoritarianism? Is the liberal international order losing ground to an illiberal variant? Are more governments slipping into a \"gray zone\" of hybrid regimes that pick and choose among divergent norms and values? These are some of the urgent issues and developments to be probed.<br/>The upsurge of authoritarian \"populist\" nationalism in the West is evident in several countries. Political parties based on such movements are altering the composition of governments, including in \"Old Europe\". The Brexit vote in Britain, the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, the surge in support for once extremist positions in France, are just some of the developments that suggest the fracturing of the liberal democratic consensus. The victory of autocratic-leaning Aleksandar Vucic in Serbia in April 2017 reflected, according to one commentator, how \"political leaders?are feeling less pressure to govern within the confines of democratic institutions or to protect human rights, press freedom and the rule of law, and to fight corruption\" (New York Times, April 2017).<br/>Carothers contends, however, that these trends should be treated with caution. \"Although the state of democracy around the world is very troubled, it is not uniformly dire, especially outside the West.\" This course will also trace the declining commitment to democracy promotion.
