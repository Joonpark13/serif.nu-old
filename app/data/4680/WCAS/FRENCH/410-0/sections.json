For writers such as St. Augustine, the Occitan troubadours, Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, Dante Alighieri and the authors of the Roman de la Rose, writing is always an act of interpretation, one which confronts the essential indeterminacy of linguistic signs, both spoken and written. This anxiety reflects the unstable nature of medieval textual culture, as well as the fractured reality of spoken vernaculars dialects in contrast with the universal status of Latin as the language of literary and historical authority. In this class, we will study texts from a variety of genre (poetry, exegesis, romance) that interrogate the nature and function of language, from early medieval Biblical hermeneutics to the scholastic renaissance of the 12th century, the rise of vernacular literary cultures in the 13th and 14th century, and the textual revolution brought about by printing in the 15th century.
