While the writing of absence is a dominant political and historical theme in contemporary literatures of migration, exile, and war, we will frame the question much more broadly in order to attend to absence as a constitutive dimension of literary writing. In this sense, the writing of absence may also imply absence as writing. In order to begin thinking the possibilities that the relationship between these two elements suggest, we will make brief excursions into theoretical works that may help frame the question for us in a preliminary fashion. <br/><br/>A thinker who has suggestively elaborated the relationship between absence and writing in his own work is Maurice Blanchot. We will therefore begin the first segment of our course with selections from Blanchot's work so that we can glimpse some of the stakes of this mode of reading and questioning. We will then move to theoretical and literary works by writers from the African continent written in French and try to tease out the ways in which these diverse approaches to literary writing might think absence in relation to writing. <br/><br/>Given Blanchot's own mode of writing where the literary and the theoretical are often not distinguishable, we will not prioritize the theoretical over the literary. Rather we will read them in conversation with each other allowing them to interact by confirming and/or challenging each other's stakes. <br/><br/>This course is designed to accompany the Department of French and Italian's Fall Colloquium focused on Maurice Blanchot entitled \"Maurice Blanchot: Thought of Absence,\" which will take place on Friday November 3rd, 2017.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Studies in 20Th Century Literature", "title": "WCAS FRENCH 460-0-20 Studies in 20Th Century Literature", "lmod": "5/14/17 6:50 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "Writing Absences", "course": "460-0", "enrl_requirement": "<br/>Add Consent: Department Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course traces the writing of absence in select works of fiction by writers from various parts of Francophone Africa.
