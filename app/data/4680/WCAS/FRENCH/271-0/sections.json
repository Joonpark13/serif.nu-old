In our discussion of these texts, we focus on the representations of otherness - through the figure of the stranger or the outsider - and the role of difference, especially in terms of race/ethnicity, class, and gender, in shaping the French imaginaire and literary canon. In so doing, we study several major literary developments in the history of French-language literature, from the philosophical and epistolary novel in the 18th century, to Romanticism, Realism, and the Fantastic in the 19th century, and the roman beur and migrant Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois literature in the 20th century. We study how the differences between these texts relate to narrative and literary techniques on the one hand, and changing historical and cultural contexts on the other. The course privileges the analysis of style, form, language, and theme. We also develop the techniques of close reading and detailed critical analysis through class discussion and presentations, the creative/reflective assignment, the analytical essay, and the final examination.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Introducing the Novel", "title": "WCAS FRENCH 271-0-20 Introducing the Novel", "lmod": "9/12/17 7:10 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "271-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course will cover novels from the 18th to the 20th century through the study of five novels and novellas.
