Climate change novels ask: how might climate change transform the world in which we live? What will the world be like in the future, and what will it mean to the human beings who live in it? The alternative visions of the future elaborated in the works of climate change fiction often combine characteristics of science fiction with elements of other genres, including the romance, the thriller, and the adventure tale. In addition to inquiring into the literary issue of how and with what literary means these novels manage to imagine the future, we will seek to understand: if and how literature manages to imagine a process as widely taken to be \"unimaginable\" as is climate change, whether fiction might further human knowledge or awareness or if it might modify human actions in the world. We will engage in close and detailed reading and discussion of some of the most compelling contemporary Cli-Fi novels and in writing about them critically.
