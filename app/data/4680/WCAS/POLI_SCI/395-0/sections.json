The spread of jihadist insurgencies, the 9/11 destruction of the World Trade Center, prolonged wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, and violent conflicts in many areas have affected global priorities.

It will examine how the dysfunction, and \"failure to deliver\", of western democracies have contributed to the erosion of confidence among citizens in their own systems. <br/>Students will write a research paper on a country or region of their choice, apply these frameworks of analysis, and probe further the questions raised in the readings and in class.
