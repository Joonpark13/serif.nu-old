Following an introduction that defines \"materials\" and \"nanoscience\", the course covers specific synthetic strategies and methodologies. The first topic covered is polymerization chemistry, starting with basic principles followed by the most advanced methods known to synthesize polymers such as living free radical reactions, ring opening methathesis polymerization, recombinant DNA synthesis of polymers, and supramolecular noncovalent polymers. This is followed by topics in self-assembly of materials and nanostructures including liquid crystals, gels, self-assembly of amphiphiles, self-assembling monolayers, layer-by-layer assemblies, and colloidal crystals. The last third of the course covers chemical synthesis of ceramics, and synthesis of nanomaterials such as quantum dots, metal nanoparticles, graphene, and carbon nanotubes.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Materials and Nanochemistry", "title": "WCAS CHEM 307-0-01 Materials and Nanochemistry", "lmod": "5/11/17 7:22 PM (CT)", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "307-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course introduces first year graduate students and seniors in chemistry to the field of materials and nanotechnology focusing on synthetic methods to create materials and nanostructures with specific functions.
