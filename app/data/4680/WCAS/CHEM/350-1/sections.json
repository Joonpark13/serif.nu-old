As there will be carryover of topics from one quarter to the next, the 3 quarters of the course must be taken in the designated sequence. As there may be continuation of some experiments from one quarter to the next (i.e. a compound synthesized in one quarter may be analyzed in a subsequent quarter), the 3 quarters of the course should be taken in the same academic year. Any deviation from this will require permission of the instructors.<br/><br/>The full 3 quarters of this course will cover advanced topics in methods of:<br/> <br/>instrumental analysis<br/>synthesis of inorganic compounds<br/>synthesis of organic compounds<br/>spectroscopy<br/><br/>The course is designed for you to work in a \"research environment\". That is, a research project usually requires a variety of different experiments to reach the desired conclusion. This requires sufficient knowledge to use a variety of experimental techniques and to interpret their results. For example:<br/><br/>- A synthetic chemist must have enough knowledge of reaction mechanisms and synthetic techniques to be able to prepare a specific compound in a single, or more likely, multi-step procedure. Upon successful preparation of the compound, one must perform a variety of analyses to characterize the sample and confirm that the desired compound has been made.<br/><br/>- A physical or analytical chemist who wishes to study the kinetics of a reaction, the spectroscopy of a specific compound, or the use of an analytical technique for characterization of specific compounds often must have the ability to synthesize the compounds of interest.<br/><br/>In these courses you will learn and practice specific techniques for synthesis and chemical analysis. You will apply these techniques both to assigned problems and to a problem of your choice at the end of the three courses. <br/><br/>Chemistry 350-1: In the first half of this course you will study the advanced analytical techniques mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.
