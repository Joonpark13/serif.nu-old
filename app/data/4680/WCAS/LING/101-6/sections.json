Each student will select a topic of individual interest for a final research project. Topics might include (but are not limited to) the role of intonation in linguistic communication, voice and technology (e.g., telephones), voice in social media, voice and music, voice in professional roles, voice and gender, voice and age, voice disorders, the forensic use of \"voiceprints,\" voice in acting, voice in animal communication, human-machine vocal interaction, variations of voice across languages, accents and voice control in second language learning, the significance of voice in public speaking, and the representation of speech in literature.
