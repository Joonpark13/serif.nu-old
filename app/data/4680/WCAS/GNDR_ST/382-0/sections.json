As in many historical contexts, race and gender interacted dynamically and created the particular context of Nazi-occupied Europe, which was a place where Jewish men and women suffered in particular ways, German men and women participated in particular ways, and other racial groups - men and women alike - were targeted, collaborated, resisted and rescued. We will read a variety of texts that explore the influences that shaped the behavior and response of an array of people during the Holocaust. Racism sat directly in the center of the Nazi world view. Once the Nazis got into power, they sought to translate ideology into policy. Still, their racial policies evolved over time, spurred by opportunism, innovation, and war. And too, Jewish men and women responded in ways similar and divergent to the Nazi onslaught. Sexism was also seemingly an important aspect of the Nazi perspective.

Mondays will be devoted to background presentations and outlining crucial issues. The seminar style discussions on Wednesdays will be the heart of the class dedicated to sharing and analyzing readings, films, lectures and other materials such as photographs and paintings. Students will rotate responsibility for starting discussions as a team (each student volunteers twice over the quarter). Between 100 to 150 pp of reading a week. Three to four films viewed outside of class meetings. One short essay (5 pp) with an assigned topic. Two additional short essays (2 to 3 pp.) due after leading the discussion. One final paper (5 to 7 pp) due during exam week. Final essays may be either a short research paper or a book and/or articles review based on student interest and developed in consultation with instructor. Students enrolled under GSS 350 will write a research analysis paper based on a monograph or article on the reading list and write a research proposal (7 to 10 pp)."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Attendance and participation (30 percent); 3 short papers (50 percent), final essay (20 percent).
