It offers a broad overview of the social, cultural, political and economic factors shaping the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, and of the policy responses that the epidemic has generated in different settings. Specific topics include the shifting terrain and shape of the epidemic in different parts of the world (and perceptions of it); the factors influencing HIV vulnerability cross-culturally; and the ways in which governmental and non-governmental organizations have sought to respond to AIDS in a range of different country settings. In addition, we address international and multilateral responses to HIV/AIDS, using them as a case study that illuminates both the promises and perils of international response to health crises.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Gender, Sexuality, and Health", "title": "WCAS GNDR_ST 332-0-20 Gender, Sexuality, and Health", "lmod": "5/4/17 7:25 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "Anthropology of HIV/AIDS", "course": "332-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Gender Studies students.", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course examines HIV/AIDS from an anthropological perspective, looking critically at the history of anthropology's involvement with the AIDS crisis from the disease's discovery to the present day.

We will take up disability broadly, understood to include not just physical \"impairment,\" but also psychiatric difference and neuroatypicality, chronic illness, forms of substance use, pathologized affects, and other deviations from mental and bodily norms. Echoing basic arguments of gender and sexuality studies, scholars have long emphasized that disability be understood not as a natural or biological condition, but a social and political category constructed through institutions of medicine, law, and culture. Accordingly, activists and scholars have challenged medical models that conceptualize disability as an individual defect in need of elimination; they have also critiqued the idea that disability is strictly a minority experience or identity?to the contrary, it is a status that most humans will occupy at some point in their lives. In this class, we'll trace some of the intersections of issues of disability, gender, and sexuality, along with an eye towards work in related fields like ethnic studies, transgender studies, fat studies, and animal studies. Foci will include: the politics of health (understood not as a self-evident ideal but a social norm); historical and contemporary disability activism; issues of institutionalization, incarceration, and policing; theories of embodiment (including work in \"somatechnics\"); madness and mad studies; and work in the emergent field of crip theory.
