This is a lecture-based course combined with experimental demonstrations on the basic theory and phenomenology of superconductivity and its applications. Fundamentals include the electrical and magnetic properties of superconductors, Londons theory of the electromagnetic response of superconductors, Landau and Ginzburgs theory for the thermodynamics and magnetic properties of type I and type II superconductors, the origin of quantized magnetic flux, the Josephson effect, and the operation of Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) for high-precision magnetometry. Applications are wide ranging, from superconducting quantum electronics to superconducting radio-frequency cavities for particle accelerators.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Introduction to Superconductivity", "title": "WCAS PHYSICS 421-0-1 Introduction to Superconductivity", "lmod": "9/12/17 7:20 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "421-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course is an introduction to the phenomena of superconductivity, superconducting materials and their many applications in basic science and technology.
