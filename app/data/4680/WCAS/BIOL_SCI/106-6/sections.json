An overwhelming majority of people agree that we should work to save biodiversity, but their views are largely based on vague, positive feelings about nature rather than concrete justifications. This course investigates those concrete justifications. The first half of the course sketches out the argument for preserving biodiversity (i.e., \"thinking globally\"). The second half of the course focuses on the practice of ecological restoration in forest preserves a few miles from campus (i.e., \"acting locally\") not merely as a way to preserve biodiversity, but as a path to redefining a sustainable relationship between nature and culture. the readings for the course range from classics of environmental writing to recent research papers in the primary scientific literature. Biodiversity also needs to be experienced directly, so we will take a field trip to a local forest preserve where we will roll up our sleeves and help restore a native habitat and see how much biodiversity means to the people with whom we live and work.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "title": "WCAS BIOL_SCI 106-6-1 First-Year Seminar", "lmod": "5/11/17 7:17 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "topic": "Values of Biodiversity", "course": "106-6", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Freshmen and Sophomores<br/>Add Consent: Department Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "One of the major challenges of our changing world is the loss of biological diversity.
