Evolution occurs when mutation introduces new alleles that replace existing alleles in populations via one of two mechanisms. Replacement can occur by chance (genetic drift) or by encoding a superior phenotype (natural selection). Natural selection produces one of the major features of the living world, adaptation. We will examine several adaptations (life history, sex, cooperation) in depth. When populations are separated from one another geographically, they inevitably take different evolutionary paths; it is in this manner that most species are formed. These latter processes-change within lineages and diversification among lineages-have been iterated over staggeringly long periods of time, producing another major feature of the living world, its breathtaking biodiversity. We will familiarize ourselves with the history and diversity of life on earth by examination of the fossil record, and by inferring relationships among species using phylogenetic methods.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Evolutionary Processes", "title": "WCAS BIOL_SCI 342-0-20 Evolutionary Processes", "lmod": "5/8/17 12:56 AM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "342-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: REASON: Pre-registration is not allowed for this class.
