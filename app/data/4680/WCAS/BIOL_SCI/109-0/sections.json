We will learn about biological processes by studying how plants make and store food, reproduce, defend themselves, and colonize new areas. We will examine the interactions of plants with other groups of organisms, such as with pollinators and ant \"bodyguards\", and how plants play a fundamental role in the ecosystem. We will also discuss adaptations that plant groups have evolved for living in extreme environments, including deserts and mountain tops, as well as adaptations in carnivorous and parasitic plants.Through all of these topics, we will consider practical aspects of plant biology as we study how humans use plants, as sources of food, fiber, and medicines.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "The Nature of Plants", "title": "WCAS BIOL_SCI 109-0-1 The Nature of Plants", "lmod": "5/11/17 7:17 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "109-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course is designed to give students an understanding of the biology and ecology of plants while at the same time not overwhelming students with levels of detail and specialized terminology that are not useful to non-majors.
