First we cover basic principles of protein architecture. We then focus on the relationship between protein structure and function. Classes of proteins discussed in detail include enzymes, DNA binding proteins, membrane proteins, and nucleotide binding proteins. Methods for determining protein structures are also briefly covered. Finally, students will learn how to display and manipulate three dimensional macromolecular structures on the computer.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Protein Structure and Function", "title": "WCAS BIOL_SCI 361-0-20 Protein Structure and Function", "lmod": "5/8/17 12:57 AM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "361-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: REASON: Pre-registration is not allowed for this class.
