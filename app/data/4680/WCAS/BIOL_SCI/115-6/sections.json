Scientists examine evidence from the past, work to understand the present, and make predictions about the future. Integral to this process are the methods they use to collect and analyze data, as well as the ways in which scientists work together as a community to interpret evidence and draw conclusions. In this class, we will take a multidisciplinary approach to examining biological thought and action and their social ramifications. We will seek to understand science as a social pursuit: the work of human beings with individual, disciplinary, and cultural differences, and requiring tremendous investments in training and equipment. Does it matter that participation in science is more accessible to some than to others? How do biases, assumptions, uncertainty, and error manifest in scientific work? What is the history of scientific values such as objectivity and reproducibility? The course will conclude by investigating current topics of public debate, including stem cell research and global climate change.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "title": "WCAS BIOL_SCI 115-6-20 First-Year Seminar", "lmod": "5/4/17 7:13 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "Biological Thought and Action", "course": "115-6", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Freshmen<br/>Add Consent: Department Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Science is a process by which people make sense of the world.
