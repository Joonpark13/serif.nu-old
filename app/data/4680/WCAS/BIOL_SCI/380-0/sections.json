Students are expected to have a thorough understanding of molecular and cell biology before taking this class. Various mechanisms controlling cell proliferation, signal transduction, DNA damage repair, cell fate decisions and cell-cell communications will be discussed. Topics will also include nature/hallmarks of cancer and current strategies for cancer treatment. The goal of this course is to have a rich intellectual exchange of ideas while taking an in depth look at the molecular causes of cancer.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Biology of Cancer", "title": "WCAS BIOL_SCI 380-0-1 Biology of Cancer", "lmod": "5/11/17 7:18 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "380-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Prerequisite: Students must complete BIOL_SCI 315 or 390 to register for this course.", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course is focused on the molecular/cellular mechanism underlying cancer initiation and progression.
