We will study economic decisions that individuals and households face from a unique gender perspective. The topics we will cover include, among others: the status of women around the world, education, marriage, fertility, labor supply, household decision-making, and discrimination. The class will put an emphasis on applied microeconomic theory and empirical analysis. A combination of econometric techniques and theoretical models will feature prominently in the course. For each topic, we will study concrete examples emanating from all over the world, and make an intensive use of statistics and econometrics. We are also very much interested in understanding the relationship between research and public policy. By the end of the quarter you hopefully will have a solid microeconomic framework within which to analyze important issues in economics from a gender perspective.<br/><br/>There will be a series of empirical papers to read for this course. These papers will be discussed in lecture and they should be prepared prior to class. Preparing the paper means reading the abstract, introduction and conclusions (not necessarily the body of the paper) to understand:<br/>1. What is the paper's research question?<br/>2. What methodology is used to answer the question (e.g., an experiment, a quasi-experiment, a set of correlations, etc)?<br/>3. What are the main findings?<br/>4.

To do well in this class, you should be well acquainted with uni-variate and multi-variate calculus, statistics, and regression analysis: this class takes an approach to economics that is mathematical. You will also need a very good command of introductory micro since we will use and incorporate a lot of models from consumer behavior (I recommend you brush up your notes from 310-1)."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "The goal of this course is to give the student the ability to critically evaluate both the literature on gender issues and related policy debates, to identify where contributions to this literature can be made and to apply concepts learned through class assignments."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lectures and discussion sections.
