We begin by documenting the facts. To this end, we review existing evidence on the answers to the following questions: How important are fluctuations in the modern U.S.? Why were fluctuations larger in the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century? Who gains and who suffers most because of fluctuations? How is inflation related to economic fluctuations? Why are fluctuations larger in developing economies than in developed economies? <br/><br/>To understand the facts that we will document, we will consider modern general equilibrium theories of aggregate fluctuations. One important class of theories, Real Business Cycle theory, stresses the role of fluctuations in the rate of technology change. A different class of theories stresses the role of fluctuations in aggregate demand, including self-fulfilling changes in consumers' expectations. These theories have very different implications for optimal monetary and fiscal policy, which we will explore and evaluate. <br/><br/>Finally, we will consider the role of linkages between different economies in generating and propagating fluctuations in economic activity. Particular focus will be paid to the different factors at play in developed and developing economies and the causes and consequences of currency crises.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Advanced Topics in Macroeconomics", "title": "WCAS ECON 316-0-20 Advanced Topics in Macroeconomics", "lmod": "5/1/17 8:01 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Martin S Eichenbaum", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "316-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course examines the causes and consequences of growth and fluctuations in aggregate economic activity.
