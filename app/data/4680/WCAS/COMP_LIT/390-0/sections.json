Writers may include Columbus, Cook, Darwin, Coleridge, Dana, Melville, Conrad, Woolf, O'Neill, Joji, Traven, Mutis, and/or Goldman. How have seas, sailors, ships and their cargoes helped to shape our imagination and understanding of major events and processes of modernity, such as the discovery of the New World, slavery, industrial capitalism, marine science, the birth of environmental consciousness, and contemporary globalization? What part did seafaring play in the formation of international legal systems, or in epochal events such as the American and Russian Revolutions? How does the rise in contemporary piracy compare to its \"golden age\" forerunners? How can we discern the history of the \"trackless\" oceans, and how do we imagine their future now that \"90% of everything\" crosses an ocean, and the seas are variously described as rising or dying? Our focus in the course will be on writers listed above, but our approach will be radically interdisciplinary, so we will also watch a few films (by Jacques Cousteau, Gillo Pontecorvo and Allen Sekula), and we will read short excerpts from the disciplines of \"critical theory\" (Heller-Roazen, Foucault, Deleuze, Corbin), labor and economic history (Rediker, Fink, Levinson), and environmental thought (Carson, Alaimo).", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Topics in Comparative Literature", "title": "WCAS COMP_LIT 390-0-20 Topics in Comparative Literature", "lmod": "5/9/17 7:20 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "topic": "Oceanic Studies: Lit & Enviro", "course": "390-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: REASON: Pre-registration is not allowed for this class.
