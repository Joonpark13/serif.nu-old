The goal is for students to develop conceptual tools to read societies and use that to read and make sense of their own surroundings. Some anthropological concepts that students will grapple with are cultural relativism, kinship, reciprocity, social structure, religion, and gender. Students will learn to think critically about the region loosely known as the Middle East, but which may more aptly be called West Asia and North Africa (WANA). The people, their societies, cultures, religions and ways of life, are often stereotyped, misrepresented and misinterpreted in the media and in other corridors of power. How can we study such a vast region to draw more informed conclusions? How can we make sense of the diverse experiences and ways of thought across the many societies? And how can we study the region from within the region? Anthropology is equipped with the tools to think about such questions and unpack the particularities of diverse experiences and ways of life.</p>", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Anthropology Special Topics:", "title": "DOHA ANTHRO 242-0-70 Anthropology Special Topics:", "lmod": "5/11/17 7:01 PM (CT)", "section": "70", "topic": "Intro to Anthro in Middle East", "course": "242-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "<p>This course is a survey course of anthropological concepts and methods using the Middle East as a regional focus.
