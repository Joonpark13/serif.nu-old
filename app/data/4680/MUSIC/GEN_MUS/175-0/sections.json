However, you have to be prepared to spend time attending concerts and listening to examples of classical music (minimally six hours a week) outside of the two required in-class sessions. During classroom sessions and outside work, the instructor and invited guests will attempt to nurture a heightened awareness of the challenges that conductors, opera and music theater directors, and musicians/actors face when preparing for a performance.
