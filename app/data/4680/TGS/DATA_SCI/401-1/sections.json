In this course we will review three such major projects: Earthscope, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) for a broad audience of graduate students interested in data science methods. We will provide an overview of the science that motivated these projects and highlight data challenges and opportunities for all three, including the connectivity, similarities and differences. The course will be guided by project-specific literature developed by the pertinent scientific communities as well as professional articles from astro- and geo-physical journals. Student will work on projects requiring written reports, class presentations, and participation in discussions.", "qtr": "Fall 2017", "name": "Data-Driven Research in Physics, Geophysics, and Astronomy", "title": "TGS DATA_SCI 401-1-1 Data-Driven Research in Physics, Geophysics, and Astronomy", "lmod": "5/2/17 7:30 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "401-1", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Major research projects in earth sciences, physics, and astronomy share a wide range of data-science challenges and opportunities that would benefit from application and development of advanced data management, analysis, and mining methods from applied math, statistics, and computer science.
