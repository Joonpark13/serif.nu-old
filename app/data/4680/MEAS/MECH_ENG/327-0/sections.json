Without thorough understanding of the stress imposed on the structure, and exact computation, these structures would never be possible. This course will familiarize students with the basic concepts of finite-element method for stress analysis, and computer implementation. The course will focus on topic specific programming and usage of commercial codes popular in the industry."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "A First Course in Finite Elements, Ted Belytschko and Jacob Fish, John Wiley, 2007, ISBN 0470035803."}], "instructor": ["Wing K Liu", "Mark A.
