We emphasize the computational principle/algorithmic/behavioral levels of analysis (sensu Marr). A set of matlab-based computational projects based on high resolution motion capture data of fish engaged in behavior (either prey capture behavior in weakly electric fish or in larval zebra fish) are used throughout the course to facilitate our thinking through the problems faced by animals and how the nervous system, body, and environment collaborate in solving them.<br/><br/>Course Format: <br/>The class meets twice a week. I'll set the context for the reading and connect to the key themes, and then we have a discussion of the reading for the class, led by a student chosen at random at the start of the class. Leading discussion requires a detailed and thorough reading of each paper, so this class may not be for you if you have a high course load. As your analysis of animal behavior progresses through the set of computational assignments, this rhythm will be augmented with presentations and discussions of findings.<br/><br/>Assignments: <br/>The bulk of the work in this course falls into two categories. (1) Each week where there is not a computational assignment due there will be a Directed Reading due. These consist of questions on the work you've been assigned to read. All participants are expected to do all assigned readings and to arrive well prepared to lead discussions. (2) A series of computational assignments stepping from basic quantification of kinematics up to analysis of a behavior you've identified within the video. Students with more advanced programming abilities will have the option to pursue calculation of the sensory signals arising during the behavior using pre-established sensor models. (3) A final exam.<br/><br/>Note: In past years I have found that students without coding experience in Matlab do not do well with the substantial computational component. This year for the first time I will I will be offering weekly/or as needed matlab coding help sessions to the class so that students who are comfortable but not expert with matlab can do well with the computational assignments.
