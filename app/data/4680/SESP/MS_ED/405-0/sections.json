Theoretical perspectives will be explored in relation to empirical research, field studies, first person accounts, and imaginative works. Special emphasis will be given to the adolescent's subjective experience and to the remembered accounts of our own adolescence. The course will encompass a life course/life span perspective by exploring the period following adolescence proper (often referred to in the literature as emerging adulthood) to include adult midlife. The course will argue that understanding adolescence is advanced with a corresponding appreciation of adulthood. <br/> <br/>Each course meeting will begin with an orientation to the week's reading in a lecture/discussion format led by the instructor.
