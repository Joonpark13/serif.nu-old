In this class, students learn how to engage and persuade employees to become brand ambassadors with customers, the community where they work and among fellow employees. It's not an easy task. Today's workforce is more diverse than ever, and companies continue to seek greater diversity. There are different levels, education, ethnic and generational cohorts in most companies. There are different languages spoken. Employees may be in one location, spread out around the globe, or a growing number working in a virtual capacity or in constant motion. Reaching employees and communicating effectively with them requires a variety of skills. Students learn how to understand the dynamic employee audience, how to determine what's important, how to create a workplace environment conducive to mobilizing the employees to act effectively and in concert, how to deal with change in the organization and in the work environment, and how to lead when there's a great deal of turbulence and uncertainty."}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:45 PM (CT)", "subject": "IMC"}]
