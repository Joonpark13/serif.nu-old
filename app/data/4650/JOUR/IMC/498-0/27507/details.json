The course will demonstrate that deep consumer insight is available not only from qualitative approaches, but also from data. <br/><br/>It has become increasingly possible to understand consumers through the data trail they leave behind as they engage with brands and enterprises. The course will give students an opportunity to develop deep consumer insight informed by multiple and often conflicting inputs. Assembling and interpreting inputs is increasingly the order of the day in IMC. The course will ask the student to wrestle with these kinds of inputs, to develop a coherent set of strategies informed by insight into the consumer, case studies will provide examples of problems marketers are struggling to solve today, requiring them to wring true insight from data."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "IMC"}]
