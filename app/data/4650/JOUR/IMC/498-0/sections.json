In doing so, the course covers the four aspects of social media: messages, people, networks, and culture. The first section, messages, covers the communication model, the various types of social media, and the relevant channels of communication. The second section, people, focuses on the individual user-experience of new media, including uses and benefits of new media, motivations for participating in new media, and the methods for measuring effectiveness of social media platforms. The third section on networks will cover the basics of network theory, present the research on virtual communities, and discuss co-creation, the process of user interaction and collaboration that results in the production of consumer-generated advertisements, innovations, and other things of value. The final section will cover the relationship between social media and culture, including cultural production and distribution through online channels and the integration of social media into different cultures. Business cases will be used to illustrate concepts, and discussion will be encouraged.", "name": "Practicum", "section": "20", "topic": "Social Media", "course": "498-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:00PM - 8:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/JOUR/IMC/498-0/24226", "instructor": ["Ashlee Amanda Humphreys"], "id": "24226", "subject": "IMC"}, {"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "Social Media provides overview of theories for studying social media from psychology, sociology, and communication and will apply these theories to address strategic problems emerging from the shift toward social media and social media marketing.

The course will give students an opportunity to develop deep consumer insight informed by multiple and often conflicting inputs. Assembling and interpreting inputs is increasingly the order of the day in IMC. The course will ask the student to wrestle with these kinds of inputs, to develop a coherent set of strategies informed by insight into the consumer, case studies will provide examples of problems marketers are struggling to solve today, requiring them to wring true insight from data.", "name": "Practicum", "section": "22", "topic": "Data-Driven Consumer Insight", "course": "498-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:00PM - 8:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/JOUR/IMC/498-0/27507", "instructor": ["Stephen I Hersh"], "id": "27507", "subject": "IMC"}, {"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "Introduction to Strategic Communications emphasizes understanding and communicating with an organization's major stakeholders including employees, customers, investors or donors, government, NGOs and other associations.
