Its history, not to mention contemporary social upheavals, makes it a rich environment for considering the role of media, business, politics and public health in an emerging democracy. Just 25 years since the end of Apartheid, an extreme form of racial segregation and oppression, the country is in swift transition culturally, politically, and economically. This is so partly because democracy and globalization, not to mention HIV, arrived there more or less simultaneously. This course covers the contemporary<br/><br/>history of South Africa, with a special focus on the country's newspapers, magazines, and broadcast outlets. It prepares journalism students for the Residency Program, and global public health students headed for South Africa in spring, but is not limited to them. The course is designed, too, for any student interested in international reporting and/or health reporting. Assignments mimic the steps any journalist might take in preparing to cover stories across lines of geography, language, culture, race, class and ethnicity.", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "International Journalism: South Africa", "title": "JOUR JOUR 372-0-20 International Journalism: South Africa", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:36 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Ava Thompson Greenwell", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "372-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors from every undergraduate school only.", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "South Africa anchors the poorest continent on the globe.
