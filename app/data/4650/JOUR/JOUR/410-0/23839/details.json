We will also examine how our own cultural mores and biases may influence our reporting on other societies, and will review ethical dilemmas unique to foreign reporting. Our goal is to understand contemporary international issues and best practices in international reporting. Another expectation is that you will get practical, nuts-and-bolts information on getting started in a foreign environment. Guests from various publications will visit, either in person or via phone. We will also view several video reports that illustrate and underscore the themes of the class, including ideological and regional conflicts, economics, war reporting and the environment. Students also learn how to get started working a beat in another country."}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
