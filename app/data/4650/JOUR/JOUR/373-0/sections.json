[{"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "The president of the United States is forced to resign. Evidence of genocide is unearthed. Secret prisons are discovered. In each case, investigative reporting has played a key role, and over the years, it has proven to be one of the highest forms of journalism: shedding light on wrongdoing, exposing corruption at the highest levels and taking on powerful people and institutions that have abused their power and the disenfranchised. In this course, we will focus on an important facet of journalism: investigating potentially wrongful convictions. This class isn't about theory; it's about pursuing the truth about real murder cases, interviewing skittish sources in often tough neighborhoods and prisoners serving time?sometimes decades?for crimes they say they didn't commit. Students will be introduced to a variety of investigative techniques, interviewing skills, approaches to developing sources and employing public documents and databases. Of paramount importance in this class: student safety and adhering to the highest ethical standards in journalism. This is a two-unit course in which students are expected to devote a tremendous amount of time in the field?weekdays and weekends?doing real shoe-leather journalism, knocking on doors, digging for information and determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. Keep in mind: Investigative reporting is hard. Expect to confront roadblocks. Anticipate spinning your wheels. There will be frustrations and setbacks. And along the way, hopefully, you will learn to think like an investigative reporter, you will learn by doing and you will do it by the most honorable methods and, so, come closer to discovering the truth?whatever that truth is.
