It's conceptually possible to measure engagement with digital content much more accurately than is possible in traditional media. But the sheer proliferation of content-analytics tools and the fact that different measurement systems yield different - and often conflicting - results makes it challenging to derive useful audience insights. This half-unit class, equally valuable for both journalism and IMC students, will provide a foundational understanding of the many tools that can be used to measure engagement with digital content, with a special focus on Web and social media analytics. Students will examine engagement on one or more real content-driven sites, using analytics data to identify ways of building its audience. Through assignments based on this analytics data, students will learn how to find the right measurements for a journalist's, publisher's or brand's content-engagement goals, and which tools and metrics are best for providing those measurements.", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "Content Analytics", "title": "JOUR JOUR 456-0-21 Content Analytics", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:36 PM (CT)", "section": "21", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Richard   Gordon", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "456-0", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Only students in the MSJ program may enroll in these classes", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "How can we measure whether digital content is reaching its intended audience and truly engaging online and mobile users?
