[{"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "How can we measure whether digital content is reaching its intended audience and truly engaging online and mobile users? It's conceptually possible to measure engagement with digital content much more accurately than is possible in traditional media. But the sheer proliferation of content-analytics tools and the fact that different measurement systems yield different - and often conflicting - results makes it challenging to derive useful audience insights. This half-unit class, equally valuable for both journalism and IMC students, will provide a foundational understanding of the many tools that can be used to measure engagement with digital content, with a special focus on Web and social media analytics. Students will examine engagement on one or more real content-driven sites, using analytics data to identify ways of building its audience. Through assignments based on this analytics data, students will learn how to find the right measurements for a journalist's, publisher's or brand's content-engagement goals, and which tools and metrics are best for providing those measurements.", "name": "Content Analytics", "section": "21", "topic": "", "course": "456-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 1:30PM - 4:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/JOUR/JOUR/456-0/27418", "instructor": ["Richard   Gordon"], "id": "27418", "subject": "JOUR"}]
