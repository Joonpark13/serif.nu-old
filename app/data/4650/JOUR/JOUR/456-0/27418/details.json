It's conceptually possible to measure engagement with digital content much more accurately than is possible in traditional media. But the sheer proliferation of content-analytics tools and the fact that different measurement systems yield different - and often conflicting - results makes it challenging to derive useful audience insights. This half-unit class, equally valuable for both journalism and IMC students, will provide a foundational understanding of the many tools that can be used to measure engagement with digital content, with a special focus on Web and social media analytics. Students will examine engagement on one or more real content-driven sites, using analytics data to identify ways of building its audience. Through assignments based on this analytics data, students will learn how to find the right measurements for a journalist's, publisher's or brand's content-engagement goals, and which tools and metrics are best for providing those measurements."}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
