[{"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "Health and Science Reporting teaches students both how to think about science writing and how to write about science and medicine. In this combination writing workshop and seminar we will read some of the best of the best science and health journalism; meet with expert scientists on campus; and meet the editors and writers from leading scientific journals and publications. Students will learn what makes good science writing, how to find sources, how to evaluate information and how to sort out science from pseudo-science. Assignments will include student debates, critiques of science coverage in newspapers, magazines, television, radio and the Web, science/health/medicine journal rewrites, news briefs, an in-depth narrative story on a science topic of students' own choosing, and an opportunity to write live copy for a science magazine or website.", "name": "Health and Science Reporting", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "383-0", "meeting_time": ["Fr 10:00AM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/JOUR/JOUR/383-0/23861", "instructor": ["Patti Lynne Wolter"], "id": "23861", "subject": "JOUR"}]
