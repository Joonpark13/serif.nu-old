Through classroom and real-world experience, you will explore the power, limits and moral complexities of investigative reporting and encounter its struggles and triumphs firsthand. The class, co-taught by a Chicago Tribune reporter, will directly pursue a real-world journalism project. You should expect to spend significant time during and outside class hours conducting research and fieldwork and producing status reports.
