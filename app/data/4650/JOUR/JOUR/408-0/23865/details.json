Photojournalists are reporters who communicate through pictures, and photojournalism is a particular type of photography. Students will learn the art of photographic storytelling. The course will train their visual sense, as they learn how to see the world around them differently. Students also learn to edit pictures thoughtfully to enhance the power, nuance and clarity of the story. Medill cameras are provided for use in this class. Students learn the manual controls for precise composition and overall photographic effects and become proficient in using the camera and associated tools to produce powerful images. Course also covers the ethical responsibility of the photojournalist. Group critiquing is part of the learning process. Students will also blog.
