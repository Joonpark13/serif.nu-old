[{"school": "JOUR", "overview_of_class": "Storytelling: Interactive News explores how storytelling changes across various platforms-and how it must change when interactivity causes narrative to be user-defined. This course builds on the foundations of audio, photo, and video and adds interactivity to the mix, enabling students to create and build dynamic, interactive narratives for news and feature reporting. Students will split their time between reporting, multimedia editing, and learning open-web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).", "name": "Storytelling: Interactive News", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "320-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 10:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/JOUR/JOUR/320-0/23813", "instructor": ["Jill   Braverman"], "id": "23813", "subject": "JOUR"}]
