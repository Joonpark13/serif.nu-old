Collectively, they're part of a $200 billion industry. And within this realm all of the elements of our society are displayed: heroism and failure, racial harmony and discrimination, drugs, religion and crime. That's why it's so important to be aware of and capable of weighing in on all current issues, not just the latest sports results.<br/><br/>Students will learn to coalesce their observations, opinions and experiences into compelling arguments that reflect the essence of the sports column: &quot;I'm right, and this is why.&quot;"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Sophomore standing"}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:45 PM (CT)", "subject": "JOUR"}]
