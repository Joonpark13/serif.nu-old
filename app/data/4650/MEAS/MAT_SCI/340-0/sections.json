[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "The steps in production of fired ceramic articles, including powder preparation, compaction and forming, and firing, will be studied. The following list of topics will be covered: powder synthesis and characterization; compact formation by pressing, colloidal processing, and extrusion; firing, including chemical and physical changes during liquid and solid state sintering. The interrelationships between processing as it controls the final microstructure and subsequent properties of ceramic materials will be explored.", "name": "Ceramic Processing", "section": "20", "location": "Frances Searle Building 2107", "topic": "", "course": "340-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 2:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/MEAS/MAT_SCI/340-0/24280", "instructor": ["Scott A Barnett"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "24280", "subject": "MAT_SCI"}]
