The following list of topics will be covered: powder synthesis and characterization; compact formation by pressing, colloidal processing, and extrusion; firing, including chemical and physical changes during liquid and solid state sintering. The interrelationships between processing as it controls the final microstructure and subsequent properties of ceramic materials will be explored."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Three one hour lectures and one lab per week."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Quizzes - 50%; Homework - 30%; Lab reports - 20%"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "James S.
