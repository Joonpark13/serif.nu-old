[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "This course covers the theory and application of atomic-scale computational materials tools to model, understand, and predict the properties of real materials. The course will cover quantum-mechanical electronic structure methods (such as density-functional theory), classical force fields, and molecular dynamics. Laboratories on each of these topics will give students extensive hands-on experience with several powerful modern materials modeling codes. The basic theoretical background behind these computational methods will be discussed, but the course will also emphasize practical methods for calculating physical properties of materials.", "name": "Atomic Scale Computational Materials Science", "section": "20", "location": "Frances Searle Building 1441", "topic": "", "course": "458-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 9:00AM - 9:50AM", "Tu 9:00AM - 9:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/MEAS/MAT_SCI/458-0/24400", "instructor": ["Christopher M Wolverton"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "24400", "subject": "MAT_SCI"}]
