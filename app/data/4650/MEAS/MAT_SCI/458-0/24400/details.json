The course will cover quantum-mechanical electronic structure methods (such as density-functional theory), classical force fields, and molecular dynamics. Laboratories on each of these topics will give students extensive hands-on experience with several powerful modern materials modeling codes. The basic theoretical background behind these computational methods will be discussed, but the course will also emphasize practical methods for calculating physical properties of materials."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "MSE 401 and 405, or equivalent background in quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and general materials science; please seek consent of instructor if unsure."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "4 lectures per week"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Computational lab assignments and one major project"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "There is no required text for this course.
