[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "Catalog Description: <br/>Introduction to the physical principles underlying the electronic structure and the electronic and thermal properties of solids from macroscopic to nanometer dimensions. General quantum mechanics and solid state physics will be taught in the context of technological applications, including the structure of solids, behavior of electrons and atomic vibration in periodic lattice, and interaction of light with solids. Emphasis will be on metals and semiconductors and the materials physics of electronic and optoelectronic devices.<br/><br/>Course Topics: <br/>Electrical and Thermal Conduction in Solids, Elementary Quantum Physics, Modern Theory of Solids, Semiconductors.", "name": "Introductory Physics of Materials", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "351-1", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/MEAS/MAT_SCI/351-1/24281", "instructor": ["Gerald Jeffrey Snyder"], "id": "24281", "subject": "MAT_SCI"}]
