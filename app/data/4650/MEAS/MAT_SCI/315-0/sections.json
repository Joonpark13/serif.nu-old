[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "Course Objectives: <br/>1.) The objectives of this course are to develop an understanding of free enery vs. temperature relationships in binary and ternary phase diagrams, including fundamental electrochemical understanding and 2.) to develop an understanding of point defects and their role in diffusion. <br/><br/>Course Outcomes:<br/>A student completing this course should be able to:<br/>1. Relate free energy vs. temperature and composition relationships to binary phase diagrams<br/>2. Solve basic electrochemistry problems<br/>3. Interpret ternary phase diagrams<br/>4. Use modern software programs to predict free energy functions and the related phase diagrams<br/>5. Describe the relationship between point defects and the role of diffusion in solids<br/>6. Describe the equilibrium thermodynamics of point defects in crystalline ionic and non-ionic solids<br/>7. Describe the Kirkendall effect, diffusion in ternary systems, and the importance of short-circuit diffusion <br/><br/>Relationship to Department Outcomes: <br/>Supports 2, 3, 4, 5", "name": "Phase Equilibria & Diffusion of Materials", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute LG52", "topic": "", "course": "315-0", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeFr 2:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/MEAS/MAT_SCI/315-0/24277", "instructor": ["Christopher M Wolverton"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "24277", "subject": "MAT_SCI"}]
