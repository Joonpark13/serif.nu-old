[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "Geometric modeling, dimensioning systems, tolerances, design for manufacture, programming of machine tools. Team problem solving in a design and manufacturing technology environment. <br/><br/>Any student who is interested in solid modeling and wants to have some practical experiences in the &quot;from art to part&quot; process should take this course. ME 340-2 is usually taken by juniors to graduate students majoring in Mechanical Engineering, Manufacturing, and Industrial Engineering. <br/><br/>It offers both the fundamental knowledge for being a successful engineer or manager in manufacturing, and practical skills. It includes GD&amp;T, statistical tolerances, and metrology tools. The practical side of this course includes: Design of a plastic part within the specified domain, creating a solid model of the part, design of the injection molding tool, creating a solid model of the tooling, creating a cutting path, downloading the cutting path to a CNC machine, machining, injection molding the part, and finally measuring the part geometry and comparing to the original design. <br/><br/>Sample past examples are: the relaxing palm beach with attractive fish, the vexing maze, the scary vampire teeth, the daily-used items (trash-can, scissors and key-chain) and the mini-models of transportation tools (unicycle, car and helicopter).", "name": "Computer Integ Manufacturing: CAD/CAM", "section": "01", "topic": "CAD/CAM", "course": "340-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/MEAS/MECH_ENG/340-2/20818", "instructor": ["Michael Joseph Beltran"], "id": "20818", "subject": "MECH_ENG"}]
