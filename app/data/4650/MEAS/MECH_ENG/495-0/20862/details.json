Key decisions in life prediction, evaluation of repair-rehabilitation schemes and the development of new material systems rely on a modern view of fracture mechanics. This course introduces the subject from an engineering perspective with an emphasis on the underlying mechanics of linear and nonlinear crack front fields, the application of numerical analysis methods and the evaluation-interpretation of experimentally measured fracture properties of materials. It also covers the recent applications of fracture mechanics to thin films and microelectronics."}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:44 PM (CT)", "subject": "MECH_ENG"}]
