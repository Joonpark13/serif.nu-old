Concepts that are developed in class will be applied in a series of programming-based homework assignments and projects. We will study several discretization methods, including the finite volume method, the finite element method, and the hybrid control volume finite element method (CVFEM), while discussing numerical modeling concepts (like conservation and stability) that are common to all methods. Specific physical modeling topics that will be covered are turbulence modeling (include basic turbulent flow physics, Reynolds averaged models, and Large Eddy Simulation), and techniques for modeling flows with moving boundaries and fluid-structure interaction. Other advanced topics that may be covered if time allows include lattice-Boltzmann techniques, vortex-based methods, meshless methods, and space-time finite element methods.", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "Advanced Topics in Computational Fluid Dynamics", "title": "MEAS MECH_ENG 424-0-1 Advanced Topics in Computational Fluid Dynamics", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:35 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-4138", "instructor_name": "Gregory J.

However, students will benefit from having had previous exposure to an advanced fluid dynamics class (such as ME 425). Also helpful are previous classes in CFD (e.g. ME 423), finite element analysis (e.g. ME/CEE 327, 426-1, or 426-2), or more general numerical methods (e.g. ESAM 446-1). Familiarity with MATLAB is assumed for homework assignments.
