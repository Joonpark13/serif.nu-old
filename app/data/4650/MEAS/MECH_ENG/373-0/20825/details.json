ME undergraduates are required to take either Thermodynamics II (ME 370) or this course as a part of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum. Most undergraduates take it during their junior year. <br/><br/>This course essentially picks up where ME 241 left off. Unlike ME 241 where the subject of fluid mechanics was developed by &quot;synthesis&quot; starting from elementary ideas on the nature of fluids, this course takes as its starting point the fundamental equations of fluid flow and proceeds by way of &quot;analysis&quot; to explore its myriad consequences and applications.These areas are laid out as broad swaths of contiguous &quot;territories&quot;: viscous flows, inviscid flows, &quot;almost&quot; inviscid flows (boundary layer theory), compressible flows and so on. As we travel through this &quot;landscape&quot;, theoretical principles are applied to a wide variety of practical problems."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisite: MECH_ENG 220, MECH_ENG 241, or equivalent."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Homework, Mid-term, Take-home exam, Final exam."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "value": "Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics, Munson, Young, Okiishi, 6th edition, Wiley 2009, ISBN 9780470262849"}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:43 PM (CT)", "subject": "MECH_ENG"}]
