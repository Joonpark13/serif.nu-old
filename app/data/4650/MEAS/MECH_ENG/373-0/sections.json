[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "ME 373 is the second course in fluid mechanics for undergraduates. ME undergraduates are required to take either Thermodynamics II (ME 370) or this course as a part of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum. Most undergraduates take it during their junior year. <br/><br/>This course essentially picks up where ME 241 left off. Unlike ME 241 where the subject of fluid mechanics was developed by \"synthesis\" starting from elementary ideas on the nature of fluids, this course takes as its starting point the fundamental equations of fluid flow and proceeds by way of \"analysis\" to explore its myriad consequences and applications.These areas are laid out as broad swaths of contiguous \"territories\": viscous flows, inviscid flows, \"almost\" inviscid flows (boundary layer theory), compressible flows and so on. As we travel through this \"landscape\", theoretical principles are applied to a wide variety of practical problems.", "name": "Engineering Fluid Mechanics", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "373-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/MEAS/MECH_ENG/373-0/20825", "instructor": ["Neelesh A Patankar"], "id": "20825", "subject": "MECH_ENG"}]
