Using the building blocks of story as a foundation, the course will cover the art of graphic facilitation, illustrated journey maps, storyboarding, animatics, and narrative video. Deliverables for the first 5 weeks will be completed by hand, the last 5 weeks will use computers to achieve the desired end result. This course will balance rote practice (muscle-building for rapid visualization), a personal inventory of visual elements and shorthand, and the craft of time-based mediums and narrative framing."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Priority given to MS EDI students."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:41 PM (CT)", "subject": "DSGN"}]
