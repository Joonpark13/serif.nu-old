[{"school": "MEAS", "overview_of_class": "This course explores a broad definition of \"story\" and introduces techniques for crafting, visualizing, and sharing in both analog and digital forms. Using the building blocks of story as a foundation, the course will cover the art of graphic facilitation, illustrated journey maps, storyboarding, animatics, and narrative video. Deliverables for the first 5 weeks will be completed by hand, the last 5 weeks will use computers to achieve the desired end result. This course will balance rote practice (muscle-building for rapid visualization), a personal inventory of visual elements and shorthand, and the craft of time-based mediums and narrative framing.", "name": "Special Topics in Engineering Design", "section": "39", "location": "Ford Eng Design Cntr G-201", "topic": "Visual Storytelling", "course": "495-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:30PM - 9:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/MEAS/DSGN/495-0/25862", "instructor": ["Anthony Michael Garcia, JR"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "25862", "subject": "DSGN"}]
