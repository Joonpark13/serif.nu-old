Students will learn key methods of design innovation and will work in teams to apply those methods, learning how to uncover opportunities, explore ideas, prototype solutions, and interact with users. In addition to regular class time, the course will offer a series of workshops to help students develop specific design skills which suit the interests and needs of the class. Students will be required to participate in at least one workshop but may engage in as many as desired. At the end of the quarter, students will present their design concepts, showcasing prototypes in engaging and thoughtful ways. Open to all Northwestern students.<br/><br/>Students who have taken DTC will not receive credit for taking DTD."}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:41 PM (CT)", "subject": "DSGN"}]
