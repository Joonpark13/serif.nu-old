Both classical and computer tools will be incorporated and complemented each other in the course. Experimentation using strain gages to measure structural responses will be compared with theoretical analysis presented in this course. At the end of this course, you will have the ability to:<br/><br/>1.analyze a structure with non-prismatic members using consistent displacement method using virtual work, slope deflection, and moment distribution;<br/>2.determine the maximum design force using influence lines for floor systems and indeterminate structures;<br/>3.analyze structures using commercial software and/or design worksheet to perform the analysis;<br/>4.conduct experiments that could measure the response of a structure under static loads; and <br/>5.perform preliminary analysis using approximate methods."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "CLASS SCHEDULE / Two 1 and 1/2 hour lectures and a one-hour required discussion section for 10 weeks per quarter.<br/><br/>COMPUTER USAGE / Use of MATLAB or spreadsheet software to solve and present graphically effects of parameter variation in structures Introduction to and use of the FRAME computer program<br/><br/>1.
