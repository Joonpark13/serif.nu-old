[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Any introduction to creative enterprise must include an overview of the key concepts and tools of finance, because an enterprise is a business, and the language of business is finance. Since creative enterprises offer many diverse opportunities and challenges, all business activities need to be supported by the appropriate financial tools and metrics to maximize those opportunities, overcome those challenges, and help bring creative ideas to fruition. This course will give students an understanding of the language of business by studying key aspects of economics, accounting, and corporate finance. With that foundational knowledge in hand, students will explore what types of funding are available and how to access the right source of capital for each type of venture. Translating a creative concept into a language of finance is the key skill needed to launch any idea as every potential funding sources asks for certain financial information. This course will teach students how to frame creative activities with the language of business and speak intelligently about the financial data behind any new creative enterprise.", "name": "Introduction to Creative Enterprise", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "468-0", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 5:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SoC/MSLCE/468-0/28058", "instructor": ["Cory P Sandrock"], "id": "28058", "subject": "MSLCE"}]
