Students will learn how to identify and systematically dissect, or deconstruct, these beliefs, with the ultimate goal of reconstituting them into their own well-reasoned, personally satisfying philosophy of communication. <br/><br/>The readings for the course, broadly chosen from across the humanities and social sciences, have been purposefully selected to enable this approach."}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:45 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
