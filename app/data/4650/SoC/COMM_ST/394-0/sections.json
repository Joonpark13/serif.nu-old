The concept of \"health\" will be broadly interpreted, including physical and psychological health.<br/>This course addresses the intersection of family members as they address the issues of health. It will examine: (1) family theories that shed light on such interactions, (2) communication patterns that tend to emerge around certain health-related issues. This course explores the intersection of illness/disability/death and family communication. Relying on a set of theoretical frameworks. including family systems theory, topics to be addressed include: child and adult cancer, addictions, genetics, disabilities, death, cultural health norms, and health prevention practices.<br/>This course is designed specifically to focus on both academic and professional writing. Therefore the topic of writing will be addressed in most classes and assignments will be designed to foster skill development in writing for the public as well as an academic audience.
