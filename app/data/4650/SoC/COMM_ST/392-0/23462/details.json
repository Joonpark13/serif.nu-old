The current phase of globalization is primarily driven by economics forces leading to a world-wide integration of markets and finances and by technological innovations shaping mobility and connectivity in our knowledge/ information based world. The course begins by critically attending to a set of techno-economic features of globalization. Upon completing that task, with time permitting, we will address cultural and political issues that arise with globalization. <br/>Since we live in a world primarily structured and propelled by global capitalism, we will focus on a set of intriguing and powerful global corporations and their practices (both commercial and cultural)- Amazon, Apple, Nike, Walmart, and others. The course will focus on following four topics: global flows, the new geography of jobs, the retailing revolution, and creative cultural economies. In addition, we will explore some, but not all of the following topics: diaspora, hybrid identities, time-space compression, stranger sociability; the repositioning (rather than the decline) of nation-state, the rise of the multinational corporations, the emergence of the NGOs (non-governmental organizations), the flat world vs. the slum world; global media and cultural imperialism and the ethics of globalization."}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
