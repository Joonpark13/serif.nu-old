The current phase of globalization is primarily driven by economics forces leading to a world-wide integration of markets and finances and by technological innovations shaping mobility and connectivity in our knowledge/ information based world. The course begins by critically attending to a set of techno-economic features of globalization. Upon completing that task, with time permitting, we will address cultural and political issues that arise with globalization. <br/>Since we live in a world primarily structured and propelled by global capitalism, we will focus on a set of intriguing and powerful global corporations and their practices (both commercial and cultural)- Amazon, Apple, Nike, Walmart, and others. The course will focus on following four topics: global flows, the new geography of jobs, the retailing revolution, and creative cultural economies. In addition, we will explore some, but not all of the following topics: diaspora, hybrid identities, time-space compression, stranger sociability; the repositioning (rather than the decline) of nation-state, the rise of the multinational corporations, the emergence of the NGOs (non-governmental organizations), the flat world vs. the slum world; global media and cultural imperialism and the ethics of globalization.", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "Global Culture, Commerce and Communication", "title": "SoC COMM_ST 392-0-20 Global Culture, Commerce and Communication", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:36 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-5853", "instructor_name": "Dilip P Gaonkar", "instructor_addr": "2240 Campus Dr. Rm 2-148 Frances Searle Building"}], "topic": "", "course": "392-0", "enrl_requirement": "<br/>Add Consent: Instructor Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course will discuss the issues (problems, challenges, and opportunities) arising from the confluence of commerce, culture and politics under the current regime of globalization.
