[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course will discuss the issues (problems, challenges, and opportunities) arising from the confluence of commerce, culture and politics under the current regime of globalization. The current phase of globalization is primarily driven by economics forces leading to a world-wide integration of markets and finances and by technological innovations shaping mobility and connectivity in our knowledge/ information based world. The course begins by critically attending to a set of techno-economic features of globalization. Upon completing that task, with time permitting, we will address cultural and political issues that arise with globalization. <br/>Since we live in a world primarily structured and propelled by global capitalism, we will focus on a set of intriguing and powerful global corporations and their practices (both commercial and cultural)- Amazon, Apple, Nike, Walmart, and others. The course will focus on following four topics: global flows, the new geography of jobs, the retailing revolution, and creative cultural economies. In addition, we will explore some, but not all of the following topics: diaspora, hybrid identities, time-space compression, stranger sociability; the repositioning (rather than the decline) of nation-state, the rise of the multinational corporations, the emergence of the NGOs (non-governmental organizations), the flat world vs. the slum world; global media and cultural imperialism and the ethics of globalization.", "name": "Global Culture, Commerce and Communication", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "392-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SoC/COMM_ST/392-0/23462", "instructor": ["Dilip P Gaonkar"], "id": "23462", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
