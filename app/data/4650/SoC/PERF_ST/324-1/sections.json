[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Guest artist Alex Benjamin (NU SoC 2015) is a Chicago-based director, writer, and drag performer. This winter, he is beginning to gather materials and approaches for a script he hopes to complete and produce in Chicago before the end of 2018. The production he imagines will include a combination of adapted and devised material, including personal narratives of the performers, to explore the relationship between drag performance and the first Oz novel by L. Frank Baum, best known through its MGM screen adaptation (1939). Paul Edwards, a faculty member in Performance Studies, is a Chicago-based director and writer, and a three-time winner of the Joseph Jefferson Award for original stage adaptations, including the script for Geoff Ryman's Oz-themed novel Was (produced by Roadworks, 1996). In 2014, Edwards mentored Benjamin's Undergraduate Research Grant work on a new play, The Zone, about the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986; the project won the Fletcher URG Award in fall 2014. This winter's workshop class will enroll fifteen students, who will develop original performances at three points in the quarter.", "name": "Presentational Aesthetics", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "324-1", "meeting_time": ["Fr 12:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SoC/PERF_ST/324-1/21657", "instructor": ["Paul C Edwards"], "id": "21657", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
