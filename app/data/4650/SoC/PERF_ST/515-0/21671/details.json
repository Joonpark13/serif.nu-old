Rather than assume that popular culture is by definition ?western' or ?secular,' we will engage with a number of case studies worldwide that connect, historically and politically, local frameworks and broader contexts of understanding. We focus on spaces in which social actors become active producers, not passive consumers of either experiences or products, while also attending to instances in which popular culture reinforces, adapts, and resists hegemonic forces. Key questions include: Which conceptual categories does popular culture contrast with, implicitly or explicitly? How do expressive practices of popular culture convey, challenge, and influence social values, norms of behavior, and sense of identity, in global and historical contexts as well as among diverse groups within societies? How do pleasure, leisure, and fun challenge approaches based on hegemony and regimes of power? And, finally, how does performance studies' engagement with embodiment, event, and agency diffract the central tenets of popular culture theory?"}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "PERF_ST"}]
