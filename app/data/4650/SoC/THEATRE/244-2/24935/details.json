We will read writers associated with the rise of such influential movements as absurdism (Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter) and postmodernism (Caryl Churchill, Sarah Kane, and Marie Irene Fornes). Yet we will also read playwrights (such as Arthur Miller and Alice Childress) who modified the conventions of naturalism to suit their needs. Classes in theatre and literary history sometimes tend to foreground formal innovation at the expense of other concerns. To counteract this, even as we study changes in theatrical forms, we will spend over half of our time reading texts written by women and writers of color who sometimes used the new forms, or who sometimes chose to write in modes from which theatrical elites tended to distance themselves. We will be looking for a balanced overview of what was going on during this incredibly fertile period of theatre history. To do this we will not only read plays by writers of many backgrounds, we will also examine readings from the political theory, psychology, and philosophy of the period.<br/> <br/>Students will have homework assignments, reading quizzes, two 3-4 page essays, and one 8-10 page essay."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Class participation"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Discussion section"}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
