We consider the challenges faced by women playwrights around the world and their concerns and techniques in addressing topics ranging from feminism, identity and community formation, civil rights, war and gender violence to social transformation. Inspired by the collection Contemporary Women Playwrights: Into the Twenty-First Century, the course will be organized into three units to examine 1) how the history of feminism informs women's playwriting and the reimagining of women's historical experiences, 2) how women playwrights engage with pressing social and political issues of our times, and 3) how women playwrights use dramaturgical innovations as a mode of critical intervention. Playwrights may include Carmen Aguirre, Caryl Churchill, Marie Clements, Yael Farber, Lara Foot-Newton, debbie tucker green, Katori Hall, Sarah Kane, Lisa Kron, Deb Margolin, Lynn Nottage, Suzan-Lori Parks, Sarah Ruhl, Mirna Sakhleh, Djanet Sears, Diana Son, Caridad Svich, and Judith Thompson."}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
