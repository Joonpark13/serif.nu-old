Students will work on applying research to real world production situations, and they will practice writing for different audiences (Artistic Directors, subscription audiences, student groups, etc.). In a new twist, it will be taught in collaboration with the Graduate Dramaturgy course taught by Dassia Posner, and there will be one coordinated project between the two classes, as well as shared guest speakers. For their final project, students will create study guides for a production of their choice."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
