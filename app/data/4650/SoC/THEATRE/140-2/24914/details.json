Through Lorca's work as a playwright, poet, puppeteer, and painter we will investigate theatre as a production process, audience engagement experience, and form of political expression. Like all Theatre 140-2 courses, this class introduces students to university-level research-paper writing that incorporates performance analysis and secondary sources. This course mixes lectures, discussion, and writing to explore methods for theatre history performance critique."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
