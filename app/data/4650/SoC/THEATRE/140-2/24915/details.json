We will examine Death and the King's Horseman (Nigeria) by Wole Soyinka, Anowa (Ghana) by Ama Ata Aidoo, and Amajuba (South Africa) by Yael Farber and investigate their greater contexts through cultural and political history, production reconstruction, and textual analysis. Like all Theatre 140-2 courses, this class introduces students to university-level research-paper writing that incorporates performance analysis and secondary sources. This course mixes lectures, discussion, and writing to explore methods for theatre history performance critique."}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "THEATRE"}]
