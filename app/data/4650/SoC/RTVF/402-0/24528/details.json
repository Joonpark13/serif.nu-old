Many of these (liveness, flow, intimacy, etc.) have variously been considered key aspects of the medium's ontology, specificity, ideology, and/or textuality. The meanings of some of these terms has changed and mutated. The class will consider the ways in which foundational concepts may be as strongly grounded in specific historical, technological, or geopolitical conditions as they are inherent attributes of the medium. In this context, we will assess key concepts in terms of what television &quot;is&quot; (as well as what it was and what it might become). The class will also explore various forms that television has taken in terms of genre and narrative. In this context, students will have the opportunity to engage with specific television forms/texts, and the terminologies scholars have used to account for variations, permutations, and developments in television's narrative modes. <br/><br/>Raymond Williams, Television: Technology and Cultural Form<br/>Milly Buonanno, The Age of Television: Experiences and Theories<br/>Additional Readings"}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
