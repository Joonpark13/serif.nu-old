Throughout the history of cinema, however, filmmakers have been complicating and questioning these distinctions, and producing powerful results (e.g. Robert Flaherty, Jean Rouch, Barbara Loden, Chantal Ackerman, Abbas Kiarostami, Pedro Costa, Jia Zhangke, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, to name a few). Through a survey of works that explore hybridity, short written responses, and short production assignments, students will gain not only a broader understanding of hybrid film history but also a range of approaches to hybrid film production.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>No textbook required. Readings will be distributed in Canvas.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>NOTE: there is an additional (optional) Tuesday evening screening 6-9pm that will be held as needed."}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
