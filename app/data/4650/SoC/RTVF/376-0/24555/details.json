We will learn the basics of procedural thinking and create interactive dynamic compositions, applets, and games by using an open source environment, Processing. The course will enable participants to create their own tools for interaction, movement, and form. Participants who do not plan to pursue programming will have the essential knowledge about procedural thinking and gain tools to communicate efficiently with programmers and establish interdisciplinary collaborations. In addition to weekly design assignments, we will explore interactive games and art works via presentations of participants along with assigned readings.<br/><br/>Required Text<br/>Processing: A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists, Edition: 2, Casey Reas, Ben Fry ISBN: 9780262028288 Publisher: MIT Press Publication Date: 12/26/2014 Amazon $59.10, Used: 42.85"}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
