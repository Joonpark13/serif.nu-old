[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "RTVF 395-0 - 20 Computer Animation: 3D<br/> <br/>COURSE DESCRIPTION<br/>This course will introduce fundamental concepts in 3D modeling and animation as digital extensions of drawing and moving image media. Students will respond to a series of conceptual challenges by practically demonstrating techniques learned in lecture, discussion, and workshop. Students will be evaluated through active participation, individual exercises, reading responses, presentations, and unit projects in group critique. The course is designed for students with no prior 3D modeling and animation experience, although students with experience are welcome to enroll.<br/> <br/>LEARNING OUTCOMES<br/>By the end of the quarter students should have a strong understanding of the field of 3D modeling and animation. Students should also have a working understanding of fundamental 3D modeling and animation techniques as well as how to choose the most effective and meaningful approach for a particular concept.<br/> <br/>MATERIALS<br/>Readings will be provided as pdf or web documents.<br/>Maya 2016 (provided on computers in Louis 128)", "name": "Computer Animation: 3D", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 1:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SoC/RTVF/395-0/27479", "instructor": ["Charles Stephen Evans"], "id": "27479", "subject": "RTVF"}]
