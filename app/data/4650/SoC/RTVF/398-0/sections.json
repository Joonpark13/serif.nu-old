It may be deeply personal, but may equally be provoked publically, through objects, images, sounds, and stories. There are nostalgia films, and films that trigger nostalgia?and these are not necessarily the same thing. Nostalgia is about longing and the past?remembered and forgotten, actual and imagined?but it is not quite the same as history, memory, or trauma. This class explores some of the prominent ideas about nostalgia, especially ones developed in the context of film, television, and cultural studies. The class considers nostalgia in popular media, emphasizing the kinds of aesthetic/narrative practices that are most liable to be considered \"nostalgic.\" Media texts include: Midnight in Paris, American Graffiti, and Pleasantville, and television programs such as Mad Men and Pushing Daisies.<br/><br/>Class requirements: Attendance at screenings/lectures; participation in class discussion; weekly reading assignments and assigned reading responses; two short papers; take-home final. <br/><br/>Required reading packet will be approx. $30.00<br/>Depending on what students choose to write about, they may have to make additional investment to access specific films/TV", "name": "Symposium: Issues in RTVF", "section": "21", "topic": "Nostalgia & Pop Culture", "course": "398-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:00PM - 5:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SoC/RTVF/398-0/24501", "instructor": ["Miriam B White"], "id": "24501", "subject": "RTVF"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "RTVF 398 - Showrunners and Writer-Producers<br/>Dr. Molly A. Schneider<br/><br/>Course Description:<br/>This course will examine the role of television showrunners and writer-producers in the United States, addressing both their emergence as industrial categories and their significance in media culture. From Rod Serling to Norman Lear to David Lynch to Tina Fey to Jenji Kohan to Shonda Rhimes, showrunners and writer-producers have become central figures in the evolution of television as a medium. Combining both managerial and creative roles, showrunners and writer-producers function as television auteurs in complex and rapidly evolving ways. How have they shaped artistic content and style? How have they operated in relation to the business of television? How has their work become a platform for discussing larger socio-cultural issues - such as gender, race and representation, and politics - both in and through television?<br/><br/>Learning Objectives:<br/><br/>Students will be able to chart the historical development of the television showrunner and writer-producer in the United States, identify their evolving industrial and artistic roles, and recognize their larger socio-cultural significance in the media landscape.<br/><br/>Evaluation Method:<br/>Class participation, blog posts, 2-3 short papers, and a final project.<br/><br/>Class Materials:<br/><br/>Bennett, Tara.

We begin from the premise that media and food are connected on two interrelated levels: food is both the subject of media and is a medium itself, through which ideas about gender, race, nation, domesticity, and the world beyond home are conveyed. Our guiding questions throughout the term will be: How does food serve as a point of entry for considering issues such as globalization, poverty, wealth, capitalism, leisure, work, identity, family, and belonging? How do food media, such as restaurant reviews, cookbooks, documentaries, and cooking shows, seek to intervene in public understandings of health, cuisine, and culture more broadly? And how are global food cultures represented, celebrated, or marginalized in American media? <br/><br/><br/><br/>Course Objectives: By the end of this course, students will:<br/><br/>Understand, evaluate, and be able to discuss a number of different lenses for the study of food media and culture, including semiotic, structural, performative, anthropological, and feminist approaches<br/>Apply these methods to their own written analyses of food media<br/>Sustain a lively critical community via class discussions<br/>Critically evaluate, via written assignments, the construction of food semiotics as they are mobilized to convey meanings and ideological messages<br/>Critically evaluate, via written assignments, the concepts and theories elaborated in the scholarly work we read<br/>Course Evaluations: attendance and participation, two papers, reading responses, final paper presentation<br/><br/>Books required: Polan, Dana B.
