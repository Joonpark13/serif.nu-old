Schneider<br/><br/>Course Description:<br/>This course will examine the role of television showrunners and writer-producers in the United States, addressing both their emergence as industrial categories and their significance in media culture. From Rod Serling to Norman Lear to David Lynch to Tina Fey to Jenji Kohan to Shonda Rhimes, showrunners and writer-producers have become central figures in the evolution of television as a medium. Combining both managerial and creative roles, showrunners and writer-producers function as television auteurs in complex and rapidly evolving ways. How have they shaped artistic content and style? How have they operated in relation to the business of television? How has their work become a platform for discussing larger socio-cultural issues - such as gender, race and representation, and politics - both in and through television?<br/><br/>Learning Objectives:<br/><br/>Students will be able to chart the historical development of the television showrunner and writer-producer in the United States, identify their evolving industrial and artistic roles, and recognize their larger socio-cultural significance in the media landscape.<br/><br/>Evaluation Method:<br/>Class participation, blog posts, 2-3 short papers, and a final project.<br/><br/>Class Materials:<br/><br/>Bennett, Tara.
