[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "THE LONG TAKE<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The average shot length in most broadcast documentaries and some action blockbusters constitutes only a few seconds. Sometimes less is less. This course explores the expressive and conceptual possibilities of the long take, or plan sequence, which can be understood as both a shot of significant duration and as the very ground of mise-en-scene. Through screenings, readings, short response papers, and short production assignments organized around the long take and single-shot cinema, students will gain the technical and conceptual skills to consider duration and execute long takes, and incorporate them into their artistic toolbox. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>No textbook required. Readings will be distributed via Canvas.", "name": "Topics in Cinematography", "section": "20", "location": "Louis Hall 105", "topic": "The Long Take", "course": "374-0", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SoC/RTVF/374-0/24576", "instructor": ["John Paul Sniadecki"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "24576", "subject": "RTVF"}]
