Sometimes less is less. This course explores the expressive and conceptual possibilities of the long take, or plan sequence, which can be understood as both a shot of significant duration and as the very ground of mise-en-scene. Through screenings, readings, short response papers, and short production assignments organized around the long take and single-shot cinema, students will gain the technical and conceptual skills to consider duration and execute long takes, and incorporate them into their artistic toolbox. <br/><br/> <br/><br/>No textbook required. Readings will be distributed via Canvas."}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
