All principal photography or prototype construction should be finished by the start of the quarter so that students can engage primarily in post-production (image and sound editing) of the thesis project, with emphasis placed on transitioning from assemblage to refined structure and picture-lock. Throughout the course and according to a designated schedule, students will present works-in-progress to classmates, the instructor, and guests for collective feedback and evaluation. During class meetings we will chiefly focus on work-shopping your projects, sharing and analyzing questions and concerns of post-production, considering a range of<br/>creative strategies, and engaging with critical readings and discussions. Students will come out of the class with picture-lock of their thesis, and ready to undertake sound design and mix, color correction, titling, and exhibition in Thesis III.<br/><br/>Evaluation method:<br/>Media projects will be evaluated based upon creative merit (40%), technical merit (40%), and meeting goals of the assignment (20%). Various writing assignments will be required. In addition, twenty percent of a student's grade will be based upon participation/professionalism.<br/><br/>Class materials:<br/>1 to 2 TB (size dependent on the amount of footage you are working with) portable hard drive required as well as an additional/reliable means to back up all your material.
