It seeks not only to familiarize you with ethnographic film traditions but also to problematize them. Thus, on occasions, both the canonical films and those that deconstruct them are examined. A number of significant film movements and auteurs, major approaches worldwide, and some of the salient theories, issues, and discourses about documentary and ethnographic films are examined. The works of French filmmaker Jean Rouch is highlighted as well as the works of direct cinema and cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9 filmmakers. The shifting and overlapping boundaries of fiction and nonfiction is also examined. <br/> <br/>The course has 3-4 required books and additional articles that are posted on the Canvas.
