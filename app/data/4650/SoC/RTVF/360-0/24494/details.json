Designed for playwrights at any level (beginning or advanced), the workshop's primary goals will be to develop a personal sense of what &quot;works&quot; on stage within the context of what's worked in the past, and to generate one rehearsal-ready ten minute play, and one short one act play, start to finish. <br/><br/>Learning objectives: acquiring a basic understanding of playwriting techniques and terms, and developing an ear and voice for the language and structures of the stage, with a focus on the short play. <br/><br/>Evaluation method: Class participation, completion of reading assignments, 2 plays (one ten minute, one short one act). <br/><br/>Class materials: 6 books:<br/><br/>Georg Buchner - Complete Plays, Lenz and Other Writings<br/>ISBN-10: 0140445862<br/>Penguin<br/><br/>Pornography, by Simon Stephens <br/>Series: Student Editions<br/>Publisher: Bloomsbury Methuen Drama (February 27, 2014)<br/>ISBN-10: 1408179857<br/><br/>Thom Paine (based on nothing), by Will Eno<br/>ISBN: 978-0-8222-2076-3<br/>Dramatists Play Service<br/><br/>A Number, by Caryl Churchill<br/>ISBN-10: 1559362251<br/>Theatre Communications Group (May 1, 2003)<br/><br/>Dutchman and The Slave: Two Plays, by LeRoi Jones<br/>ISBN-10: 0688210848<br/>Harper Perennial<br/><br/>Plays: Maria Irene Fornes<br/>ISBN-10: 0933826834<br/>Series: PAJ Books"}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "RTVF"}]
