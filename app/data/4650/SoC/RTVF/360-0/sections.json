Wallace told Bechdel that she would only see a movie if it satisfied three basic requirements. First, the movie had to have at least two women in it. Second, those two women had talk to each other. And third, that conversation had to be about something besides a man. These requirements have come to be known as the Bechdel-Wallace Test - a test which many films, television shows, and plays routinely fail. (In 2015, women accounted for only a third of speaking characters in films, and comprised only 22% of protagonists.) In this class we will aim to write scripts with leading roles for women - roles that are complicated, unique, and significant. We will do so by first examining traditional representations of women in all three media. We will then compare those representations to more contemporary portrayals and ask two essential questions: how far have we come in writing roles for women and how far do we have to go? The class will include screenings of films, televisions shows and readings of plays that co-opt genre (Meek's Crossing, Bridesmaids), challenge gender norms (Women Eating Salad Alone and Laughing), and expand traditional definitions of what it is to be a woman (Broad City, Girls, The Wolves, Orange is the New Black).
