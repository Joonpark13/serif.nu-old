Attention is paid to thematic concerns, characteristics of national cinemas, regional affinities, generic features, and authorial dimensions of a selected number of great films. <br/> <br/>The course also examines the historical, political, social, and ideological contexts of these films. It is designed to help cultivate understanding and appreciation both of local frameworks of knowledge in the non-Western postcolonial world, what used to be called the &quot;Third World,&quot; and of recent theoretical developments in film and media studies.
