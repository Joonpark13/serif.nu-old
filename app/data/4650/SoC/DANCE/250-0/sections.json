[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course will explore Modern Dance under the umbrella of Martha Graham, Katherine Dunham and Garth Fagan technique, some of the historical context from which it developed, and is currently performed. This Modern technique class will offer all the elements of a level II technique class through a historical lens and focus on the impact of these influential Modern Dance pioneers. Through the use of the floor, standing, across the floor sequences, students will explore more advanced dance etiquette, and terminology necessary to develop technique. The focus of this course is on developing flexibility, strength and stamina. Throughout this course we will explore the use of the back in order to gain a larger sense of the use of the torso/spine in modern dance. Students will also gain an understanding of the important contributions these choreographers, among others, have had on the development of modern dance. Complementary material such as videos and readings will be used in order to enhance the students experience in class.", "name": "Modern II", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "250-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SoC/DANCE/250-0/21920", "instructor": ["Erin Dawn Barnett"], "id": "21920", "subject": "DANCE"}, {"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This course will explore Modern Dance under the umbrella of Martha Graham, Katherine Dunham and Garth Fagan technique, some of the historical context from which it developed, and is currently performed.
