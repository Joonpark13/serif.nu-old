In particular, we explore using the syncopated rhythms of not only jazz but also rock-based music like funk and hip hop to generate all dance movement. The concept of full-bodied rhythm-making guides this goal. It involves, first, scat-singing the rhythms of the movement and, second, turning the extremities of the body - the hands, head, and feet - into &quot;drumbeaters&quot; that strike these rhythms against the &quot;drumheads&quot; of both the floor and the space around the body. <br/><br/>The alignment concept called Standing Down Straight\u00ae gives both stability and relaxation to the body as it makes rhythms. Rather than work from an uplifted posture and/or leg turn-out to achieve verticality, standing down straight grounds the body by letting the bones &quot;sit&quot; in response to the pull of gravity. From this loose and powerful base, high-energy, percussive rhythm-making can occur without causing strain or injury to the body."}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:47 PM (CT)", "subject": "DANCE"}]
