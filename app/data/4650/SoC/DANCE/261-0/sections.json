[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This jazz-rhythm-based dance course expands upon the beginning work covered in Jump Rhythm\u00ae Technique 1 (Dance 161): it continues to focus on dancing the actual rhythms of beat-driven music throughout the entire body. In particular, we explore using the syncopated rhythms of not only jazz but also rock-based music like funk and hip hop to generate all dance movement. The concept of full-bodied rhythm-making guides this goal. It involves, first, scat-singing the rhythms of the movement and, second, turning the extremities of the body - the hands, head, and feet - into \"drumbeaters\" that strike these rhythms against the \"drumheads\" of both the floor and the space around the body. <br/><br/>The alignment concept called Standing Down Straight\u00ae gives both stability and relaxation to the body as it makes rhythms. Rather than work from an uplifted posture and/or leg turn-out to achieve verticality, standing down straight grounds the body by letting the bones \"sit\" in response to the pull of gravity. From this loose and powerful base, high-energy, percussive rhythm-making can occur without causing strain or injury to the body.", "name": "Jump Rhythm Technique II", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "261-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SoC/DANCE/261-0/21933", "instructor": ["William Lewis   Siegenfeld"], "id": "21933", "subject": "DANCE"}]
