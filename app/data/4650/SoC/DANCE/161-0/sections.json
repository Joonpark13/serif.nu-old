[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This beginning level jazz dance course focuses on dancing rhythmically - using jazz rhythms and the syncopated rhythms of rock-based music like funk and hip hop to generate all dance movement. The concept of &quot;full-bodied rhythm-making&quot; guides this goal. It involves, first, singing the rhythms of the movement and, second, turning the extremities of the body - the hands, head, and feet - into &quot;drumbeaters&quot; that strike these rhythms against the &quot;drumheads&quot; of both the floor and the space around the body.<br/> <br/>The alignment concept called Standing Down Straight\u00ae gives both stability and relaxation to the body as it makes rhythms. Rather than work from an uplifted posture and/or leg turn-out to achieve verticality, standing down straight grounds the body by letting the bones &quot;sit&quot; in response to the pull of gravity. From this loose and powerful base, high-energy, percussive rhythm-making can occur without causing strain or injury to the body.", "name": "Jump Rhythm Technique 1", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "161-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SoC/DANCE/161-0/21932", "instructor": ["William Lewis   Siegenfeld"], "id": "21932", "subject": "DANCE"}]
