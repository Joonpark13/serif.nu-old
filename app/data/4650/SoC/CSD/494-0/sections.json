[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "Format<br/><br/>CSD 494 utilizes both lecture and active learning formats. Students are expected to prepare for (i.e., complete required readings and assignments) in order to participate actively in class discussions and activities. Every effort will be made by the course instructor and TA's to establish scholarly debates, especially on selected case studies. The format is intended to help students develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. For most lectures, visual and audio materials including PowerPoint slides, video and audio recordings will be used to enhance classroom learning. The reading load for the course is commensurate with graduate training. The required course readings and activities are designed to complement and to supplement information presented in the course lectures. <br/><br/>The course is designed to provide multiple formats for students to express their knowledge of the course content. Assignments, lectures, and course materials have been designed purposefully to link theoretical content from the course to clinical translation. The assignments for the course map directly onto the course learning objectives. While the intention of the course is to provide students with the theoretical foundation required for clinical practice in the areas of fluency and stuttering, students will demonstrate this knowledge in assignments and examinations based largely in clinically relevant tasks (e.g., case reports/summaries, mock clinical reports, designing therapy and assessment plans, designing and delivering individual and care partner education/training materials and plans, etc.). <br/><br/>Purpose <br/> This course will:<br/>? Provide an overview of potential etiologies and characteristics of fluency disorders in children and adults;<br/>? Focus on assessment, diagnosis, and effective treatment of stuttering across the<br/>? Lifespan;<br/>? Consider the experience of stuttering from the point of view of the person who stutters; and<br/>? Emphasize the integration of normative data, scientific knowledge, and clinical practice.", "name": "Fluency and Fluency Disorders", "section": "1", "location": "Frances Searle Building 1441", "topic": "", "course": "494-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SoC/CSD/494-0/25927", "instructor": ["Angela Christine Roberts"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "25927", "subject": "CSD"}]
