Students will learn to hear, transcribe using the International Phonetic Alphabet, and analyze speech sound production. Students will learn basic anatomy of the speech mechanism and how anatomic movement shapes sound production. They will learn conventions for coding differences in speech sound production within and across languages and learn to compare and contrast sound productions. They will be introduced to ways this knowledge can be used within a clinical setting.", "name": "Phonetics", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "305-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 2:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SoC/CSD/305-0/26058", "instructor": ["Judith L Oakley"], "id": "26058", "subject": "CSD"}]
