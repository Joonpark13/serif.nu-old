[{"school": "SoC", "overview_of_class": "This graduate course provides an overview of the multidisciplinary treatments required for patients with clefts and other craniofacial diagnoses, with an emphasis on the diagnosis and management of the speech and language disorders associated with those diagnoses. Individuals registering for this course should already be familiar with the anatomy and physiology of the vocal tract, allophonic transcription and phonological analyses of the speech of young children. Lectures are provided, but case reviews are consistently offered to stimulate discussion within and among the class students on the important diagnostic protocols and therapeutic interventions available for patients presenting for team care.", "name": "Craniofacial Anomalies and Syndromes", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "433-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:00PM - 9:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SoC/CSD/433-0/25923", "instructor": ["Mary   O'Gara"], "id": "25923", "subject": "CSD"}]
