In part, this course takes an historical approach and selectively examines past research in the field. Another component of this course includes selectively examining various topics, themes, issues, and concerns that have attracted attention from scholars in the past, and continue to attract attention today. Yet another component of this course selectively examines changes over time in scholarship related to Media, Technology, and Society: how ideas and interests of scholars can rise, can fade, and can be transformed.
