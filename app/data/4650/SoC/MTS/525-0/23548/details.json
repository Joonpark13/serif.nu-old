Does it make sense to speak of &quot;global culture&quot;? And if so, what role do the media and arts play in it, and how should we study related processes? Specifically, the goals of this course are three-fold: First, to provide an overview of theoretical key positions in the evolution of the &quot;global culture&quot; debate since its origins in international communication. Second, to acquaint with important current frontiers of research on media and the arts in global context. And third, by dissecting exemplary case studies, students also learn strategies to construct and pursue research problems that go beyond national borders. The course will involve brief lectures, student presentations, and discussions."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:46 PM (CT)", "subject": "MTS"}]
