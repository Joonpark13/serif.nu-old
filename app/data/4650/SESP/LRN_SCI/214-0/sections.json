[{"school": "SESP", "overview_of_class": "In this course, we will explore the cultural ground of cognition. How do cultural environments structure and orient our conceptual knowledge, and how do these cognitive processes feedback into cultural systems? Key topics include conceptual development, knowledge organization, causal reasoning, moral psychology, and environmental psychology. Jointly, the topics are integrated through a focus on social and ecological thought. We will engage in cultural artifact analyses, field experiences, and research inquiries. By the end of the course, you will have a deeper knowledge of concepts, culture, and their interaction, and you will be aware of the broader cultural frameworks that shape these very scientific inquiries. <br/><br/>Completion of an introductory course in the social and behavioral sciences (such as LOC 211-0 Introduction to Organization Theory and Practice or PSYCH 110 Introduction to Psychology) is a recommended prerequisite for this course. Students are expected to be comfortable reading and assessing journal articles, which requires some knowledge of statistics and research methods.", "name": "Culture and Cognition", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "214-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SESP/LRN_SCI/214-0/26262", "instructor": ["Bethany Lynn Ojalehto"], "id": "26262", "subject": "LRN_SCI"}]
