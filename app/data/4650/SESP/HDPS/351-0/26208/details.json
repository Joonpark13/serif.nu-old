What does it feel like to move through the adult years and toward &quot;old age&quot;? How do people's personalities, social relationships, and overall world view change as they grow older? What does psychological science have to say about general trends, as well as individual differences, in aging? This discussion-based seminar will consider a variety of psychological issues as they apply to adult development and aging, sampling some of the most provocative sources on this topic from fiction, drama, poetry, and cinema - and from the scientific literature."}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:48 PM (CT)", "subject": "HDPS"}]
