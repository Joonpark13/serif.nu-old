Each of these diverse topics will be overseen by a faculty member whose research is focused in that area. The instructor will introduce a given theme in the Monday class session. Although these sessions are designed to be didactic, they should ideally include a good bit of discussion as well. In preparation for each Friday session, students will be expected to read three to four assigned papers, a combination of classic and contemporary studies. The readings will be made available on Canvas and students will be expected to post several discussion questions for each paper to the class by Thursday. Although the instructor will guide the discussion on Friday, it should be driven primarily by the class. A student will be chosen randomly to introduce each paper. The class will assume a good background in the anatomy and physiology of the motor systems. Grading will be based on overall class participation and a short (3000-4000 words) paper due at the end of the quarter. Ideally it should combine insights from more than one session and contain several figures to illustrate key points."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:52 PM (CT)", "subject": "NUIN"}]
