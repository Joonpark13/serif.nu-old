[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Environmental problems have today become part and parcel of popular consciousness: resources are being depleted at a record pace, human population levels just crossed the seven billion threshold, extreme poverty defines the majority of people's daily lives, toxic contaminants affect all ecosystems, increasing numbers of species face extinction, consumerism and the commodification of nature show no signs of abating, and weapons and energy systems continue to proliferate that risk the planet's viability. This introductory lecture course is designed to help students understand the relatively recent origins of many of these problems, focusing especially on the last one hundred and fifty years. Students will have an opportunity to learn about the environmental effects of urbanization, industrialization, population growth, market economies, empire-building, intercontinental warfare, energy extraction, and new technologies. They will also explore different environmental philosophies and analytic frameworks that help us make sense of historical change, including political ecology, environmental history, science studies, and world history. Finally, the course will examine a range of transnational organizations, social movements, and state policies that have attempted to address and resolve environmental problems.", "name": "Global Environments and World History", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "340-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENVR_POL/340-0/27672", "instructor": ["Helen Louise Tilley"], "id": "27672", "subject": "ENVR_POL"}]
