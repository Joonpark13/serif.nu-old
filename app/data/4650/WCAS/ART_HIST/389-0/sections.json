[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "After the Mongol conquest of the Middle East in the 13th century, and the establishment of the Ilkhanid Dynasty, Islamic figurative painting changed in its subject matter and form. Encyclopedias of the natural world and historical treatises were illustrated for the first time in the Islamic lands. These paintings depict stories of biblical prophets, scenes from the life of the Buddha, the endeavors of Alexander the Great, and images of the Prophet Muhammad in narratives from the early days of Islam. They reflect an acquaintance with both Byzantine and East Asian art.<br/>The course discusses word and image in illustrated manuscripts that were produced from the turn of the 13th century until the end of the 15th century in the region of Iraq and Iran. Students will be introduced to poetry and prose composed in the Medieval Middle East in historical and religious contexts.", "name": "Special Topics: Arts of Asia and the Middle East", "section": "1", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-430", "topic": "History and Fantasy in Islamic Painting", "course": "389-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ART_HIST/389-0/21617", "instructor": ["Bilha   Moor"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "21617", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
