[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is a selective introduction to the artistic heritage of Asia, here broadly defined to include both the Indian subcontinent and East Asia (China, Korea, and Japan). We are primarily interested in how artists in each culture respond to the tasks of representing the other-/underworld?realms of gods, ghosts and &quot;goblins&quot;?on the one hand, the world of nature through painting and landscape design. Some of the questions we will address include: What are the conventions and limits of representing deities in art? How do artifacts and buildings that were fashioned from stone, timber, or paint solicit such devotion that their audiences could treat them as if they were immaterial? How do we understand different notions of naturalism in painting? Is faithfulness to what the eye can see the only measure of pictorial truth? Throughout this course, we will also consider the relationship between collecting and art history, how it gave rise to the practice of connoisseurship first as an avocation and later as a profession, how art collecting shaped and was shaped by changing notions of &quot;Asia,&quot; and finally, the challenges of studying artifacts that have been removed from their original contexts.", "name": "Introduction to Asian Art", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "240-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ART_HIST/240-0/21611", "instructor": ["Jun   Hu"], "id": "21611", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
