[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The course will study a wide range of developments in European art from the second half of the 1800s, a fabled era of innovation in painting, sculpture, urban transformation, architecture, printmaking, photography, and World's Fairs.\u00a0 The course will analyze art in light of a constellation of explanatory factors (&quot;causes&quot;): personal, aesthetic, technical, gender, social, ethnic, political, economic, and institutional. The primary focus will be the foremost vanguards (avant-gardes) of the era, individuals and groups who contested norms and authorities, but we will also consider competing forms of visual culture.\u00a0You can expect to study Realism (Gustave Courbet), Pre-Raphaelitism, Impressionism (Monet, Morisot, Cassatt, Renoir, Pissarro, Caillebotte and others), &quot;Post-Impressionism&quot; (Van Gogh, Seurat, Gauguin, C\u00e9zanne) and Symbolism. In the sphere of architecture and design, we will trace the impact of John Ruskin and William Morris, and you will see the work of, for example, Charles Garnier (architect of the Paris Op\u00e9ra) and Viollet-le-Duc, and continuing in the Art Nouveau designs of Hector Guimard and Henri Van de Velde, followed by Otto Wagner and Adolph Loos, Auguste Perret and Tony Garnier, Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. Because of the cultural authority of Paris in these years, French art and architecture will claim most of our time, but the entanglements of France with cultures and nations beyond France will figure prominently.", "name": "19Th Century Art", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "350-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ART_HIST/350-2/21615", "instructor": ["David T Van Zanten", "Susan Hollis   Clayson", "Stephen F Eisenman"], "id": "21615", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
