The primary focus will be the foremost vanguards (avant-gardes) of the era, individuals and groups who contested norms and authorities, but we will also consider competing forms of visual culture.\u00a0You can expect to study Realism (Gustave Courbet), Pre-Raphaelitism, Impressionism (Monet, Morisot, Cassatt, Renoir, Pissarro, Caillebotte and others), &quot;Post-Impressionism&quot; (Van Gogh, Seurat, Gauguin, C\u00e9zanne) and Symbolism. In the sphere of architecture and design, we will trace the impact of John Ruskin and William Morris, and you will see the work of, for example, Charles Garnier (architect of the Paris Op\u00e9ra) and Viollet-le-Duc, and continuing in the Art Nouveau designs of Hector Guimard and Henri Van de Velde, followed by Otto Wagner and Adolph Loos, Auguste Perret and Tony Garnier, Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. Because of the cultural authority of Paris in these years, French art and architecture will claim most of our time, but the entanglements of France with cultures and nations beyond France will figure prominently."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "One midterm exam, class discussion participation when possible, a museum-based analysis paper and a final exam."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "value": "PDFs of all readings will be posted on Canvas."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:53 PM (CT)", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
