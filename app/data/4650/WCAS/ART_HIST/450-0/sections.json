[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The seminar will investigate a wide array of visual art practices in the transatlantic world - from the 1830s (birth of Morse Code, telegraphy and photography) through the 1940s (WW2 and its aftermath) - that have imaged or in other ways referenced technology. A central question will be this: does a demonstrably technological or machinic iconography express an opinion on technology? Among the sources of artistic inspiration under scrutiny will be telegraphy, the railway, electricity-powered devices including lighting, construction equipment, the airplane, machines of war, high-tech architecture, and the automobile. The seminar will also investigate intermedial art forms whose production is technologized, e.g. intaglio printmaking. <br/> Image: Francis Picabia, This Thing is Made to Perpetuate my Memory, 1915", "name": "Studies in 19th Century Art", "section": "1", "topic": "Art and Technology", "course": "450-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ART_HIST/450-0/21637", "instructor": ["Susan Hollis   Clayson"], "id": "21637", "subject": "ART_HIST"}]
