A central question will be this: does a demonstrably technological or machinic iconography express an opinion on technology? Among the sources of artistic inspiration under scrutiny will be telegraphy, the railway, electricity-powered devices including lighting, construction equipment, the airplane, machines of war, high-tech architecture, and the automobile. The seminar will also investigate intermedial art forms whose production is technologized, e.g. intaglio printmaking. <br/> Image: Francis Picabia, This Thing is Made to Perpetuate my Memory, 1915", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "Studies in 19th Century Art", "title": "WCAS ART_HIST 450-0-1 Studies in 19th Century Art", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:41 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Susan Hollis   Clayson", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "Art and Technology", "course": "450-0", "enrl_requirement": "<br/>Add Consent: Department Consent Required<br/>", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "The seminar will investigate a wide array of visual art practices in the transatlantic world - from the 1830s (birth of Morse Code, telegraphy and photography) through the 1940s (WW2 and its aftermath) - that have imaged or in other ways referenced technology.
