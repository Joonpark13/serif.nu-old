[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course explores prosody in spoken language, examining how pitch melodies and the temporal patterning of speech are used to convey structure and meaning above the level of the word. Prosodic patterns will be examined in diverse languages where prosody functions variously to structure words into phonological phrases, to mark the information status of words and phrases in discourse, and in structuring dialogue interactions among conversational partners. Evolutionary and developmental links between linguistic and emotional prosody will also be considered. The course will address prosody from theoretical and empirical perspectives, in terms of symbolic representations and in the acoustic patterning of pitch, duration, and other measures.", "name": "Laboratory Phonology I", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "450-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/LING/450-1/20583", "instructor": ["Jennifer Sandra Cole"], "id": "20583", "subject": "LING"}]
