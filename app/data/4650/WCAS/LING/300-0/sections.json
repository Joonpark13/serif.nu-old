[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will explore how experimental methods from a variety of areas (speech perception, social psychology, and psycholinguistics) can help us examine new and exciting questions about the social meaning of language. We will begin by discussing current theoretical work on socially meaningful linguistic variation, finding research questions that are suited to the use of experimental methods. We will then turn to the growing body of experimental research in sociolinguistics to understand the theoretical and methodological contributions of this work. Using prior work as a jumping off point, we will discuss questions such as: How do our social experiences, stereotypes, and attitudes mediate how we speak and how we listen? How do we infer who someone is from the way that they speak? How do our social expectations influence our linguistic perceptions? And how much control do we have over these processes? Students will gain both a theoretical understanding of research in these areas, as well as practical knowledge related to formulating research questions and constructing experimental studies on sociolinguistic topics.", "name": "Topics in Linguistics", "section": "22", "topic": "", "course": "300-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/LING/300-0/20567", "instructor": ["Annette Kumsun D'onofrio"], "id": "20567", "subject": "LING"}]
