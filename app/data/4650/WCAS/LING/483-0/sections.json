[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, online speech training software provides customized training for the purpose of increasing nonnative speakers' intelligibility in oral English. At the beginning of the term, students will complete an online assessment to establish a baseline of oral proficiency. The software will generate a customized course of study that provides appropriate practice in each session to help the student acquire the language and skills needed to improve intelligibility. Students will be expected to maintain milestones of usage each week during the quarter, and will have access to both periodic and end-of-quarter feedback on their progress. Students will be asked to reflect on their own learning at the end of the term. Active participation and evidence of progress towards improved proficiency must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in the course.", "name": "NativeAccent Speech Training for Nonnative Speakers of English", "section": "20", "location": "TBA", "topic": "", "course": "483-0", "meeting_time": ["TBA"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/LING/483-0/20604", "instructor": ["Julia Margaret Moore", "Jennifer Alexandra Alexander"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "20604", "subject": "LING"}]
