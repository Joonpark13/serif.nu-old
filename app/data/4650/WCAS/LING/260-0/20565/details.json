We will analyze data from a variety of languages (including English), focusing on the differences among morphological and syntactic systems, but also on the generalizations that can be made about all languages. The focus of this class is on formal (structural) aspects of language rather than on its social aspects. For this reason, it satisfies the WCAS Area II (Formal Studies) Distribution Requirement."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "None"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Acquiring basic analytical tools in syntax and morphology.
