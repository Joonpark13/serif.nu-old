Course content will concentrate on improving methods of designing and delivering oral presentations to audiences using visual aids. Over the course of the class, students will have opportunities to improve their presentation design and delivery in English through the observation, creation, peer-evaluation, and practice of short academic presentations. In so doing, students will develop skills in visual design fundamentals; oral communication strategies; audience awareness and engagement; and English vocabulary frequently used in academic presentations. This course is designed to give students confidence and experience that is transferable to a variety of academic contexts, including class presentations, research reports, job interviews, conference presentations, and teaching and/or leading class discussion sections. Active participation and evidence of progress towards proficiency must be demonstrated in order to achieve a satisfactory grade in this course."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Instructor consent required"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "By the end of this course, students should be able to:<br/> <br/>1. Identify personal strengths and weaknesses in their communicative competence in American English (i.e. linguistic competence, sociolinguistic competence, discourse competence, functional competence, and strategic competence) from the use of data from self-assessments and instructor feedback.<br/>2. Demonstrate progress toward proficiency in using English for academic purposes, e.g.,<br/>a. Improve verbal communication skills required for academic presentations in both casual settings (e.g., office-hours consultations) and formal settings (e.g., job talks)<br/>b. Improve written communication skills required for academic presentations, e.g., organization and composition of posters, slides, and handouts. <br/>c. Utilize various skills required for clear and effective communication across these modalities, e.g., use of conjunctions for smooth flow of verbal and/or written ideas; appropriate use of focus and emphasis in exposition; strategies for responding to questions<br/>d. Identify and employ different strategies needed for successful communication in different situations, e.g., understanding differences between formal and casual register and terms of address; use of acronyms and jargon for expert audiences vs. plain English for lay audiences<br/>3.
