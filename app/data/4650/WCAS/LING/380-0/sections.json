Course content will concentrate on improving methods of designing and delivering oral presentations to audiences using visual aids. Over the course of the class, students will have opportunities to improve their presentation design and delivery in English through the observation, creation, peer-evaluation, and practice of short academic presentations. In so doing, students will develop skills in visual design fundamentals; oral communication strategies; audience awareness and engagement; and English vocabulary frequently used in academic presentations. This course is designed to give students confidence and experience that is transferable to a variety of academic contexts, including class presentations, research reports, job interviews, conference presentations, and teaching and/or leading class discussion sections.
