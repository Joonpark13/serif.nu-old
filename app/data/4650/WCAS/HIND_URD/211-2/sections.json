[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Like many other languages, the Hindi-Urdu language spoken daily at home or in the street varies rather dramatically from its more formal version used by the media (print or RTV). In this course we will take a look at a range of topics in different kinds of media, and learn how to understand the longer sentences and the vocabulary that draws heavily either on the Sanskrit, or the Persian/Arabic roots. We will look at local, national (US, India and Pakistan) and international news. We may compare some related articles in Hindi-Urdu and English and see how some terms are translated into Hindi-Urdu. We will also follow up on some news. <br/><br/>We will spend about a week and half on each of the proposed topics: <br/>a. Politics<br/>b. Weather and Environment<br/>c. Peace/War/Terrorism<br/>d. Social issues<br/>e. Sports<br/>f.
