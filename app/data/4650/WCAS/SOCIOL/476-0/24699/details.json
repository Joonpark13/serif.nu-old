However, attention to the particular dimension of class has grown dramatically in recent years, both in sociology and in other social science disciplines. In this seminar, we take an interdisciplinary approach and integrate this newer focus on class with ongoing research on other dimensions of inequality. We also focus on the role of politics - broadly construed to include systems of beliefs and ideology, culture, electoral systems, social movements, states - in creating, sustaining or eroding inequalities of various kinds."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "This course is on Department Consent.
