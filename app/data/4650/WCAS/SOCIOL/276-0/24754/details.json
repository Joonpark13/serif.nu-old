Why does a choice made to slow typing down still affect our modern laptops? This course approaches the study of sociological institutions from a unique perspective: understanding how these institutions emerge and address existing societal problems. We focus on both coordination-type dilemmas: how to parent, best approaches to marketing and collective-action dilemmas: how to police fishermen going over quota, farmers reining in downstream pollution. We end with a study of how institutions persist, possibly beyond their useful lifespan, such as the persistence of the intentionally inefficient `QWERTY' keyboard and its application to health care."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "One required book: American Society, How It Really Works, 2nd edition.
