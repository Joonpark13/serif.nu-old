[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This class investigates modernity. It includes selections that illustrate how various thinkers have conceived of what it means to \"be modern\" or \"post-modern,\" critiques of modernity that have profoundly shaped our images of it, and skeptics who challenge the idea of modernity. It also includes sections that investigate in detail what I call \"mechanisms\" of modernity: procedures, devices, approaches or strategies that people adopt or promulgate in their efforts to be rational, manage uncertainty and conflict, or attain efficiency in various institutional arenas. Readings will include works by Michel Foucault, Larraine Daston, Anthony Giddens, Bruno Latour, Jurgen Habermas, James Scott and Ted Porter, among others.", "name": "Modern Theory in Sociological Analysis", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 318", "topic": "", "course": "406-2", "meeting_time": ["We 11:00AM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/SOCIOL/406-2/24698", "instructor": ["Wendy N Espeland"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "24698", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
