This class studies the most powerful feeling of political loyalty: nationalism. Over the last centuries nationalism has been implicated in insurgencies, resistance, the destruction of empires, warfare, voting, populist mobilization and riots. In the first section of this course students will be introduced to theories that try to answer two sets of questions 1) Where do national identities come from? 2) When, why and how do national groups mobilize? In the second part of this course, we will assess the validity of different explanations through the comparative study of seven particular cases of nationalist mobilization: the rise of nationalism in Germany, resistance during World War Two, the fall of the Soviet union, the split of Yugoslavia, electoral violence in India, ethnic voting in Malawi and xenophobic movements in the United States. Students will explore an eighth case independently. For their own research students choose one specific geographical area (a country, a border region of two countries or other sub-national regions) at a particular point in time and explain 1) how the inhabitants of that territory came to acquire national identities, 2) how the boundaries of the group are constituted 3) why and how these identities did or did not get mobilized.", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "Social Protest and Social Change", "title": "WCAS SOCIOL 334-0-20 Social Protest and Social Change", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:48 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Robert   Braun", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "334-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Why do people vote, fight, kill and die for their nation?
