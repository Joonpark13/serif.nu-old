[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines a variety of topics relating to crime and the social scientific study of crime, or criminology. Using a wide range of in-class media and interactive activities, we will explore research investigating the effects of crime and what it means to be a criminal. After a brief overview of the field, we will examine criminological and sociological research on the different stages of the criminal justice system (policing, courts, and prisons) before turning our focus to a few specific substantive areas of research, such as capital punishment, gangs, and crime as depicted in pop culture. As with all first-year seminars, writing and in-class participation will be the core requirements", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L05", "topic": "Crime and Criminology.", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/SOCIOL/101-6/24656", "instructor": ["Zachary Graham Sommers"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>Freshmen/Sophomores Only<br/><br/>", "id": "24656", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
