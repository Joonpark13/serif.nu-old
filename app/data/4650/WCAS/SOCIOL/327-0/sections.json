[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The course will be a critical examination of how \"childhood\" and \"adolescence\" have been defined in the U.S. We will consider how modern and historical conceptions of childhood and adolescence have evolved and how these definitions have been shaped by societal forces and institutions such as the economy, religion, and politics. We will also look at the lives of children themselves and how individuals experience being children, kids, teens, and so forth in a particular time and place.<br/><br/>As a class, we will also be very critical of cultural and media portrayals of children and teenagers and ask how these representations have reflected and shaped how society views youth. We will also look at how childhood itself has been viewed as a social problem. Children and adolescents and their behavior have often been considered to be the root of many social concerns (such as teen pregnancy, suicide, and bullying). But also many social problems arise because of society's feeling that children and young people need to be protected (such as calls to end child labor and the \"missing child\" awareness movement). <br/><br/>The final topic for the course will be how adolescents make the transition to adulthood socially, emotionally, and economically, and how this transition has changed over time - particularly over the last several decades.", "name": "Youth and Society", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G21", "topic": "", "course": "327-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/SOCIOL/327-0/27576", "instructor": ["Karrie A Snyder"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "27576", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
