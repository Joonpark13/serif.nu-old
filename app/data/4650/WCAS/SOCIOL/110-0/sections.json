[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Sociology emerges from the hunch that there are forces at work beyond our control (and often beyond our awareness) that influence how we think, feel, and act. Sociologists have turned this philosophical speculation into a systematic approach to building and testing theories. Sociological explanations center on the structure and dynamics of social groups (families, friendship networks, organizations, etc.) as enabling and constraining human behavior. In this course, you will learn to think like a sociologist - to use your &quot;sociological imagination&quot; to examine the social nature of a number of issues and behaviors, many of which may at first appear to be the results of strictly individual motives and personal choices. You will get a broad overview of the theories and methods used in sociology and how these are applied across a wide range of important phenomena, including gender, race, inequality, and education.", "name": "Introduction to Sociology", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "110-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/SOCIOL/110-0/24657", "instructor": ["Craig Michael Rawlings"], "id": "24657", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
