[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines global migration from a sociological lens, paying particular attention to migration to the United States and Western Europe. We will explore how the social, political, and historical contexts of sending and receiving nations shape migration patterns, as well as the relationships between migrants and existing institutions and identities. The first part of the course will focus on understanding migration patterns, outlining the factors and policies that have shaped migration across time and space. Following this, we explore questions and debates about immigrant assimilation and incorporation, considering how factors such as gender, race, ethnicity, and religion, affect the reception and integration of migrants. Finally, we will examine the consequences of immigration and transnationalism on nation-states and diasporic communities.", "name": "Sociology of Immigration", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "322-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/SOCIOL/322-0/24752", "instructor": ["Diego Felipe De Los Rios"], "id": "24752", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
