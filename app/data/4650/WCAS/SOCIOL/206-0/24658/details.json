We focus on several of the most important sociological questions about law including: 1) What is the purpose of law in a modern society? 2) How is the legal system and legal profession organized? 3) How does politics shape the law? 4) What does the law look like in action? And 5) how can law create or constrain social change? In order to explore these questions, it focuses on a few legal issues in modern U.S. society, including same-sex marriage and race and gender discrimination. It also introduces research methods for the study of law and society."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation, response papers, midterm and final exam."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "If you would like Ann to order your books through Norris, and/or you would like her to order desk copies, be sure to provide all of the following information for each book: Author, Publisher, Title, Edition/Year, ISBN #, Paperback/Hardcover, # of Desk Copies Needed<br/><br/>Kitty Calavita, Invitation to Law &amp; Society: An Introduction to the Study of Real Law (University of Chicago Press, 2010), 1st edition, ISBN-10: 0226089975 <br/><br/>ResponseWare https://store.turningtechnologies.com/"}], "lmod": "12/29/16 7:05 PM (CT)", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
