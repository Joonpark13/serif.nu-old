We will examine the interactions of plants with other groups of organisms, such as with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and ant &quot;bodyguards&quot;, and how plants play a fundamental role in the ecosystem. We will also discuss adaptations that plant groups have evolved for living in extreme environments, including desert and aquatic habitats, as well as adaptations in carnivorous, parasitic, and epiphytic plants."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Written midterm and final examinations; quizzes; preparation for and participation in discussions."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Instructor will provide required materials."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "value": "The Nature of Plants, 2005, J.
