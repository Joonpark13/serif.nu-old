[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course we will learn about biological processes by studying how plants make and store food, reproduce, defend themselves, and colonize new areas. We will examine the interactions of plants with other groups of organisms, such as with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and ant &quot;bodyguards&quot;, and how plants play a fundamental role in the ecosystem. We will also discuss adaptations that plant groups have evolved for living in extreme environments, including desert and aquatic habitats, as well as adaptations in carnivorous, parasitic, and epiphytic plants.", "name": "The Nature of Plants", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "109-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/109-0/21282", "instructor": ["Paul James Caradonna"], "id": "21282", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
