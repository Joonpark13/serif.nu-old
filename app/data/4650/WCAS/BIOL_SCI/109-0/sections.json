We will also discuss adaptations that plant groups have evolved for living in extreme environments, including desert and aquatic habitats, as well as adaptations in carnivorous, parasitic, and epiphytic plants.", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "The Nature of Plants", "title": "WCAS BIOL_SCI 109-0-1 The Nature of Plants", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:41 PM (CT)", "section": "1", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Paul James Caradonna", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "109-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "In this course we will learn about biological processes by studying how plants make and store food, reproduce, defend themselves, and colonize new areas.
