The course analyzes the molecular mechanisms that control developmental processes and the mechanisms underlying the changes in body plans that have occurred over the course of evolution, with an emphasis on the experimental strategies employed in studying these mechanisms. Specific topics include formation of the body axes, development of the nervous system, cell-cell signalling, stem cell potency and cloning. Course includes an extended session on Fridays in which original literature is discussed and a special topic is explored in depth in order to better emphasize key signal transduction pathways involved in the control of pattern, cell fate specification and cell behavior."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites: Biol Sci 215, 217, 219, and 308."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and one-half hour per week optional discussion section."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Weekly homework, papers as assigned, Midterm and Final."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "REQUIRED textbook is &quot;Principles of Development&quot; by Wolpert, 4th Edition (2010), Oxford University Press, ISBN# 978-0-1995-5428-7; Papers as assigned."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "value": "The following textbooks are Recommended: &quot;Molecular Biology of the Cell&quot; by Alberts, 5th Edition (2008), Garland Taylor Publishers, ISBN# 0-8153-4105-9 <br/><br/>AND<br/><br/>&quot;Developmental Biology&quot; by Gilbert, 9th Edition, Sinauer Publishers, ISBN# 978-0-87893-384-6"}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
