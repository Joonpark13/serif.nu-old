[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "From stem cells and cloning to cancer biology and evolution, developmental biology is central to many of the most exciting questions in modern molecular biology. The course analyzes the molecular mechanisms that control developmental processes and the mechanisms underlying the changes in body plans that have occurred over the course of evolution, with an emphasis on the experimental strategies employed in studying these mechanisms. Specific topics include formation of the body axes, development of the nervous system, cell-cell signalling, stem cell potency and cloning. Course includes an extended session on Fridays in which original literature is discussed and a special topic is explored in depth in order to better emphasize key signal transduction pathways involved in the control of pattern, cell fate specification and cell behavior.", "name": "Development and Evolution of Body Plans", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute M152", "topic": "", "course": "391-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 12:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/391-0/21163", "instructor": ["Carole B LaBonne"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "21163", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
