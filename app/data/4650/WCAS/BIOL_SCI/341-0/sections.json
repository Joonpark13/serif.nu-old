[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Change in the genetic composition of populations over time is the basis of evolution. The field of population genetics describes this genetic change, both as replacement of genes within populations, and as diversification among populations which can become species. This course reviews the dynamics of genetic variation in populations through evidence from natural history, experimentation, and theory. Topics include: natural selection, genetic drift, inbreeding, mutation, and geographic structure of populations, based on single-locus models, molecular sequences, and quantitative traits. More specialized topics such as sexual selection, kin and group selection, and the evolution of sexual reproduction and recombination will be included as time allows.", "name": "Population Genetics", "section": "20", "location": "Tech Institute Lecture Room 4", "topic": "", "course": "341-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 4:00PM - 5:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/341-0/21309", "instructor": ["Joseph S Walsh"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "21309", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
