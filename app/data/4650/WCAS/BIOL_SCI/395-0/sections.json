[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Recent advances in genetics and molecular biology have revolutionized the fields of gene expression, cell regulation and functional genomics. These ad advances have fundamentally changed not only our basic understanding in these areas but how we make discoveries. We will explore this revolution directly through the primary research literature. The required reading material will be provided and will consist of several classic papers as well as a larger number of recent papers from the most highly respected research journals. Representative topics will include how genes are manipulated, how gene expression is regulated in vivo, how molecular/genetic analysis of model organisms such as yeast is used to advance understanding in higher organisms, how human disease genes are discovered and a how every gene in an entire genome can be analyzed simultaneously. We will delve deeply into two of the hottest fields in molecular genetics today: epigenetics (chromatin modification and its consequences) and recently developed methods that allow rapid and simple engineering of the genome of almost any organism. Although lectures are provided, the class is small enough to allow students to take an active role through questions and discussion.", "name": "Molecular Genetics", "section": "20", "location": "Frances Searle Building 2378", "topic": "", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 2:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/395-0/21164", "instructor": ["Richard F Gaber"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>Seniors Only<br/><br/>", "id": "21164", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
