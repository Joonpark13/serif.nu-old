[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The diverse functions of the nervous system depend on precise wiring of connections between neurons. This course will cover cellular and molecular processes of how neuronal connections are established during development, including the role of activity-dependent plasticity. Diseases resulting from failures of these processes will be discussed. This course will also introduce research methods and technology, and encourage students to develop skills to appreciate historical context and logical rationale of contemporary research.", "name": "Developmental Neurobiology", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "304-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/304-0/21157", "instructor": ["Jianhua   Cang"], "id": "21157", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
