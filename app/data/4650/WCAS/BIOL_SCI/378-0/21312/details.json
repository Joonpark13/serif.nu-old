At its core, the goal of genomics is to generate a detailed map of an organism's genome that includes the location and identity of every gene. However, the field of genomics is becoming increasingly broad, often focusing on the questions and analyses that arise once a genome has been sequenced and described. The methods developed by the Human Genome Project, both from a sequencing and analysis perspective, significantly altered the landscape of human research, both from a biomedical and from an evolutionary standpoint. Building on these methods and on very recent advances in DNA sequencing technology, genomics is no longer limited to the study of humans; genome research can now being applied to any organism from jellyfish to polar bear, from mold to palm trees. In this class we will discuss how and why we sequence genomes, how we analyze their content (including a hands-on approach), and how the understanding of genomes from across the entire tree of life (i.e., comparative genomics) can illuminate fundamental questions in biology."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites: BIO 210-3 or BIO 215 and 216; a course in statistics"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture, Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Exams - 50%<br/>Papers - 25%<br/>Projects - 20%<br/>Class Participation - 5%"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "A Primer of Genome Science, third edition, Greg Gibson and Spencer V.
