[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an introduction to the diversity and evolutionary history of land plants for advanced undergraduates and graduate students. It will introduce principles of plant structure, classification, phylogeny, and paleontology in an evolutionary framework. Morphological, anatomical, molecular and fossil evidence for the evolutionary history and relationships of each group will be presented. Laboratories will focus on diversity and structural characteristics of each group and their fossils.<br/>Field trips will complement lecture and laboratory activities. In addition to lecture and lab, students will prepare an annotated bibliography on a topic of their choosing (subject to approval).", "name": "Plant Evolution and Diversity Lab", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute LG72", "topic": "", "course": "350-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 10:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/BIOL_SCI/350-0/21310", "instructor": ["Patrick S Herendeen"], "class_attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description<br/><br/>", "id": "21310", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
