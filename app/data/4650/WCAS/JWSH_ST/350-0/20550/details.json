Working as a small group, we will examine artistic and ethical questions about representing the reality of the Holocaust and questions about how we make meaning from its horrific events and the roles of memory, language, and history. Because of the painful nature of the material, the course emphasizes small group work. Discussion and writing assignments will encourage students to share their responses so that we begin to understand different portrayals of victimization and survival as well as relationships between ourselves and our readings and films. Course readings and Professor Lassner supply the historical contexts necessary to approach our subject."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "How to analyze and interpret many creative and critical forms of Holocaust representation."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Mostly discussion of readings and films, with occasional short lectures."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Attendance: 25%<br/>Paper, final: 40%<br/>Paper, mid-term: 35%<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Doris Bergen.
