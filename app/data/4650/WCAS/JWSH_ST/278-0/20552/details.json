We will ask: What is the role of literature in political conflict, and in a state of war? Students will not only learn about the historical context of Israeli literature post-1948, but will be introduced to the meta-literary questions of political discourse and minor literature. We will problematize notions of national narrative and national literature, discussing and analyzing the main issues with which this literature engages, such as the national subject, gender, self and other, identity and counter identity. We will read texts from a variety of times and contexts written by, inter alia: S. Yizhar, Amos Oz and Dalia Ravikovitch. In addition, the course will introduce the case of Palestinian authors writing in Hebrew, through texts by Anton Shammas, Salman Masalha and Sayed Kashua."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "None"}], "lmod": "12/29/16 7:01 PM (CT)", "subject": "JWSH_ST"}]
