As in many other places with leaders determined to modernize quickly, the prewar Japanese government systematically stripped the countryside of resources in order to build and display the central institutions of a modern nation, most of which were in the cities. These developments recast Tokyo as the epitome of Japan's modern success in economic and political terms and as the site of its cultural and social disintegration. Tokyo and nearly all Japanese cities then were virtually leveled during World War II. After the war, the newly reconstructed cities became the central arenas for Japanese efforts to create democracy. <br/><br/>This co-taught course examines the cultural representations of the modern Japanese city from its construction to its destruction and then regeneration. We will study the ways Japanese transformed Tokyo into an imperial capital and then recast it as a space for new forms of political and social relationships after the war. Throughout its history, Tokyo has been Japan's central site for defining and redefining class and gender identities as well as participating in mass consumption. We will consider how authors and filmmakers represented individual and collective experiences of urban life and the ways that urban space shaped the very form and possibilities of life in modern Japan."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lectures and Discussion. <br/>A special feature will be an exhibit at the Chicago Art Institute and a film program at the Block Museum"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Attendance and Participation - Lecture &amp; Section (15%)<br/>Short Paper A - Visualization of Urban Space (20%)<br/>Short Paper B - Representation of Tokyo in Literature (20%)<br/>Short Paper C - Photography Exhibit or Experimental Films (20%)<br/>Final Paper (25%)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "E.
