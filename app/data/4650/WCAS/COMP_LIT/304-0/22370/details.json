How can we recognize present-day realities in its surreal cinematic assault on the senses? As interlocking narratives of globalization, resource competition, and ecological crisis collide in the news, the vital natural resources on which human lives and relationships depend have increasingly taken center stage in recent fiction and film. Whether it's a question of &quot;too much&quot; or &quot;not enough&quot; - of deluge or scarcity - the tales we will read and watch together in this course bring us in close to &quot;resource wars&quot; and utopian (or dystopian) imaginaries, so that we can see them through every day, intimate encounters. Each zooms in, in other words, from geopolitical power struggles over problems caused by oil and water, to their effects on a human scale - often to remind us that this is the scale where our actions count. Mixing fast-paced action, futuristic sci-fi, devastating satire, and surreal beauty, these works cannot be captured by a single mood, and they likewise resist being reduced to explanations of history and policy, or &quot;dry&quot; questions of drilling and water rights. Our discussions of the novels and films for the course will instead be guided by how each represents pressing problems of competition and coexistence."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Brief lectures, seminar-style discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Classroom participation, short writing assignments, two papers."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Amitav Ghosh, The Hungry Tide; Ursula Le Guin, The Dispossessed; Helon Habila, Oil on Water;<br/>Paolo Bacigalupi, The Water Knife;<br/>Short writings by Henry David Thoreau, Mary Austin, Arthur Conan Doyle, John Berger, Italo Calvino, Elizabeth Bishop, and Alexei Parshchikov.<br/> <br/>Films may include: Roman Polanski, Chinatown; David O.
