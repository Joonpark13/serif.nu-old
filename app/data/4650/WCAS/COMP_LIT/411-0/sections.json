[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course provides an introduction to the philosophy of Giorgio Agamben, particularly the texts that he includes within the Homo Sacer cycle. We discuss the genealogy and influence of the pivotal concepts that he espouses such as homo sacer, bare life, and the state of exception. These notions have generated both vital interest and vehement controversies that seem likely to endure for quite some time.\u00a0 For example, does the notion of homo sacer help or hinder us from assessing the critical implications of the current global refugee crisis? Through such question, we examine the advantages and limits of Agamben's thought for contemporary discussions of biopolitics, political philosophy, the Shoah, and postcolonial studies. Finally, by considering Agamben's encounters with figures such as Melville, Kafka, and Levi, we ask whether his literary readings offer a more productive horizon than does the rest of his thought. <br/><br/>Over the course of the term, we will cover texts by Agamben, Foucault, Schmitt, Benjamin, Butler, Levi, Kafka, and Melville.<br/>\u00a0", "name": "Critical Practices", "section": "20", "topic": "Agamben", "course": "411-0", "meeting_time": ["We 4:00PM - 6:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/COMP_LIT/411-0/22362", "instructor": ["Alessia   Ricciardi"], "id": "22362", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
