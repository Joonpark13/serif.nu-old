[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "We tend to take the ways in which we express and experience love for granted, yet love?like most human activities?is culturally conditioned and contextually determined. In this course, we will read and discuss erotic poems stemming from four cultures widely different from ours?Ancient Egypt, Israel, Greece, and Rome?, including texts as different as the Biblical Song of Songs, homoerotic poems sung at drinking parties in ancient Athens, and sophisticated love elegies addressed to mysterious and probably fictional Roman addressees. Topics to be considered include the representation of male and female bodies, the construction of gender roles, desire and sexuality, and the language and poetic images associated with love.", "name": "Reading World Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 111", "topic": "Ways of Love in Antiquity", "course": "201-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/COMP_LIT/201-0/22363", "instructor": ["Marianne I Hopman"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "22363", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
