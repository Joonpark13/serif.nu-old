The experience of poetry includes both of these models, and theories of poetry from antiquity to the present day have grappled with these two dimensions of the poetic experience. In order to understand a poem, a reader must, in some sense, enter into its unique and complex logic, while nevertheless remaining open to the sometimes unsettling ways it can surprise us. In this class, we will read some of the greatest lyric poems written in English, as we systematically develop an understanding of the formal techniques of poetic composition, including diction, syntax, image, trope, and rhythm. Students should come prepared to encounter poems as new and unfamiliar terrain (even if you've read a particular poem before), as we methodically work through the formal elements of the poetic process."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Lectures and required weekly discussion sections"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "LectureLecture and discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Weekly reading exercises; two 5-7 page papers; final project; final exam."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Ferguson, Salter and Stallworthy, eds.
