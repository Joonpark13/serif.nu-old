The focus will be on four volumes of the Search: Swann's Way, Within a Budding Grove, Sodom and Gomorrah, and Time Regained. We will explore Proust's reinvention of the novel as a form in relation to a number of Proustian problems and themes: his analyses of desire, perversion and sexuality; his reflections on the nature of time and memory; and his exploration of the relationship of art to life. We will also consider Proust's powers as a satirist and critic of ideology, who mercilessly dismantled the individual and collective illusions of his contemporaries."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "The focus will be on four volumes of the Search: Swann's Way, Within a Budding Grove, Sodom and Gomorrah, and Time Regained."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "This class is combined with FRENCH 374 &quot;Proust&quot;"}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:57 PM (CT)", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
