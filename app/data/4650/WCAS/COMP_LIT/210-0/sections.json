[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is intended to familiarize literary students with the most influential text in Western culture. No previous acquaintance with the Bible is presupposed. We will consider such questions as the variety of literary genres and strategies in the Bible; the historical situation of its writers; the representation of God as a literary character; the Bible as a national epic; the New Testament as a radical reinterpretation of the \"Old Testament\" (or Hebrew Bible); and the overall narrative as a plot with beginning, middle, and end. Since time will not permit a complete reading of the Bible, we will concentrate on those books that display the greatest literary interest and/or historical influence: Genesis, Exodus, Ruth, Job, selected Psalms, Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Isaiah; the Gospels according to Matthew and John, and the Book of Revelation (Apocalypse). We will look more briefly at traditional strategies of interpretation, such as midrash, allegory, and harmonization, and at the processes that went into the construction of the Biblical canon.", "name": "The Bible As Literature", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "210-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 12:00PM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/COMP_LIT/210-0/22343", "instructor": ["Regina M Schwartz"], "id": "22343", "subject": "COMP_LIT"}]
