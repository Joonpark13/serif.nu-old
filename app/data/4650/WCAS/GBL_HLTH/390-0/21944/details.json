The W.K. Kellogg Foundation states CBPR is a collaborative research approach that &quot;begins with a research topic of importance to the community and has the aim of combining knowledge with action and achieving social change to improve health outcomes and eliminate health disparities.&quot; We will explore the historical and theoretical foundations, and the key principles of CBPR. Students will be introduced to methodological approaches to building community partnerships; community assessment; research planning; and data sharing. Real-world applications of CBPR in health will be studied to illustrate issues and challenges. Further, this course will address culturally appropriate interventions; working with diverse communities; and ethical considerations in CBPR.<br/><br/>Learn more about Beatriz Oralia Reyes here: http://www.northwestern.edu/globalhealthstudies/People/faculty/postdoctoral-fellows/beatriz-reyes.html"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Minkler, M., &amp; Wallerstein, N.
