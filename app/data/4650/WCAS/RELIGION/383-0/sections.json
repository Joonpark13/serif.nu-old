[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Beginning in the 1890s but stretching roots back to the medieval period, modern and contemporary Roman Catholic church teaching and academic ethics have been shaped by important domestic and international issues. This course will follow the trajectory of Roman Catholic social ethics from the late 19th century to the present. Among the trends and topics studied are the living wage movement, the Catholic Worker movement, peace and justice initiatives, liberation ethics, race, immigration, and environment. The transformation of sexuality and gender from &quot;private&quot; to &quot;social&quot; ethics will also be discussed. <br/>Our interest in this class is not to defend or defeat a particular perspective in ethics, but to use critical and analytical skills to show how an important, influential tradition in ethics has evolved over time. This is a core course for the Catholic Studies minor and for the Religion, Law. And Politics concentration in Religious Studies.", "name": "Catholic Social Ethics", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "383-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/RELIGION/383-0/24651", "instructor": ["Cristina L.H.
