[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Can you read your way to nirvana? Is enlightenment to be found at the end of a book, like the big reveal in some mystery novel? This course is an attempt to explore narrative, by which I mean entertaining stories rather than dry doctrine, as an important part of Buddhist expression, experience, and pedagogy. We will begin with the Sanskrit drama known as the Buddhacharita, continue on to select Jataka tales, bounce over to parts of the Tibetan Lalitavistara and Life of Milarepa, jump to collections of stories from China and Japan, and then leap forward to Herman Hesse's Siddhartha and Jack Kerouac's Dharma Bums. We'll also watch a modern Hollywood flick with Buddhist undertones (it's a surprise!). Throughout the course, we will ask a variety of questions, including: Does narrative provide a unique means of conveying or comprehending Buddhist ideas? What are the strength and weaknesses of narrative for Buddhist purposes? How do certain narratives and Buddhist ideas change in different historical and cultural contexts? What makes a story Buddhist or not, e.g. can a narrative with no obvious reference to anything Buddhist still convey Buddhist ideas? Is there anything about Buddhism that lends itself to the importance of narrative, and how might it be similar and different from the role of narrative in other religions?", "name": "Topics in Buddhism", "section": "20", "topic": "Buddhism through Its Stories", "course": "319-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/RELIGION/319-0/24598", "instructor": ["Charles Scott Preston"], "id": "24598", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
