We will balance our examination of particular traditions?including those originating in the Northwest, Southwest, Great Plains, Midwest and Southeast?with a consideration of broader themes including identity, artistic expression, politics, and the environment. We will also consider ethical issues pertinent to the study of Native American religions, such as the debate about cultural appropriation, and discuss the impact of colonialism on Native American religious groups."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Kelley, Dennis.
