[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course investigates some of the ways in which evolution finds its way from a purely scientific enterprise back to notions of the divine. It also looks at how spiritual systems have explored various ways to see the divine. Evolutionary Spirituality demands this project, as it recognizes levels of development not only of species, but of the human person, the human group and even group systems of thought. In each of these, there was a purely material stage of seeing existence, and in each, the spiritual returns, like a bad penny.....suggesting that it must be dealt with. We shall use Chopra's HOW TO KNOW GOD to show development of ideas about God. Wilber's EYE OF THE SPIRIT will provide some groundwork in Integral Theory. Marion's DEATH OF THE MYTHIC GOD accounts for the developmental experiences of human society and McIntosh's PRESENCE OF THE INFINITE shows the leading edge of spirituality in the Evolutionary movement.
