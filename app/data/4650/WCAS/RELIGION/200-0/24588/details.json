This course will emphasize the rich stories, philosophies, rituals, and cultural practices that are most commonly associated with Hinduism, but significant care will be taken to investigate and probe the ways in which the Hindu religion has been manifold and variable in history and throughout South Asia and beyond. To the extent that the classroom experience makes possible, we will try to emphasize the lived experience of Hinduism, in other words what it means to be Hindu in different political and historical moments, what it feels like to undergo rituals, to subscribe to certain philosophies, to produce and patronize religious art and music, and to know and think about the world through prominent myths and stories. The course will require a fieldwork exercise at a Hindu religious site in or around Chicago."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "The Life of Hinduism, edited by John Stratton Hawley and Vasudha Narayanan 978-0520249141<br/>An Introduction to Hinduism, Gavin Flood 978-0521438780<br/>The Bhagavad Gita, trans.
