[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The vast array of texts, practices, beliefs, social and political constructs, geographical variations, and historical contexts that fall under the vague subheading of &quot;Hinduism&quot; suggest that any introduction to the subject must be, at least, an introduction to &quot;Hinduisms.&quot; But it is just this variety that makes &quot;Hinduism,&quot; and the problem of the singular, so compelling. This course will emphasize the rich stories, philosophies, rituals, and cultural practices that are most commonly associated with Hinduism, but significant care will be taken to investigate and probe the ways in which the Hindu religion has been manifold and variable in history and throughout South Asia and beyond. To the extent that the classroom experience makes possible, we will try to emphasize the lived experience of Hinduism, in other words what it means to be Hindu in different political and historical moments, what it feels like to undergo rituals, to subscribe to certain philosophies, to produce and patronize religious art and music, and to know and think about the world through prominent myths and stories. The course will require a fieldwork exercise at a Hindu religious site in or around Chicago.", "name": "Introduction to Hinduism", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "200-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/RELIGION/200-0/24588", "instructor": ["Charles Scott Preston"], "id": "24588", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
