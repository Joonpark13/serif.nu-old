[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The notion of sin is one of the most central facets of religion in the Western world. Thinking of religion as a system that orients human beings to certain beliefs and actions, we naturally assume that a critical part of these beliefs and actions has to do with questions of right and wrong, and that the &quot;wrong&quot; in religious systems is often classified as &quot;sin.&quot; But what is &quot;sin,&quot; exactly? What constitutes a sinful act and what makes one a sinner? In this seminar, we will approach these questions from a critical point of view and delve into the very rich and complex concept of sin so as to understand how it has evolved through time and how it shaped and continues to shape our own world. <br/>At the center of the course will stand &quot;the seven deadly sins,&quot; an idea that started to develop around the fourth century C.E., according to which there are seven major sins that essentially generate all possible sins: gluttony, lust, anger, envy, greed, sloth, and pride. We will see how the &quot;seven deadly sins&quot; have emerged against the background of earlier notions of sin (Greek, Jewish, and Christian) and we will look closely into each one of those &quot;deadly sins,&quot; considering why and how it came to be viewed as a sin and how it resonates in the world in which we live.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "20", "topic": "The Seven Deadly Sins", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/RELIGION/101-6/24582", "instructor": ["Mira   Balberg"], "id": "24582", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
