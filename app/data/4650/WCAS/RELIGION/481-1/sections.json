[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The purpose of this class is to explore an array of questions and challenges pertinent to the study of religions and religious phenomena, and to chart out various avenues and directions for conceiving of \"Religious Studies\" as an academic discipline. The class is meant to introduce the students to some of the most elemental and influential works that have shaped the field, while at the same time using those works to trace the multiple directions in which the study of religion has developed recently. Essentially, this class provides a preliminary road map to help the students commence their own journeys as scholars of religion.<br/><br/>Although the class sets out to provide critical literacy in the so-called \"canon\" of Religious Studies, it is structured thematically rather than historically. Each session is dedicated to one critical term, which plays a definitive role in the study of Religion, and pairs together a \"classical work\" with other more recent pieces that address the same theme from a different angle. These pairings will help us trace how the field of Religious Studies is changing, and how theories and methods of the study of religion continue to evolve.", "name": "Classical Theories of Religion", "section": "20", "location": "Crowe 4-130 Rel Studies Sem Rm", "topic": "", "course": "481-1", "meeting_time": ["We 9:30AM - 12:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/RELIGION/481-1/27765", "instructor": ["Mira   Balberg"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27765", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
