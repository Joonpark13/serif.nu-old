It has also maintained a tight relationship to power, empire, and the making of what some scholars call &quot;modernity.&quot; While nine weeks is a short time to cover such a huge topic, we will examine a few cases studies of missionary action in the era of European global expansion and the development of overseas empires. We will focus on both Catholic and Protestant missionaries' efforts to convert non-Christians and build new Christian communities in the Americas, Japan, China, and South Asia."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 7:05 PM (CT)", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
