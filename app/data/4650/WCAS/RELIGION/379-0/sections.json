[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Christianity and Colonialism: Thinking about Conversion <br/><br/>From its beginnings, Christianity has been concerned with the making of new persons and worlds: the creation of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. It has also maintained a tight relationship to power, empire, and the making of what some scholars call \"modernity.\" While nine weeks is a short time to cover such a huge topic, we will examine a few cases studies of missionary action in the era of European global expansion and the development of overseas empires. We will focus on both Catholic and Protestant missionaries' efforts to convert non-Christians and build new Christian communities in the Americas, Japan, China, and South Asia.", "name": "Topics in Comparative Religion", "section": "20", "location": "Elder Hall 030 Seminar Room", "topic": "Christianity and Colonialism", "course": "379-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 3:00PM - 6:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/RELIGION/379-0/24595", "instructor": ["J Michelle   Molina"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "24595", "subject": "RELIGION"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This class will examine pilgrimage in historical, anthropological, and comparative perspective. It will begin by examining the origins, history, and modern experience of the Camino to Santiago de Compostela, one of the most important Christian pilgrimages, and one to which many pilgrims still go by traditional means: on foot. The second unit of the course will be devoted to theories of pilgrimage-that of Victor and Edith Turner, and then critiques of and alternatives to the Turner interpretation of pilgrimage. The third will return to Christian pilgrimages, surveying a variety of medieval and modern examples, and will explore how pilgrimage has changed over time, particularly in response to the challenges of modernity. Finally, the course will turn to manifestations of pilgrimage in other religious traditions and ask how those affect our understanding of the phenomenon.<br/> <br/>The central question in much literature on pilgrimage is how far the experience is unifying and bonding (i.e., how far it engenders a sense of <i>communitas</i> among those who travel together to the holy places), and how far, to the contrary, pilgrimage is always an experience of difference and contestation. Those who write about pilgrimage ask also about motives and their implications: what difference it makes whether the stated motives for undertaking pilgrimage are religious, spiritual, or secular. Pilgrimage is also a metaphor for life, and those who go on pilgrimage often view it as a life-transforming experience; understanding its significance thus means also seeing how pilgrimage relates to broader conceptions of religious life and behavior.", "name": "Topics in Comparative Religion", "section": "21", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-410", "topic": "Pilgrimage", "course": "379-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/RELIGION/379-0/24596", "instructor": ["Richard   Kieckhefer"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "24596", "subject": "RELIGION"}]
