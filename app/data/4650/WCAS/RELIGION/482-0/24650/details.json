We will study classic theories and the original texts from which the theories are developed, as well as the contemporary manifestations of the theory. We will ask: how do competing ideas about rights and duties; concepts of the self; understandings of the state and its power; and languages about the past and the future play a role in the seminal texts of justice? How can classic theories clarify current debates about distributive justice or political theology within the academy and our discipline(s) of religion, philosophy, and policy? In the second half of the quarter, we will explore the pragmatic implications of these theories of justice by looking closely at one case: climate change. In the classic literature we will have explored in Part I of the seminar, all theory has been developed in a world of intrinsic climatic security, if not constancy or stability. Yet, the UNIPCC has stated that this is no longer the case, and that the world is facing catastrophic changes that will affect all distributive systems. So, how will our theories of justice work? In claiming this as the central ethical issue of our time, scholars in theological and philosophical literatures have suggested the outworking of justice theory must have an immediate practical application and suggest responses, upon which we will reflect. We will both examine this claim and explore the implications of its acceptance or denial to test the limits of the theories of justice against the actuality of the world of scarcity that the case study describes, and raise questions about the nature, goal and meaning of the study of ethics and justice when scholars are called upon to shape policy."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "J.S.
