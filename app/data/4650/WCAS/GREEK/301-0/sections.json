[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "How is great art made by artists who cannot see the depth of their own work? A brilliant performer, who moves audiences profoundly, is shallow when asked about his performance. The scene is most familiar from Hollywood interviews. In Plato's Ion, all of which we shall read in Greek, the titular character is an award-winning ?rhapsode' or performer of poetry. Socrates interrogates Ion and we find that Ion is conceited but clueless. Socrates argues that performers and poets themselves are inspired by the gods. Is this a joke at Ion's expense? Or, as it seems, does Socrates seriously mean that Dante and your favorite recording artist are divinely inspired? If so, how does Socrates think inspiration works? How should a philosopher like him take advantage of it? How does Plato want us to see this argument alongside his infamous dismissal of artists like Homer and Ion in the Republic? We shall both sharpen our Greek on Plato's text and try to answer these interpretive questions. Since the Ion is short, we shall also have time to read brief passages on our theme from other works of Plato, notably the Republic.", "name": "Readings in Greek Literature", "section": "1", "topic": "Plato on Poetry", "course": "301-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/GREEK/301-0/22506", "instructor": ["John P F Wynne"], "id": "22506", "subject": "GREEK"}]
