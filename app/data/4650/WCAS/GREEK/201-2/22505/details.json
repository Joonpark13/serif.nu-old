In this course we will focus on ancient Attic prose by reading the entirety of Plato's Crito. We will pay close attention to grammar and style, but we will also study Platonic philosophy itself as revealed through Plato's depiction of Socrates as he discusses his own imminent execution by the Athenian state. Thereby students will not only immerse themselves in one of the great works of world literature but will also gain insight into the complexities of ancient Athenian culture, politics, and religion."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Completion of Greek 201-1 or permission of instructor"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "To enhance fluency in reading ancient Greek.<br/><br/>To solidify command of vocabulary and grammatical principles.<br/><br/>Build familiarity with literary and intellectual world of the Classical period."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Class participationDiscussionLecture: Three 50-minute lectures weekly<br/>Readings"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendanceClass participationExam, finalExam, mid-termQuizzes"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Lysias 1 and Plato's Crito, by Geoffrey Steadman ISBN: 9780984306565 (price ranges from $15-29)."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:59 PM (CT)", "subject": "GREEK"}]
