[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is the second of the second-year Greek series, designed to solidify the grammatical concepts learned in first-year while introducing students to the study of actual ancient literary texts. In this course we will focus on ancient Attic prose by reading the entirety of Plato's Crito. We will pay close attention to grammar and style, but we will also study Platonic philosophy itself as revealed through Plato's depiction of Socrates as he discusses his own imminent execution by the Athenian state. Thereby students will not only immerse themselves in one of the great works of world literature but will also gain insight into the complexities of ancient Athenian culture, politics, and religion.", "name": "Introduction to Greek Literature", "section": "1", "location": "Kresge 4364 Classics Sem Rm", "topic": "", "course": "201-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/GREEK/201-2/22505", "instructor": ["Ryan Christopher Platte"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "22505", "subject": "GREEK"}]
