[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is the first in an accelerated two-quarter series designed to teach students to read ancient Greek, making accessible much of the world's most influential literature, from the biblical New Testament to Homeric poetry and Platonic philosophy. Since this is an ancient language there will be no spoken component and we will move swiftly through the grammar and basic vocabulary required to read actual texts. These two quarters will, in fact, teach all the fundamentals of the language and lead students directly into second-year courses in the New Testament, classical Greek oratory, and Homeric epic. Thereafter students will be able to progress to a wide range of genres from the classical and post-classical periods, including ancient Greek history, poetry, philosophy, drama, and more.", "name": "Accelerated Elementary Ancient and Biblical Greek", "section": "1", "location": "University Library 3370", "topic": "", "course": "115-1", "meeting_time": ["MoTuWeTh 3:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/GREEK/115-1/22531", "instructor": ["Ryan Christopher Platte"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "22531", "subject": "GREEK"}]
