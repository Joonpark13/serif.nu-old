These two quarters will, in fact, teach all the fundamentals of the language and lead students directly into second-year courses in the New Testament, classical Greek oratory, and Homeric epic. Thereafter students will be able to progress to a wide range of genres from the classical and post-classical periods, including ancient Greek history, poetry, philosophy, drama, and more."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "none"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Small classroom lecture, interactive review, written assignments"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "participation, weekly quizzes, midterm, final"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Introduction to Greek 2nd Edition<br/>by Cynthia W.
