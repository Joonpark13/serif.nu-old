[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "If there's anything for which Asian Americans are usually exoticized and Orientalized, it's usually their traditions of religion and spirituality. What is strange, though, is that Asian American religions are seldom discussed in Asian American studies. In this course, we will try to use the topic of religion to think through Asian American studies. In the first part of the course, we will examine the way that religion has been framed in American public spheres in relation to Asia and discuss ways that Asian Americans have performed religion to disrupt this orientalizing framework, especially in literature, film, and art. In the second part of the course, we will look more closely at the lived religious practices of Asian Americans and their communities; this will include field trips to sites in Chicago and Evanston. Assignments will include weekly reading reflections, a novel/film/artistic review, and a community immersion project. This course should be of interest to students in Asian American studies, American and contemporary religions, and Global Asias.", "name": "Asian American Religions", "section": "1", "location": "Annenberg Hall G32", "topic": "", "course": "350-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ASIAN_AM/350-0/21885", "instructor": ["Justin K Tse"], "class_attributes": "Interdisciplinary Distro - See Rules<br/><br/>Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "21885", "subject": "ASIAN_AM"}]
