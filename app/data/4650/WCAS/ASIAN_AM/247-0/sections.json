[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, using theoretical frameworks developed in the study of popular culture and the field of Ethnic Studies, we will look into the complexities, compromises, and negotiations that go into Asian Americans representing themselves and being represented through U.S. mass culture and locally based grassroots cultural production. We will explore primary \"texts\" in Asian American popular cultures, and pair them with the theoretical analyses of Asian American popular culture studies, thinking about race at the intersection of class, gender, sexuality, and citizenship. If there is an Asian American popular culture, what is it? Who is engaging in it? Who is producing it and who is consuming it? And how does this shape our understanding of Asian American communities?", "name": "Asian Americans and Popular Culture", "section": "1", "location": "Harris Hall L06", "topic": "", "course": "247-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ASIAN_AM/247-0/21884", "instructor": ["Douglas Sadao Ishii"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "21884", "subject": "ASIAN_AM"}]
