[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "&quot;Asian America&quot; is a composite of ethnic communities formed by migration between the regions of &quot;Asia&quot; and the &quot;Americas.&quot; But how did these disparate groups came to become known as &quot;Asian America&quot;? In this course, we will explore the histories of various Asian American communities (e.g. Chinese American, Japanese American, Korean American, Filipina/o American, Indian American, Native Hawai'ian communities). Our readings will begin with the pre-World War II Asian American experiences of exclusion and community establishment. We will then consider how it is that these different communities became known as an Asian American &quot;community,&quot; especially through the experience of the Second World War. Finally, we will read stories of post-1960s migrations and the ideological and material divisions that have emerged in Asian America.", "name": "Introduction to Asian American History", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "214-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ASIAN_AM/214-0/21883", "instructor": ["Justin K Tse"], "id": "21883", "subject": "ASIAN_AM"}]
