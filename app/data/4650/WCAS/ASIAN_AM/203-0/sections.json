How has U.S. foreign policy impacted Arab-American histories and experiences? Where do Arab-Americans &quot;fit&quot; within the U.S.' racial classification system? How do the intersections of multiple identities and backgrounds inform Arab-American communities, cultural politics, and activism? What is anti-Arab racism, where does it stem from, and how does it manifest in daily life?", "name": "Topics in Asian American Social and Cultural Analysis", "section": "2", "topic": "Arab American Studies", "course": "203-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ASIAN_AM/203-0/21886", "instructor": ["Umayyah Eleanor Cable"], "id": "21886", "subject": "ASIAN_AM"}]
