Taking an interdisciplinary approach, we will read a variety of texts (including history, anthropology, literature, and cultural studies) to explore the following questions: What are the historical circumstances that have shaped Arab immigration to the U.S.? How has U.S. foreign policy impacted Arab-American histories and experiences? Where do Arab-Americans &quot;fit&quot; within the U.S.' racial classification system? How do the intersections of multiple identities and backgrounds inform Arab-American communities, cultural politics, and activism?
