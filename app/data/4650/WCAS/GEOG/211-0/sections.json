The first two weeks cover the meteorology necessary for understanding the local and global systems of atmospheric circulation. This leads to the K\u00f6ppen climate model which predicts the location of climate types. With climate as a basis, we then turn to the study of soils and vegetation. Soils are strongly influenced by climate and parent material and they vary in their ability to store water and recycle nutrients. Processes of plant growth respond directly to climate and soil productivity which leads to biomass production. All of the biogeographic processes are then used to derive expected patterns of natural vegetation around the world. Local-scale variations are brought in as modifications of the global model. Discrepancies between the predicted and what is actually found in a particular place generally reflect the role of human impacts. Tropical forests, savannas, deserts, grasslands, broadleaf and needleleaf forests, and tundra are all interpretable in terms of the physical processes developed in this course.", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "World Biogeography", "title": "WCAS GEOG 211-0-20 World Biogeography", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:43 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-2855", "instructor_name": "John Crandall   Hudson", "instructor_addr": "1810  Hinman Ave."}], "topic": "", "course": "211-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Geography 211 develops an integrated approach to studying the world's ecosystems-what they are like, where they are located, and how humans have influenced them over time.
