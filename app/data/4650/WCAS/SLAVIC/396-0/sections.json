[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course offers a cross-disciplinary approach to the concept of alternatives and choices. At any given moment, how many alternatives are possible? Is there really such a thing as chance or choice? On what basis do we choose? How does our understanding of the past affect the future? Can we predict the future? Professor Gary Saul Morson, a specialist in literature, and Professor Morton Schapiro, a labor economist specializing in the economics of higher education, will themselves offer alternative approaches to these questions based on the presuppositions of their respective disciplines. If you enjoyed reading The Signal and the Noise and want to dig into topics and questions like uncertainty, prediction, modelling, and judgment, this class is the perfect complement.", "name": "Topics in Literature and Arts", "section": "20", "topic": "Alternatives:  Modeling Choice", "course": "396-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/SLAVIC/396-0/25642", "instructor": ["Gary S Morson", "Morton O Schapiro"], "id": "25642", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
