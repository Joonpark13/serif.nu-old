[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will focus on the Silver Age of Russian poetry, the great period of poetic experimentation and innovation that runs from about 1890 to 1930. We will examine major poets from the Symbolist, Futurist, and Acmeist movements, along with manifestoes and key critical texts. Graduate students will be expected to do a brief (15 minute) presentation on a secondary reading by a contemporary of the poets under discussion (e.g. Shklovsky, Jakobson, Trotsky, Zhirmunsky, Tynianov, Bukharin, Lunacharsky, etc.). We will examine these poets both in the context of modernism generally, and in the light of the Russian political and cultural upheavals that first shaped and then suppressed their artistic experiments. We will pay particular attention to problems of translation; students may elect to do a translation with commentary for one of their assignments. Poets to be considered include: Briusov, Balmont, Gippius, Blok, Mayakovsky, Khlebnikov, Akhmatova, Mandelstam, Pasternak, Tsvetaeva.", "name": "Survey of 20th Century Russian Poetry", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "361-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 3:00PM - 5:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/SLAVIC/361-0/25610", "instructor": ["Ilya   Kutik"], "id": "25610", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
