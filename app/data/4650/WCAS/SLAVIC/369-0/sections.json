[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines the history of Russian drama through a selective reading and analysis of some of the major Russian plays of the19th and the 20th centuries. It will focus on the history of dramatic literature rather than that of theatrical performances. We will trace the development of Russian drama through its various historical phases, starting with Pushkin's adaptation of the Neoclassicist tradition and ending with Vampilov's modernist experimentation with absurd and fragmentation. We will evaluate the potentials and problems of reading plays in the theoretical framework of dramaturgical writings of both Russia and the West, and inquire into such prevalent elements of the Russian dramatic tradition as grotesque, fantastic, naturalism and tragicomedy. Through our selected texts we will explore both the process in which the lineage of the Russian dramatic composition was formed and transformed, and the interpenetration of this literary tradition with the dramatic heritages of other nations of the world.", "name": "200 Years of Russian Drama", "section": "1", "location": "Parkes Hall 223", "topic": "", "course": "369-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/SLAVIC/369-0/25611", "instructor": ["Hui   Zhang"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "25611", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
