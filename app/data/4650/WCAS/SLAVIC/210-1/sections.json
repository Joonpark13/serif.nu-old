[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Before Tolstoy and Dostoevsky came three canonical nineteenth-century Russian writers: Pushkin, Gogol, and Lermontov. In this early era, Russia was heavily in dialogue with Western European culture, which introduced Russia to a new genre of writing?the novel. Steeped in poetry, the gothic, and the Romantic, these writers' stylistically groundbreaking works resounded through the generations that followed them. This course will draw students into the history, culture, and society that produced these enduring titles in which a nose pops off a face and runs around town, a bet results in death (more than once), duels abound, and statues come to life and haunt the locals. Because these are long-studied classics of Russian literature, this course will take advantage of the abundance of critical material produced on these works for use in a final research paper.", "name": "Introduction to Russian Literature", "section": "1", "location": "Parkes Hall 224", "topic": "Pushkin, Gogol, Lermontov", "course": "210-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 1:00PM - 2:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/SLAVIC/210-1/25606", "instructor": ["Ilya   Kutik"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "25606", "subject": "SLAVIC"}]
