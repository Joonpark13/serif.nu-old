[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is the second in the sequence of three courses required of sophomores in the Brady Scholars Program in Ethics and Civic Life. In this course, we will be exploring rival philosophical theories of well-being. What, fundamentally, makes a person's life go well? Is a person better off the more he or she gets what she wants? Or the more enjoyment he or she gets out of life? And what of things like love, friendship, health, education, and creative expression? Do these things contribute to a good life in and of themselves, or only insofar as they enhance a person's satisfaction or enjoyment? In addition to such fundamental issues, we will consider some more specific questions related to the good life. For instance, what is the relation between being happy and being moral? Would it be better if we could live much longer lives than humans presently live? Is it bad to die? And is there a connection between having a good life and finding meaning or purpose in one's life?", "name": "The Brady Scholars Program", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 118", "topic": "The Good Life", "course": "273-1", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/PHIL/273-1/22843", "instructor": ["Stephen John White"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "22843", "subject": "PHIL"}]
