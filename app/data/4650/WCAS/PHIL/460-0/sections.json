[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "We will consider the nature of love, and the relationship among love, reasons, and reasoning. We will ask after the reasons that we have to love, the reasons that we have to act out of love and the relationship between these. We will investigate some familiar worries about the idea that love is responsive to reasons, conceived as arising from properties or features of the beloved. If it were, would it make sense to stop loving someone who lost the features in question? Would it make sense to \"trade up,\" abandoning the person whom one loves for someone who better exemplifies these features? We will also consider the implications of the fact that love itself does not seem to be an attitude to which we could reason. In combination with the idea that it makes sense to act out of love, this seems to cause trouble for attempts to understood practical reasons reductively in terms of practical reasoning. So we will ask about what love tells us about the relationship between explicit practical reasoning and the reasons that we have to act. Does making sense of love require us to expand our conception of practical thinking beyond explicit reasoning? What implications, if any, does this have for moral thinking and reasoning?", "name": "Seminar in Ethical Theory", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "460-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/PHIL/460-0/22787", "instructor": ["Kyla Sue Ebels Duggan"], "id": "22787", "subject": "PHIL"}]
