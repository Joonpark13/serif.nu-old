[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Navigating the world as epistemic agents comes with great responsibility. Our beliefs guide every aspect of our lives?from choices about our friends and lifelong partners to our votes for political leaders and our decisions about life-and-death matters. Should our beliefs be responsive to only truth-related features, such as evidence and reliability, or do our relationships with others also bear on the appropriateness of our beliefs? How should our belief-forming practices respond to worries about implicit bias that are likely to impact the credibility we afford to members of marginalized groups? How much should we rely on our own abilities as epistemic agents, and how much should we defer to others? Can we have knowledge in domains rife with deep disagreement, such as in ethics and politics? These are some of the questions we will take up in this class, with particular attention paid to the ways in which our places in the social world impact our status as knowers.", "name": "Theory of Knowledge", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute M164", "topic": "", "course": "255-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/PHIL/255-0/22730", "instructor": ["Jennifer Amy Lackey"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "22730", "subject": "PHIL"}]
