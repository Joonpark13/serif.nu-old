Since the end of the Cold War it has become apparent that individual countries cannot achieve the democratic ideal of a society of free and equal citizens in isolation. Current threats such as global warming, terrorism, global economic crises require global solutions that no individual country can provide on its own. Thus the main political challenge of the 21st Century is to figure out whether necessary conditions for democracy, such as citizens' political equality and participation, public deliberation, etc. can be reproduced at the global level. Can citizens have a say on political decisions that affect them even if they are reached outside the domestic borders of their own society? Is it possible to design a new international order in which global political decisions are made in a democratic way? In the seminar we will analyze this difficult set of questions by discussing some interesting recent proposals for a new international order with a focus on how they handle issues of international human rights standards, the global economic order, world poverty, etc.", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "First-Year Seminar in Philosophy", "title": "WCAS PHIL 109-6-20 First-Year Seminar in Philosophy", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:46 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "8474912550", "instructor_name": "Cristina   Lafont", "instructor_addr": "Crowe 1-127"}], "topic": "Rethinking Democ After Globalization", "course": "109-6", "enrl_requirement": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Freshmen and Sophomores", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This seminar focuses on the future of democracy under current conditions of globalization.
