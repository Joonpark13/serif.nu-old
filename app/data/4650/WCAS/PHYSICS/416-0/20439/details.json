This course will teach the basic concepts and skills underlying description of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium using Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics, including microscopic definition of entropy, and the development of microcanonical, canonical and grand canonical ensembles. Applications of statistical mechanics to ideal quantum and classical gases, nonideal gases, and magnetic spin systems including paramagnets and ferromagnets will be discussed. Additional topics including Brownian motion and conformational statistics of biomolecules may also be studied."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Graduate standing in Physics and Astronomy or permission of the instructor.
