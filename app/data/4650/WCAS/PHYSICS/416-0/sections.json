[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Statistical mechanics seeks to explain the link between large-scale and microscopic descriptions of physical systems with many degrees of freedom, such as gases, solids and liquids. This course will teach the basic concepts and skills underlying description of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium using Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics, including microscopic definition of entropy, and the development of microcanonical, canonical and grand canonical ensembles. Applications of statistical mechanics to ideal quantum and classical gases, nonideal gases, and magnetic spin systems including paramagnets and ferromagnets will be discussed. Additional topics including Brownian motion and conformational statistics of biomolecules may also be studied.", "name": "Introduction to Statistical Mechanics", "section": "20", "location": "Technological Institute L150", "topic": "", "course": "416-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/PHYSICS/416-0/20439", "instructor": ["John F Marko"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "20439", "subject": "PHYSICS"}]
