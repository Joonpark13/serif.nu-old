Specific topics to be covered: <br/><br/>Quarter 1 (PHYS333-1): Electrostatics and Magnetostatics. Electric charge, Coulomb's law, field and potential descriptions of electrostatics; Boundary value problems and analytical techniques for exact and approximate solutions of the Laplace and Poisson equations; Electrostatics in the presence of conductors and dielectrics; Steady currents and Lorentz force, field and potential descriptions of magnetostatics; Magnetic fields in materials. <br/><br/>Quarter 2 (PHYS333-2): Electrodynamics. Faraday's law and (Maxwell's version of) Ampere's law, Maxwell equations; Potential formulation of electrodynamics; Poynting's theorem and other conservation laws in electrodynamics; Electromagnetic waves; Electromagnetic radiation;<br/><br/>PHYS361-0 follows this sequence with discussion of special relativity and electromagnetism."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites for this class are a background in calculus based introductory physics<br/>(Physics 135-1,2,3 or the equivalent) and advanced mathematics beyond introductory differential and integral calculus.
