The goal of this class is to have the student gain a considerable knowledge of the state of contemporary Latino theatre in the United States by investigating a cross-section of plays that represent the diversity of communities and experiences represented under the term &quot;Latina/o&quot;. Through the reading, analyzing and discussion of plays, and the rehearsal and performance of monologues, the student actor will have the opportunity of exploring the diversity of Latina/o culture within a safe and inclusive creative space. While acting experience is not required and &quot;talent&quot; is viewed as relative, 100% investment is always an expectation."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "LectureReadingsInstruction will come from a combination of lecture, designed to complement the leadership and initiative of the student presenters assigned to each play, along with some cold reading of the dramatic literature. Student presenters will also be responsible for some general biographical information on the playwrights and brief production history, both of which should be easily available on-line and complimented by the professor. Students will be responsible for selecting monologues and scenes, although the professor reserves the right to make suggestions. Final scenes and monologues will be fully memorized and staged. In order to provide as broad a spectrum of material as possible, some critical articles may also be assigned prior to class, and portions of plays may be read out loud in class."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "AttendancePapersPresentationsSimulation / role-playAll students will be graded according to their level of commitment, participation, discipline, growth/progress and attendance.

In this course, we will explore how and why Latino/a youth participate in musical subcultures, such as, house, rave, punk, EMO, goth, and hip hop. First, we will define subculture, examine how the concept has changed over time among scholars, and apply the concept to the case of Latino/a youth subcultures. Second, we will explore how Latino/a youth create a sense of identity in subcultures and challenge societal norms around race, class, gender, and sexuality. We will pay special attention to the ways in which Latino/a youth have participated and made spaces for themselves in various subcultures that have been perceived as racially \"white,\" like goth or punk, or \"black,\" like house and hip hop. One public space we will pay attention to is the high school and how subculture groups behave and respond to school policies and norms. We will also examine the ways media portrays youth subcultures and how these representations are different to how youth portray themselves or self-representations with pictures, writings, dress, music, etc. Ultimately, this course will examine the ways in which Latino/a youth participate in subcultures to create spaces of belonging and express their unique ways of being and Latino/a cultural citizenship in the U.S.", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "Topics in Latina and Latino Text and Representation", "title": "WCAS LATINO 393-0-21 Topics in Latina and Latino Text and Representation", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:45 PM (CT)", "section": "21", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Yamil   Avivi", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "393-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Subcultures are often understood as bringing like-minded people together who feel marginalized by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity, and often challenge these standards.

In what ways do US racial projects or standing ideologies and discourses (of race, success, failure, violence, gangs, etc.) limit or discredit youth subcultures? Students will share through discussion and small writing exercises their personal experiences with other classmates on weekly topics. Ultimately, this will help students claim and share their own knowledge and social positioning in useful ways to think critically about the dynamics of race, gender, sexuality, and alternative forms of participation and citizenship in the US through musical subcultures. Such classroom discourse will encourage students to openly dialogue in ways that invite mixed perspectives and value a &quot;unity in difference&quot; dialogue of critical multiculturalism. For the final project, students will have the option to one of the following in light of the themes and key concepts we cover in class: conduct an interview project that generates perspectives around one or more subcultures; critically analyze either youth self-representations and how subcultures plays a role in their meanings; critically analyze dominant film and media texts and focus on how these texts collide with youth thought or counterideologies in subcultures; propose a local youth project (after school, during school, self-run, etc.) that addresses a need and involves using musical subculture, or a policy paper that consults either educators, non-profit organizations, or policy think tanks on how and why to incorporate subculture into pedagogy, youth programming, and direct services to attract today's youth in meaningful ways.
