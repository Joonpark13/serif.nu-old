He was an Associate Editor for the British Journal of Clinical Psychology and an Associate Editor for the Journal of Abnormal Psychology. His research interests focus on understanding the structure of anxiety and depression, risk factors for the development of anxiety and depressive disorders, clinical research methodology, developing more effective treatments for the anxiety disorders with a particular focus on generalized anxiety disorder and basic measurement theory and techniques. Dr. Zinbarg's theoretical orientation is primarily cognitive-behavioral though his clinical work has also been influenced by Motivational Interviewing and related work on common factors of psychotherapy. Most recently, through his collaboration with colleagues at The Family Institute, Dr. Zinbarg has also begun to incorporate systemic approaches to the understanding and treatment of anxiety disorders."}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/PSYCH/496-1/25549", "instructor": ["Richard E Zinbarg"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "25549", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
