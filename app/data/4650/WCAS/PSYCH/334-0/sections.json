[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Languages across the globe vary in how they codify experience. Do these variations in linguistic classification affect the way people think? The Whorfian hypothesis states that the language we speak influences the way we think, even in nonlinguistic contexts. This view suggests that differences across languages mold the thoughts of their users. <br/><br/>The Whorfian hypothesis was investigated in the 1960's and then (for reasons we'll discuss) it fell out of favor. Recently there has been a surge of new research on the Whorfian hypothesis in several domains. In this class we will discuss stronger and weaker forms of this hypothesis, and consider evidence for and against this hypothesis, as well as different ways in which language could interact with cognition. We will read papers that compare semantic structures across languages, as well as empirical papers that test whether these semantic differences matter in nonlinguistic tasks. The domains of study include space and number (which have both been the focus of much recent empirical work). We will also consider some of the following: causation, theory of mind, counterfactual reasoning, and color.", "name": "Language and Thought", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "334-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 1:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/PSYCH/334-0/25417", "instructor": ["Dedre   Gentner"], "id": "25417", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
