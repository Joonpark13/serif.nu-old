Although the emphasis is on psychological phenomena, we will consider research from artificial intelligence and other areas of cognitive science as well as research from cognitive psychology and cognitive development and how to integrate them in an overall account. Specific issues include:<br/><br/>? Theories of similarity and analogy in psychology and artificial intelligence<br/>? Analogical subprocesses: access, mapping, inference, and extraction of common principles<br/>? Analogy and similarity in learning and conceptual change<br/>? Analogical processing in development, including infancy<br/>? Analogy and similarity in categorization<br/>? Computational approaches to similarity and analogy<br/>? Analogy in language learning<br/>? Analogy in science"}], "lmod": "12/24/16 7:07 PM (CT)", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
