The course is designed for individuals with no prior coursework in neuroscience or biology, however, given the range of novel topics discussed, my hope is that it is equally interesting for individuals who have completed neuroscience coursework. Following an introduction to neurophysiology and neuroanatomy, topics to be covered include the neuroscience of perception, emotion and motivation, memory, mental illness, morality, and consciousness, to name a few."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "There will be three non-cumulative exams for the course.
