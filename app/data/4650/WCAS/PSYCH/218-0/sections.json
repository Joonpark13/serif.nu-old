[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The focus of this course is human development from infancy through adolescence. Students will learn how culture and context influence the development of perception, cognition, language, identity, and social interaction. The course considers perspectives and methods in developmental research. As each new topic is introduced, students are encouraged to think critically about the assumptions and methods that underlie research on particular issues. A central goal is to help students develop an appreciation of different criteria for evaluating research and other forms of evidence. The discussion sections will allow students to consider how theory and research are relevant in specific domains and will generally focus on more applied issues.", "name": "Developmental Psychology", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "218-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/PSYCH/218-0/25408", "instructor": ["Leoandra Elaine Rogers"], "id": "25408", "subject": "PSYCH"}]
