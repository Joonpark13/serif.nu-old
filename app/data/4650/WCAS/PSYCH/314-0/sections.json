[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The purpose of this course is to thoughtfully consider psychological theory, methodology, and empirical data relating to questions such as the following: What is it that makes us find beautiful people beautiful? How can evolutionary psychology explain why we find certain features beautiful? Where does this theory fail in terms of predicting perceptions of beauty? Is beauty really in the eye of the beholder? How have beauty ideals shifted over history? How are gender roles and sexual orientation related to beauty and its pursuit? Why is beauty associated with femininity? What cultural biases help those perceived as beautiful and hurt those perceived as lacking in beauty? Are beautiful people happier or more successful? In what ways are beauty standards sometimes destructive? How do cultural standards of beauty affect disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and body dysmorphic disorder?", "name": "Special Topics in Psychology", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 101", "topic": "Psychology of Beauty", "course": "314-0", "meeting_time": ["We 6:00PM - 8:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/PSYCH/314-0/25414", "instructor": ["Renee Suzanne Engeln"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "25414", "subject": "PSYCH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The human brain is severely limited in how much it can process and remember. How many times have you watched presenters ignore these limits, producing an information 'fire hose' effect where their audience understands and retains far too little? This class will survey techniques for avoiding this problem in your presentations, by understanding why and where our cognitive and perceptual limitations arise. We will focus on harnessing the power of a processing system that occupies over 40% of your viewer's brain - their visual system. We will explore visual presentation strategies that keep an audience's attention engaged, and a speaker's message understood and remembered.", "name": "Special Topics in Psychology", "section": "21", "location": "Tech Institute Lecture Room 4", "topic": "Presenting Data & Ideas", "course": "314-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/PSYCH/314-0/25415", "instructor": ["Steven   Franconeri"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>", "id": "25415", "subject": "PSYCH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will introduce students to the application of statistics to sports, by drawing on literature from sport psychology and statistical applications from the behavioral sciences.
