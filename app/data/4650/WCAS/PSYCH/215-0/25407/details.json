Specifically, students will be exposed to major personality theories and frameworks including genetic/biological approaches, trait approaches, narrative approaches, and temperament approaches. The remainder of the semester will be devoted to special topics such as personality development, person X situation interactions, personality and emotion, and personality and motivation. Personality psychology broadly defined represents the scientific study of individual differences. Thus, personality manifests in many areas of psychology, including clinical, social, developmental, industrial/organizational, and cognitive psychology. Throughout this course, we will strive to establish a basic understanding of social/personality theories and research as well as an individualized understanding of how social/personality psychology can be applied to a broad range of research areas.
