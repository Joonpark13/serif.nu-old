The remainder of the quarter is devoted to differential vector calculus, focusing primarily on Chapters 2 - 4 of the textbook. Topics covered include limits and partial derivatives as well as their properties and applications. The main application will involve finding extrema and constrained extrema of functions of several variables, with a particular focus on the method of Lagrange multipliers."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "ISBN: 978-0321780652 Vector Calculus, 4th ed<br/>Susan Colley<br/>Pearson<br/><br/>ISBN: 978-0321982612 Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 5th ed<br/>David Lay <br/>Pearson"}], "lmod": "12/25/16 7:03 PM (CT)", "subject": "MATH"}]
