[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Probability and Stochastic Processes is a\u00a0three-quarter sequence in probability and stochastic processes requiring background in calculus but not measure theory. The first quarter is a careful introduction to probability spaces, random variables, independence, distributions, and generating functions culminating in the Central Limit Theorem. The second and third quarters largely concern stochastic processes, including discrete and continuous-time\u00a0Markov chains, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, martingales, and diffusion processes. We will use the software package\u00a0R for simulations (no prior knowledge of R is required.)\u00a0This sequence covers more topics at a faster pace, and in greater depth than 310-1,2,3.<br/><br/>queues.
