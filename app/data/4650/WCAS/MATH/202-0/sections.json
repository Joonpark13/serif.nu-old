[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Primarily (but not only) for behavioral sciences. Topics chosen from set theory, combinatorics (the art of counting), finite probability, elementary linear algebra and its applications to linear optimization problems. Among other things, the course will focus on practical applications of these mathematical tools to real life situations, such as, elementary statistics, analyzing survey data, probability tests, supply and demand linear functions and equilibrium prices in economy, minimizing linear cost functions and maximizing linear profit functions in business. This class is popular with psychology, communication, journalism, international studies students to fulfill their math requirements.", "name": "Finite Mathematics", "section": "81", "topic": "", "course": "202-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 2:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/MATH/202-0/20647", "instructor": ["Daniel   Cuzzocreo"], "id": "20647", "subject": "MATH"}]
