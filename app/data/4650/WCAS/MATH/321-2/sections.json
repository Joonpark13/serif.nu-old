Real number system; metric space topology; sequences, series; continuity; differentiation; integration; sequences and series of functions; inverse and implicit function theorems. Sequence covers more topics, more abstractly, at a faster pace, and in greater depth than 320-1,2 and emphasizes analyzing and creating proofs. Students may not receive credit for both 320-1 and 321-1 or both 320-2 and 321-2.
