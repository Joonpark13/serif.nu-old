[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The course will emphasize examples throughout the year. Fall (topology): Topological spaces, fundamental group, covering spaces, principal bundles, vector bundles, classifying spaces. Winter (differentiable manifolds): differentiable manifolds; implicit function theorem and Sard's theorem; smooth vector bundles, tangent vectors, tensors, vector fields and flows. Lie derivatives, Lie groups and Lie algebras. Integral manifolds, Frobenius's theorem. Differential forms and the de Rham complex. Orientation, integration, Riemannian metrics, geodesics, exponential map. Spring (cohomology): de Rham cohomology, Mayer-Vietoris, Poincare' duality, singular homology and cohomology. Cohomolgy of cell complexes, simplicial cohomology, Cech cohomology. Cup product; sheaves.
