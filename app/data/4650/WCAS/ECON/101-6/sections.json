[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "World War II was clearly the most important single event of the twentieth century. However, the seeds for World War II were laid in World War I, making it necessary to study both wars. We will study both why these wars occurred and why they turned out the way they did. In asking why wars turned out the way they did, we will emphasize the size and performance of the economies involved, and such issues as why the U.S. and Soviet Union produced so much while Germany produced so little. In the last part of the course, students will have a chance to do independent research on any aspect of World War II which interests them, economic, political or military.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "20", "topic": "Did Economics Win Two World Wars?", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ECON/101-6/20947", "instructor": ["Robert J Gordon"], "id": "20947", "subject": "ECON"}]
