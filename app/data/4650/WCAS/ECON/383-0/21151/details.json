It aims at answering questions such as: by how much does a 5% price increase reduce the demand for a good? This course is about how to use data and modern software to build, evaluate, and use models to answer such questions. The course is taught in a computerized classroom. Each student sits at a computer terminal, which enables us to estimate and diagnose models in class. The course emphasizes the actual building of models.
