[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, we will study the many different facets of labor economics. We will look into the economic decisions that individuals, households, firms, and governments face in relationship to the labor markets. The topics we will cover include, among others: the decision to participate in the labor market, the tradeoff between labor and leisure, the demand for labor by firms, the impact of minimum wages, labor mobility, human capital acquisition, discrimination, and the link between labor markets and crime. The class will put an emphasis on applied microeconomic theory and empirical analysis. For each topic, we will study concrete examples emanating from all over the world, and make an intensive use of statistics. We are also very much interested in understanding the relationship between research and public policy.", "name": "Labor Economics", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L07", "topic": "", "course": "339-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ECON/339-0/21024", "instructor": ["Sara   Hernandez"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "21024", "subject": "ECON"}]
