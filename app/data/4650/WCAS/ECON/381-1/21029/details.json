Examples include the effects of education on earnings, the relation between the lengths of prison sentences and crime rates, and the relation between interest and inflation rates. Econometrics provides the statistical tools needed to infer these relations from data and test theory models of the relations. Thus, econometrics is the toolbox of empirical economics. This course covers the basic methods of empirical economics and provides tools that are needed to build and critically evaluate empirical econometric models. Topics will include the linear regression model, limited dependent variable models and causal inference."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "STAT 210 or equivalent, Econ 310-1 (310-2, 311 recommended); MATH 230, 234, 240 &amp; 314 (or equivalent)."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Two lectures per week (plus a discussion section on Fridays)"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "One to two midterm exams, a final exam, and problem sets"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Introduction to Econometrics by Stock and Watson, 3rd Edition updated (ISBN-13: 978-0133486872)."}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:57 PM (CT)", "subject": "ECON"}]
