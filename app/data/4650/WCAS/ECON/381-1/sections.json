[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Most of economics is concerned with understanding relations among variables. Examples include the effects of education on earnings, the relation between the lengths of prison sentences and crime rates, and the relation between interest and inflation rates. Econometrics provides the statistical tools needed to infer these relations from data and test theory models of the relations. Thus, econometrics is the toolbox of empirical economics. This course covers the basic methods of empirical economics and provides tools that are needed to build and critically evaluate empirical econometric models. Topics will include the linear regression model, limited dependent variable models and causal inference.", "name": "Econometrics", "section": "20", "location": "Tech Institute Lecture Room 3", "topic": "", "course": "381-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ECON/381-1/21029", "instructor": ["Frank   Limbrock"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "21029", "subject": "ECON"}]
