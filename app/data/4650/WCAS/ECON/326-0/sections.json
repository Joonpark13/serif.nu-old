[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines the underlying reasons why many countries are currently underdeveloped and the implications for individuals' well-being. The focus of the course is the study of microeconomic issues in development. We will ask such questions as &quot;Do the poor under-invest in education and health?&quot; and &quot;Can public policy be used to improve the well-being of people living in developing countries?&quot; Other topics include credit and microfinance, informal and formal insurance, and political economy. We will combine insights from economic theory and empirical analysis using data from low income countries to investigate these questions.", "name": "The Economics of Developing Countries", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "326-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ECON/326-0/21145", "instructor": ["Lori A Beaman"], "id": "21145", "subject": "ECON"}]
