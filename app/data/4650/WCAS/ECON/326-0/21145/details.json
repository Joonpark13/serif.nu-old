The focus of the course is the study of microeconomic issues in development. We will ask such questions as &quot;Do the poor under-invest in education and health?&quot; and &quot;Can public policy be used to improve the well-being of people living in developing countries?&quot; Other topics include credit and microfinance, informal and formal insurance, and political economy.
