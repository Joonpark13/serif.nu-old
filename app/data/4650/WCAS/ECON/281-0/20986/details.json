We will start with simple linear regression, incorporating tools of statistical inference such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. Then we will incorporate more variables with multiple linear regression, and explore nonlinear regression functions, binary dependent variables, and other topics. A key part of this course will be learning to use the statistical software, Stata. Students will analyze real datasets with Stata on problem sets during the quarter, building a valuable skill set."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Econ 201, Econ 202, Stat 210"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lectures and TA section"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Problem sets, one midterm, and a final exam"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "We will use Introduction to Econometrics by James H.
