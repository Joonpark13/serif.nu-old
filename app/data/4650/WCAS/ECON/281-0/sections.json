[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an introduction to econometrics, a field in which statistical tools and data are utilized in the analysis of economic questions. We will start with simple linear regression, incorporating tools of statistical inference such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. Then we will incorporate more variables with multiple linear regression, and explore nonlinear regression functions, binary dependent variables, and other topics. A key part of this course will be learning to use the statistical software, Stata. Students will analyze real datasets with Stata on problem sets during the quarter, building a valuable skill set.", "name": "Introduction to Applied Econometrics", "section": "20", "location": "Leverone Auditorium Owen Coon", "topic": "", "course": "281-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 4:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ECON/281-0/20986", "instructor": ["Daley Catherine Kutzman"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "20986", "subject": "ECON"}]
