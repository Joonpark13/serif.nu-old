[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course develops several simple models for thinking about the determinants of variables like aggregate employment, unemployment, investment, consumption, interest rates, inflation, exchange rates and the balance of trade. The framework is used to address issues such as: what is the role of saving in determining the long run wealth of the country; what is the role of money in accounting for inflation; what are the factors accounting for the recurrent fluctuations in employment and output called the business cycle; what factors account for fluctuations in the US dollar; what risks, if any, do the high US government deficits and large U.S. international deficits pose for the health of the US economy? Particular attention in Winter 2017 will be given to the causes of and solutions to the U. S. financial market meltdown of 2008-09, the causes of the slow recovery since 2009, the outlook for future growth, and the ongoing problem of high unemployment and slow growth which plagues Europe.", "name": "Macroeconomics", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "311-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ECON/311-0/21013", "instructor": ["Robert J Gordon"], "id": "21013", "subject": "ECON"}]
