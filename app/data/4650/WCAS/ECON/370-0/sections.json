This course will examine the application of economic tools to environmental and resource issues, illustrating both the power of markets and the problem(s) with markets. Over the quarter, we will study three major reasons for such problems (and their solutions) in the context of the environment: externalities, public goods, and property rights. We will discuss the merits and shortcomings of the valuation methods used by economists and policy-makers to place dollar values on environmental amenities, as these valuations define the tradeoffs faced by individuals, firms, and policy-makers. Once armed with these tools, we will focus on applications to specific markets for environmental goods and natural resources (e.g. pollution, energy, water, land, fisheries and forestry).
