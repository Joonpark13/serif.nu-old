This course explores the role of intersectional identity in technological transformations in media, focusing on the transition from analog to digital. Students will read historical case studies and theoretical essays on such topics as how social media affect how queer users interact and self-identify, how race influences cable TV distribution, and how gender shaped early radio. The course is organized into three key areas of inquiry - culture, organization, and technology - with the goal of understanding the complex ways they interrelate."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:59 PM (CT)", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}]
