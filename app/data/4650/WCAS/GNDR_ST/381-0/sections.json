[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will introduce students to queer performance in the United States from the 1970s onward. We will examine a broad range of queer performance productions and practices situated in various settings, from activist street protest to theater plays, from mainstream media performance to performances in LGBTQ nightlife scenes. Some of the performers and troupes we will examine are Tango Lesbiango, ActUP, Ron Athey, RuPaul, Micha C\u00e1rdenas, Mangos with Chili, The Cockettes, Sister Spit, Margaret Cho, and Sins Invalid. Through seminar discussions, lectures, student presentations, and writings assignments (short essays/performance reviews/blogs), students will become familiar with methods and theories from queer studies and performance studies and will learn to apply them to the critical analysis and historicization of queer performances circulating on both local and national scales. Together we will unpack how &quot;queer&quot; is deployed within the performances we examine. How is &quot;queer,&quot; as a term that can either describe an identity or ways of being/doing, troubled and revised by the performers to account for the intersections of gender, sexuality, race, disability, and/or ethnicity? Integrated into the course curriculum will be a group trip to a local festival or theater, wherein students will have an opportunity to apply the methods and theories learned in the course to observing, documenting, and analyzing live, queer performance.", "name": "Queer Theory", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "381-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/GNDR_ST/381-0/24163", "instructor": ["Jillana B Enteen"], "id": "24163", "subject": "GNDR_ST"}]
