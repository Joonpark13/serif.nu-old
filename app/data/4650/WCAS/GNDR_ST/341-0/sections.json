Attention will be paid to historical and cultural contexts, but the emphasis will be on the analysis of literary texts by writers repre-senting Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Morocco and Egypt. Our discussions will focus on issues of exile, language, translation and colonialism, using as points of entry a diverse set of texts including articles on the African literary tradition, short stories by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Sindiwe Magona and novels (set in the twentieth century) by: Ama Ata Aidoo, Buchi Emecheta, Nawol Al Saadawi, Mariama B\u00e2 and Fatima Mernissi. In our exploration of African womens' literary traditions we seek to answer: in what ways these writers speak to each other (even across genre)? Where do literary representations engage with or counter the society around them? What is the influence of other black creative expression (i.e. music, visual art, dance) on the development of the tradition?
