[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are computer systems that allow users to construct, visualize, and analyze geospatial data. While its use is trans-disciplinary, the course will focus on how to apply GIS techniques to important scientific questions in the environmental sciences. Specifically, students are introduced to exemplar problems in climate science, hydrology, and ecology that require geospatial analysis. Using these authentic scientific tasks as a motivational context, students learn the basic techniques for both acquiring and analyzing vector (i.e., points, lines, polygons) and raster (i.e., gridded) datasets. This includes spatial data acquired from airborne / spaceborne remote sensing, and other mapping techniques. Data is primarily analyzed using the professional standard in GIS software?ArcGIS?. Instruction will assume no prior experience using this software, however, basic computer proficiency is expected of incoming students.", "name": "Special Topics in Environmental Sciences", "section": "21", "location": "Technological Institute MG51", "topic": "Applied GIS", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 5:00PM - 8:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENVR_SCI/390-0/24086", "instructor": ["Michael William Ribant"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "24086", "subject": "ENVR_SCI"}]
