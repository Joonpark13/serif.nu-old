Topics include the history and projections of human population growth, harvested populations and their economics, and methods of population viability analysis for endangered species. Important context for the growth of populations is developed from basic concepts in ecology and evolution, such as the ecological niche, competition, predation, disease transmission, trophic structure, and energy flow. More advanced topics will also be addressed, including the biodiversity-stability relationship, the economic values of biodiversity and ecosystem function, and the biology and management of metapopulations in fragmented habitats."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "CHEM 103 or equivalent"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Introduce the concept of the ecological niche, and the limits on the distribution and abundance of populations.
