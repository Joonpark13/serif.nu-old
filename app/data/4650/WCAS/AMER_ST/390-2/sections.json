[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Unlike most courses, the purpose of this course is not to introduce a series of texts or a corpus of concrete information, but rather to provide a framework within which you can pursue your own interests and develop your own ideas. More than anything else, this course is a hybrid of the research seminar and the writing workshop, and we will confront the challenges of both researching and writing in a collaborative manner. To that end, some of our sessions will be devoted to reading and responding to one another's work. While it can be difficult and intimidating to publicly present your work, and to publicly critique or question another's work, we shall undertake both in the spirit of support and assistance. Becoming a careful reader, responder, and recipient of constructive criticism are also invaluable skills that fundamentally inform the process by which virtually all scholarly work is produced.", "name": "Senior Project", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "390-2", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/AMER_ST/390-2/22285", "instructor": ["Ivy G Wilson Jr"], "id": "22285", "subject": "AMER_ST"}]
