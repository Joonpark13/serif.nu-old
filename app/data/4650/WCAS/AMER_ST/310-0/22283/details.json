To study it through digital means, however, reveals important connections between the history of the revival and issues of technology, culture, and politics in the modern world. To investigate these connections, we'll examine this revival through readings, audio listening, documentary films, seminar discussions, and extensive digital analysis. We'll probe what was at stake in the folk revival in relations to American culture and politics; questions of race, class, gender, age, and region; and music-making, memory, and power."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:53 PM (CT)", "subject": "AMER_ST"}]
