The phrase &quot;you are what you eat&quot; suggests that the act of eating is one of entrenchment: food choices represent and intensify one's own cultural and personal identity. However, considering the issues of food access, obesity, monocropping, and unfair or illegal food labor practices that are characteristic norms of today's American food system, this may now be an inaccurate - or at the very least - uncomfortable maxim. Not only does a substantial portion of America's food now come from international markets, cultural diversity within the U.S. has become an increasingly fraught political marker of the neoliberal multicultural state. With this in mind, then perhaps feminist theorist bell hooks' theory of &quot;eating the other&quot; may better describe the appetites of today. This course interrogates ideas of agency and food identity by examining it against the constraints of power and inequality in the American food system."}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "AMER_ST"}]
