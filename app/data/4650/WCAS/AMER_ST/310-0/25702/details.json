Drawing from anthropological and sociological case studies, we will examine various rites of passage experienced by teens in the U.S. In analyzing these rites, students will become conversant with theories of ritual, contemporary surveys of teen demographics and cultural trends, gender studies and cultural studies literature dealing with teen popular media and consumption, as well as historical literature on the rise and development of the American teenager as a cultural phenomenon. Students will be asked to generate original research for their seminar final project, applying the tools of the course to a case study of their own choosing. This seminar will make rigorous use of multimedia primary source materials and will require multi-source digitized media viewing and analysis as integral to course assignments. Attendance is required and recorded."}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:53 PM (CT)", "subject": "AMER_ST"}]
