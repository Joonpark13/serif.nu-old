[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The course is about model parameter estimation and inverse problems, that is: the application of linear algebra to the modeling of series of geophysical, geochemical, and environmental data. Model parameters will be extracted from large amounts of imperfect data. Students learn to model data using linear algebra, optimization techniques, and common physical sense. In the past, lab exercises have included locating and characterizing 1) earthquakes from seismographic data, 2) caves from gravity data, 3) the electrical conductivity of different subsurface layers from magneto-telluric data, 4) the consistency of Earth's mantle & crust from seismographic data, 5) the sources of chemical weathering recorded by riverine isotope ratios, and 6) fitting curves to data points, such as hockey-stick curves of global temperature data. Students may bring their own data set to class, to model in a final project.", "name": "Mathematical Inverse Methods in Earth and Environmental Sciences", "section": "01", "location": "Technological Institute F491", "topic": "", "course": "329-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/EARTH/329-0/23806", "instructor": ["Suzan   van der Lee"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "23806", "subject": "EARTH"}]
