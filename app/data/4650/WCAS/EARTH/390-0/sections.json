Broad topics include resource evaluation, the global distribution and formation of economic deposits, mineral processing techniques and mining and the environment. Topics in resource evaluation will include an introduction to the economic principles behind metals production and consumption, ore body description, the statistical approach to sampling deposits and the determination of cut-off grades. A large portion of this course is dedicated to understanding the physical and geochemical processes that concentrate earth materials into metallic deposits, industrial mineral and salt deposits, and fossil energy materials. Topics in mineral processing will focus on the separation and extraction of minerals from ore and will include crushing, gravity concentration, and flotation processes. The course will conclude with an examination of mining-related environmental issues such as acid mine drainage, heavy metal contamination and the deep disposal of dangerous waste.", "name": "Special Topics in Earth and Planetary Science", "section": "02", "location": "Technological Institute F285", "topic": "Mineral Resources", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/EARTH/390-0/23804", "instructor": ["Wayne Theodore Marko"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "23804", "subject": "EARTH"}]
