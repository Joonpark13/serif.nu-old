[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Earth System Modeling is an introduction to the art and science of reducing Earth's complex systems into simple numerical models. This course will survey core Earth system science topics, introduce numerical modeling concepts, and facilitate the construction of dynamical models in a hands-on computational laboratory environment. Core topics reviewed and modeled include Earth's energy balance, carbon cycle, and climate. The lecture portion of the course will highlight/review Earth science concepts, while the modeling component of the course will focus on the design, construction, and use of models to test hypotheses, and increase understanding of the forces and processes that shape the global environment. The modeling software to be used will be appropriate to undergraduates and beginning graduate students who do not have previous experience with solving differential equations or with computer programming, though students with these skill sets will appreciate the manifestation of numerical rules in the software package. Ultimately, this course is designed to empower students with introductory modeling skills that can be used to build a better understanding of how Earth's various components interact and evolve.", "name": "Earth System Modeling", "section": "01", "topic": "", "course": "343-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/EARTH/343-0/23807", "instructor": ["Daniel Ethan Horton"], "id": "23807", "subject": "EARTH"}]
