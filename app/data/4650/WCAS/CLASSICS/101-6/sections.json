[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "A Greek temple; Mozart's Requiem; Hollywood stars; sunset in a National Park. Most of us would agree these things are beautiful. Are we right? A mathematical proof; a martyrdom; noise rock; a touchdown; a worm. Some but fewer people would find each of these beautiful. Are they right? What, if anything, do the things we call beautiful have in common? <br/><br/>The tradition of western philosophy began in ancient Greece and Rome, where important thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, or St. Augustine (whose phrase is the title of this seminar) thought carefully about beauty. They tended to think that beauty is a certain order or harmony and that beauty leads us to an understanding of goodness. They think if you deny that a beautiful temple is beautiful, you're wrong.<br/>In modern times, thinkers like Kant or Hume have reconsidered beauty. Some have suggested that beauty is more ?in the eye of the beholder'. Beauty might have more to do with the delight or calm we take from an object. Other philosophers and artists have denied that beauty is real at all, or declared that it is only for snobs or for rednecks, or that it is dangerous and deceitful. We shall read selections from these ancient and modern thinkers and consider carefully what things are beautiful according to them. We shall look for and discuss controversial examples of beauty or ugliness. We shall put the two together in rigorous, precise critical thought, and writing.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "1", "topic": "Beauty, So Old and So New", "course": "101-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/CLASSICS/101-6/22483", "instructor": ["John P F Wynne"], "id": "22483", "subject": "CLASSICS"}]
