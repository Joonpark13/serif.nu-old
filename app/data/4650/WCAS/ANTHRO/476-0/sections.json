[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "&quot;Globalization talk&quot; has grown wildly in scholarly and popular discourse over the last decades, frequently supplanting &quot;capitalism,&quot; &quot;imperialism,&quot; &quot;transnationalism,&quot; and, in a sense, &quot;postmodernism.&quot; Globalization is ordinarily used to refer to increasing contemporary international economic, political, and cultural integration. Some wish to claim this tightening set of linkages is a novel global phenomenon, while others point to the long histories of waxing and waning political-economic and cultural ties. In this seminar, we will link this polysemous referent explicitly to the history of global capitalism, with special foci on the rise of neoliberal capitalism and with it increasing economic inequality worldwide, on the shifting meanings of national identity, on labor and commodities, and on the world's foremost imperial power since the Second World War, the United States?with a particular emphasis on the history of US/Muslim state relations and imaginaries. We will also use the globalization question to highlight considerations of the transnationality of changing race and gender/sexuality relations in a variety of global contexts, and to revisit the thorny issue of historically and political-economically informed ethnographic cultural analysis. Readings will be anthropologically focused but broadly interdisciplinary, with many ripped-from-the-headlines contributions. Seminar participants will each co-facilitate two discussions of readings-in which each co-facilitating pair will take extra responsibility for providing pr\u00e9cis and guiding seminar discussion. Evaluation will include seminar participation and a take-home final synthetic essay exam on course readings.", "name": "Globalization &amp; Discontents", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "476-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 5:00PM - 7:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ANTHRO/476-0/23183", "instructor": ["Micaela   di Leonardo"], "id": "23183", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
