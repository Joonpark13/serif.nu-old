[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course provides a broad overview of forensic anthropology - an applied subfield of biological anthropology. Forensic anthropology focuses traditional skeletal biology on problems of medicolegal significance, primarily in determining personal identity and assisting in the cause of death assessment from human remains. In this course we will discuss the full range of issues associated with human skeletal identification from trauma analysis to the identification of individuals in mass disasters. These problems will serve as a model for understanding the broader aspects of applied anthropology.", "name": "Forensic Anthropology", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "316-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ANTHRO/316-0/23182", "instructor": ["Erin Beth Waxenbaum Dennison"], "id": "23182", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
