In this seminar, students will read about, discuss, write about, and thus gain the intellectual tools to evaluate past and present American urban inequalities-including not only class, but race/ethnicity, gender & sexuality, nationality. We will read across several different academic disciplines and journalism to become familiar with key analytic concepts and methods, such as political economy, the Great Compression, urban regimes, ethnography. Using them, we will explore arenas of inequality: employment; urban space, housing, and neighborhoods; schooling, criminal justice, the public sphere.

In this course we will explore the intersections between human and primate lives in an effort to understand how we view primates, what factors influence those views, and how both humans and primates are ultimately affected. Using writing and discussion, we will consider primates in the media, primates as pets, primates in research, and primate conservation, among other topics. At the end of this course you will be able to evaluate how accurately primates are portrayed in a range of contexts and understand the consequences of those portrayals. You will have a stronger appreciation for the complex relationship between humans and primates worldwide and how it affects our everyday lives.
