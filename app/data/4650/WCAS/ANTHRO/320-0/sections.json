[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course introduces students to major themes in the anthropological study of Africa, the world area that most inspired the development of anthropology as a discipline. Examining the diversity of contemporary African societies and moments in the colonial past, we will explore in depth several related themes that derive from the classics as well as the contemporary anthropological corpus. These themes center on the creation of social ties, making a living, and managing health and uncertainty in volatile times. Specific topics will include kinship and marriage, production and exchange, health, population, economic development, corruption, political patronage, war, and the dynamics of movement and transnationalism.", "name": "Peoples of Africa", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L06", "topic": "", "course": "320-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 5:00PM - 7:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ANTHRO/320-0/23082", "instructor": ["Caroline H Bledsoe"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "23082", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
