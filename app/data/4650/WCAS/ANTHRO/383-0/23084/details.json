While the meaning of these terms may appear static or straightforward, the significance, value, and even materiality of what falls under the designation of &quot;environment&quot; is under constant socio-political and scientific negotiation. Nothing makes this more evident than today's ongoing political battles over climate change, resource-use, contamination, and conservation. To situate the terms that describe the more-than-human world around us, this course examines both the historical construction of the terms in the title, as well as other configurations of human-nonhuman relations of other societies and cultures. Doing so will trouble our assumed separation between &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;culture&quot; and challenge us to think through present-day environmental politics in new and different ways. As a survey-type course, we will read a variety of socio-cultural anthropology texts, including classic studies and recent publications. The middle portion of this class will pay particular attention to Anthropogenic Climate Change aka Global Warming as our central case study to think with. Additional texts will examine other environmental controversies and you will have the opportunity to explore in depth an environmental issue of your choosing for your midterm paper. While there are no prerequisites, a familiarity with basic concepts of sociocultural anthropology is assumed."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "50-70 pages of reading per/week<br/>Active participation in class<br/>Weekly reading responses (8 total) posted on line 4-500 words<br/>Short online comments to other students' responses (8 total)<br/>Take-home Midterm <br/>Final Paper"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture and Discussion<br/>Writing and Activity Workshops<br/>Screen-free classroom unless permission previously granted"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class Participation: 25%<br/>Reading Responses: 20%<br/>Midterm Exam: 25%<br/>Final Paper: 30%"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Tim Choy. 2011.

I will lecture for 35 minutes we will take a short break and then proceed to a 35 min discussion or activity. I will not provide copies of my lecture notes or power point slides. If you have questions on the lectures?ask in class or office hours. No screens (including phones, computers, or tablets) in class. You will need to take hand-written notes to aid your learning process (please speak to me in private if you require a laptop to accommodate your ability to participate in class). You may use a tablet in class if you plan to use it for reading books, brought to class on days pertaining to those books. This is an experiment in cultivating attention in class (for you and me both!) in a world where we are under constant temptation to click, tweet, snap, and like! I recommend photographing your lecture notes though as a backup!"}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:53 PM (CT)", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
