[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course, students will learn about the logic of inquiry in archaeology - key theories, concepts and approaches; characteristic habits of thought; techniques and intuitions. In particular, we will discuss how archaeology articulates with the other sub-fields of anthropology. We will approach the subject through the basic dimensions of archaeological enquiry (and, arguably, most enquiry in the human sciences): space, time, materiality, and the relationship between present and past. Student will write a final paper applying what they have learnt to a specific topic in their research.", "name": "Logic of Inquiry in Anthropology (Archy)", "section": "20", "location": "ANTHRO Sem Rm 104 - 1810 Hinmn", "topic": "", "course": "401-2", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ANTHRO/401-2/23126", "instructor": ["Matthew H Johnson"], "class_attributes": "Department Majors Only<br/><br/>Graduate Students Only<br/><br/>", "id": "23126", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
