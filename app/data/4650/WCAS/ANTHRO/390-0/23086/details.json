Popular culture - including films, music, poetry, street art, the internet, and television - has been a critical means for expressing political viewpoints and indeed motivating political action. It has also been used by groups and governments seeking to maintain power and repress populist sentiment. This course will take a careful and critical view of different examples of popular culture from across the region, asking what kind of politics they embody and enable. We will concentrate on what popular culture tells us about social change and hierarchies of power related to nation-states, generations, social class, gender, race/ethnicity, and religion."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "None"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "20% participation<br/>40% take home final<br/>25% short paper<br/>15% homework exercise"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "One large coursepack of articles"}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "ANTHRO"}]
