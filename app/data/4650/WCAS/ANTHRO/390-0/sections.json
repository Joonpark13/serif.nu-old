Popular culture - including films, music, poetry, street art, the internet, and television - has been a critical means for expressing political viewpoints and indeed motivating political action. It has also been used by groups and governments seeking to maintain power and repress populist sentiment. This course will take a careful and critical view of different examples of popular culture from across the region, asking what kind of politics they embody and enable. We will concentrate on what popular culture tells us about social change and hierarchies of power related to nation-states, generations, social class, gender, race/ethnicity, and religion.", "name": "Topics In Anthropology", "section": "21", "location": "Kresge 4531 MENA Seminar Rm", "topic": "Protest & Popular Culture in the Middle East", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["Fr 1:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ANTHRO/390-0/23086", "instructor": ["Jessica R Winegar"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "23086", "subject": "ANTHRO"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Did you know that all the microbes on and in your body weigh as much as your brain?

Tensions arise in questions of agency vs. control, nature vs. culture, identity construction, reproducing under varying conditions, and so on. Among all the topics in reproduction, obstetrics, the technical study and practice of childbirth, offers one of the most fascinating applications of anthropology.
