[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Kings, Courtesans and Khan Artists: Picturizing Islam and Muslims in Bombay Cinema (a.k.a. Bollywood)<br/> <br/>India is home to the second largest population of Muslims on earth. It's also host to the world's largest film industry, best known as Bollywood. Little wonder, then, that Bollywood films regularly feature Muslim characters, social spaces, and cultural references that are readily marked or coded as \"Islamic.\" But in spite of a large coterie of Muslims working within the industry - as actors, song writers, or producers - the representation of Muslims in Indian films has consistently raised complex issues around ideas of identity and belonging in a nation where they constitute a clear minority. This class will introduce students to the various strands of Muslim representation in Indian cinema, including Muslims as kings, as courtesans, as criminals, and as terrorists, among other typologies. We will read these films against the historical backdrop of the search for national identity in post-colonial India, as well as in the context of the so-called \"war on terror.\" Students will be given the opportunity not only to learn about Indian (particularly Bombay) cinema, but also to explore how cinematic representations intersect with issues of identity and belonging in the modern nation-state.", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "University Library 3322", "topic": "Kings, Courtesans and Khan Artists: Picturizing Is", "course": "110-6", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ASIAN_LC/110-6/22456", "instructor": ["Daniel Joseph Majchrowicz"], "class_attributes": "WCAS First-Year Seminar<br/><br/>", "id": "22456", "subject": "ASIAN_LC"}]
