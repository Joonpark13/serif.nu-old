Less well known, however, are the remarkably rich - and remarkably diverse - literary cultures that the Mughal court promoted, and which saturated the cultural, political, and religious life of early modern India more generally. This course will introduce students to some of the basic features of these intersecting Indo-Persian, Sanskrit, and Hindi-Urdu literary worlds (in translation, of course), as well as to their lasting - and sometimes controversial - legacies in modern South Asian culture and politics, from British India to Bollywood."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "None - but &quot;History of Early Modern India&quot; (HIS 385-1) and/or &quot;History of Modern South Asia&quot; (HIS 385-2) are recommended."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Final paper (~15pp)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Assorted readings uploaded to Canvas"}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "ASIAN_LC"}]
