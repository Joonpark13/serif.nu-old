[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "A scriptive thing, according to Robin Bernstein, \"broadly structures a performance while simultaneously allowing for resistance and unleashing original, live variations that may not be individually predictable.\" Everyday objects in imperial China had the potential, in the hands of their literati interpreters, to invoke performances that transcended their ordinary uses, and create new principles of appreciation. Objects became scriptive things in the cultures of connoisseurship that characterized the late Ming, but even as early as the Tang, an object as ordinary as a pen was a provocation to literary parody. Drawing from selected readings in performance studies, thing theory, and material culture studies, this course will analyze the representations of things in literature of the pre-modern period, and their role as scriptive things in the lives of their handlers. In this discussion-based seminar, we will read primary texts in translation, including pseudo-biographies, short stories, and drama, as well as secondary literature in the study of the material culture of pre-modern China, covering props, rock collections, clothing, musical instruments, portraits and other ?things'. Pending availability, this class may spend one session as a field trip, examining objects from the collection in the Art Institute.", "name": "Introductory Topics in Asian Languages and Cultures", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-410", "topic": "Scriptive Things in Pre-modern China", "course": "290-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ASIAN_LC/290-0/22403", "instructor": ["Anne Elizabeth Rebull"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "22403", "subject": "ASIAN_LC"}]
