[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Wordsworth's &quot;Preface&quot; to Lyrical Ballads offers a definition of poetry sometimes read as a kind of motto for British Romanticism: &quot;Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings&quot; which &quot;takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility.&quot; Feeling and its representation are at the center of this vision of the Romantic project, in poetry, but also in fiction and across the arts and philosophy. In this course, we're going to cast a measured, critical eye over every part of this received account. In units on spontaneity, consciousness, the sensible body, and modern theories of emotion, we will set this literary movement in the historical, literary and intellectual contexts from which it emerged. We will read widely; highlights will likely include, in part or in whole, William Wordsworth's 1798 &quot;Prelude&quot;, Charlotte Smith's Elegiac Sonnets, Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.", "name": "Studies in Romantic Literature", "section": "20", "topic": "Romanticism and Feeling", "course": "353-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENGLISH/353-0/23930", "instructor": ["Nicholas Pardee Valvo"], "id": "23930", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
