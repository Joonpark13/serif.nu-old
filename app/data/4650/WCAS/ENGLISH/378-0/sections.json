Her current book project, The Afterlife of Illness, examines the largely-forgotten history of convalescent caregiving in Victorian Britain in order to theorize a historical reading practice that resisted narrative closure. Professor Krienke has taught courses in both the Feinberg School of Medicine and the Northwestern English Department, where she received a teaching award. In her courses, Professor Krienke aims to foster multi-disciplinary conversations that bridge the structural gap in the university between the humanities and the sciences."}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENGLISH/378-0/23936", "instructor": ["Hosanna Grace Krienke"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "23936", "subject": "ENGLISH"}, {"class_mtg_info": [{"meet_t": "MoWe 12:30PM - 1:50PM", "meet_l": "Parkes Hall 223"}], "school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The period between the 1820s and the 1860s has traditionally been called the \"American Renaissance\": a time when the U.S. nation, and its literature, flourished.
