However, the act of writing remained a vexed vocation for women in this period. On the one hand, women writers were able to capitalize on the stereotype of feminine virtue to voice strident critiques of the status quo. On the other hand, women's writing was often treated as a niche market assumed to be read exclusively by other women. In this class, we will examine how women writers depict the act of writing and, by extension, the role of women in intervening in public and political discourse. Crucially, we will also examine differences among this cohort of writers, including the racial and class differences that produced divergent visions for the role of women in the public sphere."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar Discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation and three papers: two short close-readings and one longer argument paper."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), Harriet Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861), Louisa May Alcott's Hospital Sketches (1863) and Little Women (1868-9), and Nineteenth-Century Women Writers: An Anthology."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Instructor Bio: Hosanna Krienke's research combines narrative theory with the history of science and medicine. Her current book project, The Afterlife of Illness, examines the largely-forgotten history of convalescent caregiving in Victorian Britain in order to theorize a historical reading practice that resisted narrative closure. Professor Krienke has taught courses in both the Feinberg School of Medicine and the Northwestern English Department, where she received a teaching award. In her courses, Professor Krienke aims to foster multi-disciplinary conversations that bridge the structural gap in the university between the humanities and the sciences."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:57 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
