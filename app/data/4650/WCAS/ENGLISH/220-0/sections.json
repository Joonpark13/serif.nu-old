Since time will not permit a complete reading of the Bible, we will concentrate on those books that display the greatest literary interest and/or historical influence: Genesis, Exodus, Ruth, Job, selected Psalms, Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and Isaiah; the Gospels according to Matthew and John, and the Book of Revelation (Apocalypse).
