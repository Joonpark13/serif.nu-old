[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar will read travel narratives, natural philosophy, and fiction spanning the late seventeenth through the early nineteenth century. Our primary interest will be these texts' intersecting constructions of gendered and ethno-geographical (hereafter \"racial\") difference. To establish our methodological and historical coordinates, we'll read excerpts from Judith Butler's Gender Trouble and Bodies that Matter alongside seventeenth-century natural history to think about the critical stakes of \"race\" and gender at a time when neither category was essentially fixed. Due to the rise of empirical philosophy and science, which strongly rejected neo-Aristotelian notions of essence, \"race\" and, to some extent, gender were derived from relations involving performance, sensory perception, environment, and power. However, the relational production of \"race\" and gender do not divest these attributes of materiality. We will be attentive to how body, rather than a static bearer of qualitative difference, may be implicated in the relational apparition of \"race\" and gender all the way down. This seminar also functions as an introduction to the rise of the novel, with critical attention to the interplay between novel and travel narrative.", "name": "18Th Cent Lit", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 018 English", "topic": "Long 18 C Constructions of Race and Gender", "course": "441-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENGLISH/441-0/23987", "instructor": ["Helen F Thompson"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "23987", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
