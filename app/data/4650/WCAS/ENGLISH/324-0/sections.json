[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The art of life-writing is perennially popular, yet its conventions have changed much over time. In this class we will consider a range of medieval ideas about the self and reasons for writing about oneself, principally with God as a witness. Our period begins with the first Western autobiography, Augustine's Confessions (5th c.), and ends with the first autobiography in English, the Book of Margery Kempe (15th c.). In between we will read examples of spiritual and erotic autobiography as well as literary confessions by Chaucer, Langland, Hoccleve, and Christine de Pizan. Some of the fascinating characters we will meet include Hermann of Scheda, a Jewish convert to Christianity; Hildegard of Bingen, a visionary prophet; the lovers Abelard and Heloise, Dante and Beatrice; and the poet-bureaucrat Thomas Hoccleve, struggling to overcome the stigma of a mental breakdown.", "name": "Studies in Medieval Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Parkes Hall 223", "topic": "Medieval Autobiography", "course": "324-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENGLISH/324-0/23926", "instructor": ["Barbara Jane   Newman"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "23926", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
