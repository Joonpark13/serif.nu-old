In a democracy - or on a college campus - does diversity enhance community, or challenge it? And how have the community or communities where you grew up affected your sense of identity? In this course, we will explore these questions by examining (a) the different ways that people collect information about community and identity and (b) how they express their ideas through various genres, such as personal narratives, academic studies, and news articles. As you hone your skills in writing, research, and critical thinking, we will consider the impact that histories and institutions have had on communities and individuals, particularly with regard to the US criminal justice system. Finally, you will complete a project related to community and diversity in a field of your choice, such as law, medicine, music, religion, public policy, higher education, or others."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion and workshop.
