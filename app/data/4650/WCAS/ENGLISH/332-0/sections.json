[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "What happens when the conceits of poetry - gazes piercing hearts, floods of tears, women with rosy cheeks and pearl-like teeth - are acted out in a play? This course will consider how English Renaissance poetic conventions are worked out and problematized in comedies of the same period. Specifically, we will focus on questions of desire, sexuality, the body, and gender raised by poetic tropes and conventions that the English import and adapt from Petrarch and Ovid. Two themes in particular will continue to surface: (1) representations of the (usually female) body in relation to the male gaze and early modern models of exchange and colonization, and (2) ways that women respond to these figurations of the body in early modern comedies. This course is designed for students to develop a foundation of knowledge with which to recognize poetic conventions and allusions in Renaissance drama and to contextualize these conceits in discourses of desire, love and gender in the Renaissance and contemporary culture.", "name": "Renaissance Drama", "section": "20", "location": "Harris Hall L28", "topic": "Staging Desire in Ren.
