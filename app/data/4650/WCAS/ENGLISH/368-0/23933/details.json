How odd was the world that produced it? To answer these questions, we will look at salient figures from postwar American fiction and their relationship to some of the stranger, most pervasive myths and narratives of the 1950s: the rise of the teenager, the contested space of middlebrow culture, the encroachment of suburbia, and the celebration of the outsider and its concomitant critique of the conformist. The reading list will range from the well-known and the celebrated to works that are just as intriguing but a bit more obscure, so we'll read from Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita, but also his less well-known Pnin, as well as James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room, John Updike's Rabbit, Run, Walker Percy's The Moviegoer, and Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood. We will also look at media that reflect, contest, or complicate these narratives: movies by Nicholas Ray, Douglas Sirk, and others, exploitation and health films, rockabilly and country songs, sitcoms, and Mad Men."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "An individual research paper and a collaborative wiki."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Lolita, Pnin, Giovanni's Room, The Moviegoer, The Dud Avocado, The Haunting of Hill House."}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:59 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
