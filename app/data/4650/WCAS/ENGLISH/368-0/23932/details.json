In the past decade, a number of returning US veterans have published novels and short stories set in Iraq and Afghanistan, many of them ambitious and sophisticated. We will read some of the more provocative and evocative of these literary texts by returning veterans and fiction by Iraqi authors in the wake of the US invasion and occupation. On the US side, the novelists considered both invoke or allude to American fiction of the WWII and Vietnam periods, but also seem to have picked up on, in the most interesting cases, lessons gleaned from postcolonial studies, namely the question of the silenced subaltern subject and the relationship of representation to military/geopolitical occupation. So we will also read major works of literature from WWII and Vietnam, and a selection of essays from postcolonial studies."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar with discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Short paper, presentation, reading quizzes, final paper."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Works by writers such as Gertrude Stein, John Hersey, Min\u00e9 Okubo, Hisaye Yamamoto, Norman Mailer, Gwendolyn Brooks, Joseph Heller, Ralph Ellison, Tim O'Brien, Michael Herr, Siobhan Fallon, Ben Fountain, Phil Klay, Michael Pitre, Elliott Ackerman, Hassan Blassim, Sinan Antoon, Gayatri Spivak, Edward Said, and others.
