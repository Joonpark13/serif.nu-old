[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Why were people serving in the court of Queen Elizabeth obsessed with writing sonnets about the tortuous nature of love? How did poets understand the confusing experience of love by reference to politics, religion, race, nationalism, and gender roles? When were love and desire expressed in ways that cemented social bonds and when was eros, by contrary, an unruly force that seemed to unravel the very fabric of the self? In this course, we will read the love poetry of the English Renaissance, spanning from the court of Henry VIII in the early sixteenth century to verse circulating around the time of the civil war in the mid- seventeenth century. In order to understand the outpouring of great love poetry by writers such as Shakespeare, Sidney, Donne, Marvell, Wroth, and Marlowe, we will delve into religious controversies, court politics, colonialism, same-sex desire, medical theory, rhetoric, portraiture, and inherited literary forms.", "name": "Renaissance Poetry", "section": "20", "topic": "Love in the Age of Shakespeare", "course": "331-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENGLISH/331-0/23927", "instructor": ["Wendy L Wall"], "id": "23927", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
