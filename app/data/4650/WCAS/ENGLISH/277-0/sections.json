[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Is there such a thing as Latino/a literature? If indeed there is, how can we define it and what are its characteristics? Students will read an increasingly diversifying literary corpus that does not necessarily reflects, but invents Latino/a identities and ways of being in the world. We will begin studying Chicano and Nuyorican literary texts from the 1960s and 1970s, and conclude with texts by emerging voices such as H\u00e9ctorTobar and Patricia Engel. Our readings will represent various literary genres, voices, and discourses that exemplify the various styles of writing created by a diverse group of national, ethnic, racial, and gendered subjects. We will emphasize historical continuities since the 1960s and 70s, while also exploring the relationship between genres and emerging social issues. Thus, by the end of the quarter students will have acquired a historical overview of the heterogeneous literary voices and aesthetics that constitute U.S. Latino/a literature as well as an awareness of the internal debates around the creation of a national Latino/a literary canon.", "name": "Introduction to Latina and Latino Literature", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "277-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENGLISH/277-0/24074", "instructor": ["Frances R Aparicio"], "id": "24074", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
