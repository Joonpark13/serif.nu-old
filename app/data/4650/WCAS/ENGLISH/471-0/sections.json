[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The period between 1830 and 1860 was a time of massive social transformation, reformist zeal, and political crisis?a time when the fiction of the American union was breaking up as the linked issues of race, class, gender, capital, technology, imperial expansion, and war exposed major contradictions in the ideology of the American republic. Not coincidentally, these years corresponded with the period of immense literary creativity that F. O. Matthiessen called the \"American Renaissance\" in American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman (1941). This book not only defined a period and a canon (Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman); it also set the critical and evaluative terms within which future readings and interpretations of American literature would occur. This course will focus on selection of antebellum writings and past and recent criticism and theory as a means of engaging critically with the transformations in the field imaginary of American literature that have taken place against the critical methodology, evaluative terms, canonical writers, readings, texts, contexts, and \"boundaries\" set in place by F. O. Matthiessen's now classic study.", "name": "Studies in American Literature", "section": "20", "topic": "American Literature in Theory", "course": "471-0", "meeting_time": ["We 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENGLISH/471-0/23989", "instructor": ["Betsy J Erkkila"], "id": "23989", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
