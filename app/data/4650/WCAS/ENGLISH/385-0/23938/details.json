In this class we will chart a middle course between technophilia and technophobia in order to analyze digital computational technologies analytically and historically from a humanities perspective. We will pay particular attention to aesthetic forms responding to the problem of how digital media enable both unprecedented transparency and opacity: from dataveillance and sharing on social media to glitch art and the oddly impersonal dimensions of networked sexuality. Taking a comparative perspective, we will survey a series of digital aesthetic genres from videogames to glitch video art to electronic literature. Possible objects of study include Thatgamecompany's Journey, David OReilly's Everything, videos by Laura Poitras, Natalie Bookchin, Takeshi Murata, and Lynn Kirby, and e-lit by John Cayley and William Poundstone."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Analytical Essays."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Course Reader."}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:58 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
