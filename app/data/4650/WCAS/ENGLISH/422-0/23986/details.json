Medieval authors did not write &quot;autobiography&quot; in the modern sense, assuming that their personal lives were inherently interesting. But several wrote confessiones, with the double meaning Augustine gave to that term: a confession of sin coupled with a confession of faith and praise to God. Converts used the genre to announce their conversion, prophets to validate their prophetic call, and mystics to share divine revelations and edify their readers. <br/><br/>More overtly literary forms of autobiography emerged in the high Middle Ages. The poets Ulrich von Liechtenstein and Dante crafted prose narratives to frame their love lyrics, inventing the genre of erotic autobiography?comically in Ulrich's case, seriously in Dante's. Finally, such fourteenth- and fifteenth-century writers as Chaucer, Langland, Christine de Pizan, and Thomas Hoccleve skillfully developed literary personas that drew on the confessional genre to situate themselves within their own fictive creations."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "permission of Department required"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "class participation; one 10-minute oral presentation; a short paper; and a term paper of 12-15 pages."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Readings will include <br/>Augustine of Hippo, Confessions; <br/>Guibert of Nogent, Monodiae (Songs for a Solo Voice), Book 1; <br/>Judah/Hermann of Scheda, A Short Work on His Conversion; <br/>Peter Abelard, Story of My Calamities; <br/>Heloise and Abelard, Letters 2-5; <br/>Hildegard of Bingen and Gottfried of St. Disibod, The Life of St. Hildegard, Books 1 and 2; <br/>Ulrich von Liechtenstein, Frauendienst (The Service of Ladies); <br/>Dante Alighieri, Vita Nuova; <br/>Julian of Norwich, A Vision Showed to a Devout Woman (Short Text); <br/>Margery Kempe and Robert Spryngolde, The Book of Margery Kempe; <br/>Geoffrey Chaucer, prologue to The Legend of Good Women; <br/>William Langland, &quot;Apology for his life,&quot; from Piers Plowman, C-text; <br/>Christine de Pizan, prologue to The Book of the City of Ladies; and <br/>Thomas Hoccleve, &quot;My Compleinte.&quot; <br/><br/>We will also read criticism by Evelyn Birge Vitz, John Fleming, A.
