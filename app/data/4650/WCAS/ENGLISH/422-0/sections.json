[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The art of life-writing is perennially popular, yet its conventions have changed much over time. Medieval authors did not write \"autobiography\" in the modern sense, assuming that their personal lives were inherently interesting. But several wrote confessiones, with the double meaning Augustine gave to that term: a confession of sin coupled with a confession of faith and praise to God. Converts used the genre to announce their conversion, prophets to validate their prophetic call, and mystics to share divine revelations and edify their readers. <br/><br/>More overtly literary forms of autobiography emerged in the high Middle Ages. The poets Ulrich von Liechtenstein and Dante crafted prose narratives to frame their love lyrics, inventing the genre of erotic autobiography?comically in Ulrich's case, seriously in Dante's. Finally, such fourteenth- and fifteenth-century writers as Chaucer, Langland, Christine de Pizan, and Thomas Hoccleve skillfully developed literary personas that drew on the confessional genre to situate themselves within their own fictive creations.", "name": "Studies in Medieval Literature", "section": "20", "topic": "Medieval Autobiography", "course": "422-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENGLISH/422-0/23986", "instructor": ["Barbara Jane   Newman"], "id": "23986", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
