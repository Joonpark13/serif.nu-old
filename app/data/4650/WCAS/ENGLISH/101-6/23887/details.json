Films will likely include Vertigo, Psycho and North by Northwest. The last third of the class will focus on Hitchcock's legacy and influence, e.g. Chris Marker's La Jet\u00e9e and John Carpenter's Halloween. Our primary focus, however, will always lie with attending to the ways film style affects the treatment of key themes across Hitchcock's filmography: from mistaken identity and sexual politics to horror and voyeurism. Assignments will include short essays and several digital editing projects including making animated .gifs and supercuts. No prior technical experience will be presumed."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Several analytical papers and experimental digital editing projects plus class participation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "A course reader."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:57 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
