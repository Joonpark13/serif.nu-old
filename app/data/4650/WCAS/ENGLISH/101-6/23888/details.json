Audiences may inhabit a story through trading fan theories online, dressing up for comic-book conventions, or buying branded products. This course examines the history of such strategies of audience participation, beginning with the rise of a mass reading public in nineteenth century and tracing such collective reception today. In the Victorian era, sensation and detective fiction pioneered new relationships with audiences through such strategies as the suspense of serialized episodes, the pacing of shocking cliffhangers, and the consumption of spin-off merchandise. We will examine how texts manipulate mass audiences through formal structures in order to surprise readers or subvert their expectations. Conversely, we will also study how mass audiences help produce the texts they read?for example, when famous characters like Sherlock Holmes take on a life outside their original texts. By theorizing a dynamic relationship between audiences and texts, this course will prepare you for your own role as a thoughtful participant of popular culture, one who can craft close-readings, amass evidence, and interact with diverse interpretations."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Close Reading Paper 15%; Argument Paper 25%; Research Paper 30%; Oral Presentation 10%; In-Class Participation 20%.<br/><br/>3-4 page close reading paper, 6-7 page argument essay, 8-9 page research."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret (1862), Wilkie Collins's The Moonstone (1868), Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes (selected stories), Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None (1939), Joss Whedon's Serenity (2005), Passthebechdeltest.com, selections from J.K.
