Readings will range from discussions of the graphic novel to considerations of how everyday citizens manipulate social media to tell the stories they desire. We will also look at case studies that illustrate how the ever-widening gulf between the stories told by specialists and non-specialists plays out in the public sphere and the making of public policy. <br/>This course is recommended for students who wish to refine their mastery of the essay form while experimenting with a range of creative approaches to articulating arguments and persuading audiences. Key assignments will require research into a question of the student's own choosing, refined and developed over the course of the quarter. Students are welcome to use this class to deepen their explorations of research problems that they may have begun investigating in other classes or contexts.", "name": "Intermediate Composition", "section": "21", "topic": "From Story to Argument", "course": "205-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENGLISH/205-0/25078", "instructor": ["Kathleen   Carmichael"], "id": "25078", "subject": "ENGLISH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The philosophy behind this course, to use Donald Hall's words, is that \"reading well precedes writing well.\" Students will read exemplary models of expository prose as a way of provoking ideas and encouraging effective written communication.<br/> <br/><br/>PROJECTS: Students will write and have the opportunity to revise 3 or 4 essays; individual conferences and workshops will encourage the writing process.", "name": "Intermediate Composition", "section": "22", "topic": "", "course": "205-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENGLISH/205-0/25079", "instructor": ["Marcia B Gealy"], "id": "25079", "subject": "ENGLISH"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The philosophy behind this course, to use Donald Hall's words, is that \"reading well precedes writing well.\" Students will read exemplary models of expository prose as a way of provoking ideas and encouraging effective written communication.<br/> <br/><br/>PROJECTS: Students will write and have the opportunity to revise 3 or 4 essays; individual conferences and workshops will encourage the writing process.", "name": "Intermediate Composition", "section": "23", "topic": "", "course": "205-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENGLISH/205-0/25080", "instructor": ["Marcia B Gealy"], "id": "25080", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
