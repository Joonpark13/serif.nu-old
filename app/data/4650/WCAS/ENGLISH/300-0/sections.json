She also studies and teaches about modern-day adaptations of Medieval and Renaissance texts, as well as the history of gender and sexuality. Most of all, Dr. Fall is interested in exploring how pre-modern literature can help us understand the world today. She has worked as a PreAmble Scholar at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater since 2014."}], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENGLISH/300-0/23922", "instructor": ["Rebecca Lynn Fall"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "23922", "subject": "ENGLISH"}, {"class_mtg_info": [{"meet_t": "TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM", "meet_l": "University Hall 018 English"}], "school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Edgar Allan Poe invented the short story, the detective story, the science fiction story, and modern poetic theory.

This course will focus on Poe's writings as a means of learning how to read and analyze a variety of literary genres, including lyric and narrative poems, the novel, the short story, detective fiction, science fiction, the essay, the literary review, and critical theory. We shall study poetic language, image, meter, and form as well as various story-telling techniques such as narrative point of view, plot, structure, language, character, repetition and recurrence, and implied audience. We shall also study a variety of critical approaches to reading and interpreting Poe's writings, including formalist, psychoanalytic, historicist, Marxist, feminist, queer, critical race, poststructuralist, and postcolonial theory and criticism.
