Where does comedy end and absurdity?or tragedy?begin? What can comedy teach us about society? What might it reveal about history? In this seminar, we will probe these questions as we examine theories and examples of comedy from across the ages. Focusing in particular on comedy in the English Renaissance and modern Anglo-American culture, we will consider how comedy has developed through time and how historical circumstances influence the ways humor is valued, used, and defined within a society. How, for example, does Shakespeare's Much Ado about Nothing compare with Seinfeld, the so-called &quot;show about nothing&quot;? What is similar or dissimilar about the ways the television show 30 Rock and the Renaissance play Knight of the Burning Pestle approach &quot;meta-comedy&quot;? Throughout the course, we will practice close-reading skills and pay special attention to how style, language, subject matter, and unspoken assumptions make jokes funny."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Regular short writing assignments; two formal essays; class participation."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Shakespeare, Much Ado about Nothing and/or Twelfth Night; Beaumont and Fletcher, Knight of the Burning Pestle, Louie, South Park, Key &amp; Peele, Seinfeld, 30 Rock, Aristotle, Freud, and others."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "Notes: English 300 is an English Literature major and minor requirement.

She also studies and teaches about modern-day adaptations of Medieval and Renaissance texts, as well as the history of gender and sexuality. Most of all, Dr. Fall is interested in exploring how pre-modern literature can help us understand the world today. She has worked as a PreAmble Scholar at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater since 2014."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:57 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
