We will apply literary techniques to the composition of short multimedia essays and explore the many ways in which writing with images and sound differs from writing for the page. Like its print counterpart, the video essay is an attempt to see what one thinks about something. The video essay may engage with fact, but tends to be less self-assured than documentary. Rather, the video essay, writes Phillip Lopate, &quot;wears confusion proudly as it gropes toward truth.&quot; Agnes Varda, the poetic French filmmaker who coined the term &quot;cin\u00e9criture,&quot; or film writing, best described the promise of the form when noting that, for her, writing meant more than simply wording a script. Choosing images, designing sound?these, too, were part of that process. At its best, the video essay leverages the visceral power of sound and image, builds a sympathetic resonance with language, and enlivens the senses. The goal of this course is to better understand how the act of writing with media, while still driven by language, is shaped by visual and sonic elements. We will author our own short video essays and will, in the process, learn to record and edit video, produce layered soundscapes, use our voices as tools of performance, and make our films visible to the world."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:57 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
