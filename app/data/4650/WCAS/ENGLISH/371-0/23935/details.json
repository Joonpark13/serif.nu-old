We will operate from two basic points: America can be understood as a text, constantly being rewritten, revised, and contested; and American identity is relational, situated in culture, history, and the body. The questions we will examine include: In a racially and ethnically diverse (even divided) nation, what constitutes American identity, the quality of &quot;Americanness&quot;? Who, if anyone, speaks for all Americans? What sort of literary voice best expresses American realities and ideals? How does the dynamic of culture and counter-culture, dominant and marginal, get worked out aesthetically and ideologically?"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture, discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Brief written responses to each novel and several options for papers."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Twain, Adventures of Huckleberry; Finn; Chopin, The Awakening; Algren, The Man With the Golden Arm; Kerouac, On the Road; Thompson, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas; Morrison, Song of Solomon."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:57 PM (CT)", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
