[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this class, we will examine the related ideas of the Great American Novel and \"the American Dream\" to explore the ongoing construction of American identity, values, and literature. We will operate from two basic points: America can be understood as a text, constantly being rewritten, revised, and contested; and American identity is relational, situated in culture, history, and the body. The questions we will examine include: In a racially and ethnically diverse (even divided) nation, what constitutes American identity, the quality of \"Americanness\"? Who, if anyone, speaks for all Americans? What sort of literary voice best expresses American realities and ideals? How does the dynamic of culture and counter-culture, dominant and marginal, get worked out aesthetically and ideologically?", "name": "American Novel", "section": "20", "location": "Locy Hall 214", "topic": "Defining America", "course": "371-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ENGLISH/371-0/23935", "instructor": ["William J Savage"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "23935", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
