This history has been filled with intimacy, fascination, and integration, on the one hand, and estrangement, exploitation, and misunderstanding, on the other. Dancing bodies both reflected and shaped the complex relationship between the United States and Latin America. Weekly readings include primary documents, secondary sources, and audiovisual materials featuring famous performers in grand theatres and films, social dancers in clubs, ethnographers moving among dancing faithful, frolicking Disney cartoons, and Latin American dancers in Chicago.<br/><br/>There are no prerequisites. All reading materials will be made available on canvas, and/or students will have the option to buy a course packet if they prefer hard copies."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 7:01 PM (CT)", "subject": "LATIN_AM"}]
