[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is an introduction to French culture through an exploration of the facts and fictions behind French nationalism, unity, and identity. How did a nearly-forgotten eleventh-century poem, rediscovered in the nineteenth century, become a standard for French literary, cultural, and ethno-racial identities? This quarter we will explore how medieval literature gets repurposed and reread with the rise of modern nationalism and colonialism. The &quot;medieval,&quot; we will see, is not only far more present than we imagine, it is perhaps even a product of modernity. If the very framing of the Middle Ages has always been a product of imagined rupture between the past and present, paired with a constant re-writing of the very idea of the Middle Ages, how can we read contemporary depictions of medieval life as a reflection on our national, ethnic, and racial identities? If we approach the Middle Ages less as a space of difference, can that help us analyze our present? Conducted entirely in French, the course is designed to increase students' ability to speak, read, and write in French, and improve their aural comprehension. `", "name": "Reading Cultures in French", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "211-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/FRENCH/211-0/24135", "instructor": ["Joseph P Derosier"], "id": "24135", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
