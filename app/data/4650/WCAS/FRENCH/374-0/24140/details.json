The focus will be on four volumes of the Search: Swann's Way, Within a Budding Grove, Sodom and Gomorrah, and Time Regained. We will explore Proust's reinvention of the novel as a form in relation to a number of Proustian problems and themes: his analyses of desire, perversion and sexuality; his reflections on the nature of time and memory; and his exploration of the relationship of art to life. We will also consider Proust's powers as a satirist and critic of ideology, who mercilessly dismantled the individual and collective illusions of his contemporaries."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Required Texts by Marcel Proust (available at Norris Books):<br/>Swann's Way<br/>Within a Budding Grove<br/>Sodom and Gomorrah<br/>Time Regained<br/> <br/>We will be reading the Modern Library Edition of In Search of Lost Time, translated by C.K.
