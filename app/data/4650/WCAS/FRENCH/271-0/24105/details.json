In our discussion of these texts, we will focus on the representations of otherness (through the figure of the stranger or the outsider) and the role of difference, especially in terms of race/ethnicity, class and gender, in shaping the French imaginaire and literary canon. In so doing, we will study examples of several major literary developments in the history of French-language literature, from the philosophical and epistolary novel in the 18th century, to Romanticism, Realism, and the Fantastic in the 19th century, and the roman beur and migrant Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois literature in the 20th century. We will discuss the differences between these texts, and study how these differences relate to the relation between narrative and changing historical and cultural contexts, as well as to differences in narrative techniques and other literary structures. The course will privilege the analysis of style, form, language, and theme. We will also develop the techniques of close reading and detailed critical analysis through class discussion and presentations, the creative/reflective assignment, the analytical essay, and the final examination."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "French 210, French 211, or consent of the instructor"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Class discussion, oral reports, short lectures, writing assignments.
