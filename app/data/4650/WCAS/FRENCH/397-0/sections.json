[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is a course on Guy Debord's analysis of and response to the modern consumer society he saw struggling, already in the 50s and 60s, to extend its culture globally. Debord was deeply concerned with the relations he believed society was installing within human beings, between human beings, and between human beings and things. He was as deeply concerned by the transformations taking place in the cultural sphere, where he believed culture itself, the period's emotional and aesthetic response to the conditions and relations of everyday life, was being appropriated in the service of the emerging consumer society. Debord considered himself at war with society and saw his entire life as a strategy in that war. With others in the group he helped found in 1957, the International Situationists, he developed a radical understanding of the relation between art and culture and of the role intellectuals and artists might play in the cultural revolution he aimed to provoke. Debord was a prolific composer of tracts, articles, reviews, books, memoirs, and films. We focus on him but also read pieces by others in the IS, including Raoul Vaneigem, and Ren\u00e9 Vi\u00e9net.", "name": "Studies in Literature and Culture", "section": "20", "topic": "Debord & the International Situationists", "course": "397-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/FRENCH/397-0/24112", "instructor": ["Jane Bradley   Winston"], "id": "24112", "subject": "FRENCH"}]
