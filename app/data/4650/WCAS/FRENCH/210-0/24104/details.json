Against whom or what does one revolt in modern French literature, and toward what ends? Is revolt an exceptional, deviant, or nihilistic reflex or an essential precondition of modern notions of individuality, freedom, commitment, pleasure, social progress, or even authorship? To what extent does literature provide a privileged vehicle for revolt as the exception to the real? We situate our study in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, an era of great social, political, and cultural change. Through readings of short works by authors such as Hugo, Baudelaire, Camus, Duras, and C\u00e9saire, we explore the meanings attached to various forms of revolt-socio-political, moral, ethical, irrational, existential, and aesthetic- while also considering their ambiguities and paradoxes.
