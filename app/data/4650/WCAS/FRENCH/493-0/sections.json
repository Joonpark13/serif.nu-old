Rather than attempting to cover all the positions and directions that this field has produced, we will work around specific questions and trace the ways in which they have been pursued by theorists and practitioners alike. How can we conceptualize the relation between art and technology? Can we speak of perception and memory independently of specific technical apparatuses? What is at stake in the shift from analog to digital media at the level of both inscription and reception? We will also ask questions of media archeology, and consider a range of pre-twentieth century devices for hearing and seeing. As we focus on different kinds of audiovisual media, we will read texts by T.W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, Friedrich Kittler, Bernard Stiegler, and Samuel Weber. We will also analyze films and art installations by Harun Farocki, Martin Arnold, and Pierre Huyghe.", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "Topics in Literary Theory", "title": "WCAS FRENCH 493-0-20 Topics in Literary Theory", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:43 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-8269", "instructor_name": "Domietta   Torlasco", "instructor_addr": "1860 S.
