How do these categories reflect and inscribe inequality as well as group consciousness and struggle? What are the mechanisms that maintain racial inequalities? How have black populations questioned, practiced, analyzed, and struggled with and against these categories and their effects. These questions guide our reading of major texts from the fields of political science, history, law, anthropology, and sociology, among others. The readings address the topics of race and blackness, politics, culture, class, social movements, gender, and inequality. Emphasis will be on empirical explorations of black communities and the societies in which they are embedded, both inside and outside of the U.S. Each class session will involve brief introductory comments, and then in-depth discussion lead by assigned facilitators."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar style, student facilitators and discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation - 20%<br/>Leading seminar - 20%<br/>Midterm paper - 20%<br/>Final paper - 40%"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "1 book and several chapters per week.
