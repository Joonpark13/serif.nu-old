[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course introduces students to a broad overview of African American history from Emancipation to the present. In this class, we will examine African Americans' pursuit of freedom and justice as defined in different eras and their attempts at forging a cultural identity within the United States and across the African diaspora. Key themes for this course will include the impact of national and international politics on black communities, the role of intersecting identity categories in complicating the notion of a single \"black experience,\" and the efficacy of different tools and tactics for political and personal expression. By the end of this quarter, students will understand some of the important concepts and movements that shaped the last 150 years of African American history.", "name": "Introduction to African American History: Emancipation to Civil Rights Movement", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "212-2", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/AF_AM_ST/212-2/21745", "instructor": ["Melanie Lee Chambliss"], "id": "21745", "subject": "AF_AM_ST"}]
