Topics include the political development of racial census classifications, the New Deal and the emergence of the welfare state, criminal justice and mass incarceration, neoliberalism and poverty governance, and affirmative action policies and jurisprudence. Ultimately, we will examine the ways that the state and its political institutions actively produce categories of race, class, and gender, transform their meanings, and redefine their relationships to democratic ideals and prevailing models of U.S. politics and citizenship."}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "AF_AM_ST"}]
