We will discuss statistical estimation and inferential techniques such as least-squares, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests, regarding both the regression parameters and the error variance. We will study the regression models by specifying what the underlying assumptions are, how to check them through diagnostics, and how to build models based on data.<br/><br/>Homework will be assigned weekly or biweekly (about 7 assignments).
