Recognize the importance of data collection, identify limitations in data collection methods, and determine how they affect the scope of inference.<br/>2. Use statistical software to summarize data numerically and visually, and to perform data analysis.<br/>3. Have a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference.<br/>4. Apply estimation and testing methods to analyze single variables or the relationship between two variables in order to understand natural phenomena and make data-based decisions.<br/>5.
