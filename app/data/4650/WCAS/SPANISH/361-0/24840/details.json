In the first half of the course, we will trace social/political/cultural crisis, change, and status quo in three units on Revolution, the status of the indigenous from post-revolution to the 2014 disappearance of forty-three students in Ayotzinapa, and, finally, the middle class, modernity, and Tlatelolco (the famous residential complex and the infamous 1968 massacre that took place therein). In the second half of the course, students will take charge of the syllabus in small groups, each group selecting a film (or relevant cultural text) for study by the class and then teaching that text in a class session dedicated to its study. Throughout the semester, we will focus on creating a composite portrait of Mexico through the cultural content we study, and we will focus on strengthening our skills of critical analysis. Although narrative film will be our principal medium of study, we will also see documentary film, read short stories (of relevant content and/or the original texts of filmic adaptations), analyze art (muralism and canvas painting), consider architecture as a cultural text (the Nonoalco-Tlatelolco residential complex in Mexico City), follow journalistic coverage of Ayotzinapa (The New Yorker and Mexican press), learn about the political movement known as the &quot;Mexican Spring,&quot; and see music videos. As we move through our diverse topics and media, we will focus on identifying and maintaining the critical through lines of unifying themes and symbols within Mexican cultural production and discourse.<br/><br/><br/>Films/texts/topics may include:<br/>Fernando de Fuentes, V\u00e1monos con Pancho Villa (1936)<br/>Muralism of Diego Rivera (c. 1930)<br/>Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez, Mar\u00eda Candelaria (1944)<br/>Alejandro Galindo, Una familia de tantas (1948)<br/>Juan Rulfo, &quot;Nos han dado la tierra&quot; (El llano en llamas, 1953)<br/>Luis Bu\u00f1uel, El \u00e1ngel exterminador (1962)<br/>Jorge Ibarg\u00fcengoitia, &quot;La ley de Herodes&quot; (1967)<br/>Raymundo Gleyzer, M\u00e9xico: la revoluci\u00f3n congelada (1970)<br/>Jorge Fons, Rojo amanecer (1990)<br/>EZLN (1994)<br/>Luis Estrada, La ley de Herodes (1999)<br/>Fernando Eimbcke, Temporada de patos (2004)<br/>Rigoberto P\u00e9rezcano, Norteado (2009)<br/>Carlos Reygadas, &quot;Este es mi reino&quot; (2010)<br/>#yosoy132 (2012)<br/>Michel Franco, Despu\u00e9s de Luc\u00eda (2012)<br/>Shaul Schwarz, Narco Cultura (2013)<br/>Ayotzinapa (2014)<br/>&quot;Todos somos mexicanos&quot; (2015)"}], "lmod": "12/25/16 7:08 PM (CT)", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
