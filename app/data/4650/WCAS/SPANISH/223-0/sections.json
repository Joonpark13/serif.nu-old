[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is taught in English.<br/><br/>Introduction to Don Quijote and other selected works, with attention to the historical and cultural context of the 17th century.<br/><br/>Why did Dostoevsky call Don Quixote \"the final and greatest utterance of the human mind,\" and Cervantes \"the great poet and seer of the human heart\"? Why did George Washington buy a Don Quixote on the same date the U.S. Constitution was approved and keep the book on his library's table? Why has Cervantes impacted film, art, music and language so deeply? How does Don Quixote examine Historical and Religious issues (the sixteenth and seventeenth century struggle between Christianity and Islam), Philosophy (Does human freedom exist?), Politics (What is a Just War?), Economics (Is government intervention in the market beneficial?) and the nature and value of literature? Why has Don Quixote been voted by both critics and novelists as the most important work of fiction ever written? Join teaching-award winner professor Dario Fernandez-Morera to try to answer these and other questions in a course open to all students.", "name": "Cervantes", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "223-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/SPANISH/223-0/24818", "instructor": ["Dario   Fernandez-Morera"], "id": "24818", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
