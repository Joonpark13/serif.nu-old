It also produced painters such as El Greco and Diego de Silva y Velazquez, musicians such as Tomas de Victoria, pioneers in international law such as Francisco de Vitoria, economists who anticipated Adam Smith, thinkers on freedom and slavery, great architects, and much more. We will read Lazarillo de Tormes, the first picaresque novel, short novels by Cervantes, and selected poems from various Golden Age poets. We will use films, music, and videos that will help get an idea of Spanish Golden Age Civilization.
