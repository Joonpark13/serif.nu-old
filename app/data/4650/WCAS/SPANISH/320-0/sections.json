[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This class will examine selected short novels and poetry from what is arguably the most brilliant period of Spanish civilization, the so-called Spanish Golden Age, which produced such writers as Miguel de Cervantes, Garcilaso de la Vega, St. John of the Cross, St. Theresa of Avila, Fray Luis de Leon, Francisco de Quevedo, Lope de Vega, Tirso de Molina, and Calderon de la Barca. It also produced painters such as El Greco and Diego de Silva y Velazquez, musicians such as Tomas de Victoria, pioneers in international law such as Francisco de Vitoria, economists who anticipated Adam Smith, thinkers on freedom and slavery, great architects, and much more. We will read Lazarillo de Tormes, the first picaresque novel, short novels by Cervantes, and selected poems from various Golden Age poets. We will use films, music, and videos that will help get an idea of Spanish Golden Age Civilization. There will be a class project (leading to a paper), a midterm, and a class presentation on the student project.", "name": "Golden Age Poetry and Prose", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "320-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 12:00PM - 12:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/SPANISH/320-0/24825", "instructor": ["Dario   Fernandez-Morera"], "id": "24825", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
