We will take an historical view of the Jews of Spain from the early Roman settlements to the 2014 announcement of citizenship for descendants of the Jews expelled from Spain in 1492. Alongside this historical analysis, we will look at the cultural production of the Judeo-Spanish population, including the poetry of Judah Ha-Levi (c. 1075-1141), narratives surrounding the 1492 Expulsion, and contemporary Ladino music."}], "lmod": "12/25/16 7:07 PM (CT)", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
