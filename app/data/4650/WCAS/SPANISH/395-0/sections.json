[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This seminar explores diverse representations of the body in Latin American Culture with a focus on the present moment. We will use fictional and theoretical texts, films, videos, music, cartoons, and visual artworks to examine different bodies, both canonical and marginalized, in direct relationship to their class, race, and sexuality. Goals of the course include: interrogating these bodies in a way that does not take the binary opposition of sex as fixed; questioning their mobility and materiality; and revealing the metaphors at work within them.", "name": "Topics in Latin American, Latina and Latino, and/or Iberian Cultures", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 2:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/SPANISH/395-0/24827", "instructor": ["Nathalie   Bouzaglou"], "id": "24827", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
