We will use fictional and theoretical texts, films, videos, music, cartoons, and visual artworks to examine different bodies, both canonical and marginalized, in direct relationship to their class, race, and sexuality. Goals of the course include: interrogating these bodies in a way that does not take the binary opposition of sex as fixed; questioning their mobility and materiality; and revealing the metaphors at work within them."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 7:06 PM (CT)", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
