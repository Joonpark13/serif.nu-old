[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Some critics have suggested that the Latin American short story in the twentieth century might have made an even more significant contribution to world literature than the celebrated novels of the Boom (1960s- 1970s). For example, the argument goes, it is Jorge Luis Borges's short fiction that actually initiates the \"new\" narrative currents with which Latin American literature has become identified since the sixties. Likewise, one might argue that it is Julio Cort\u00e1zar's short fiction-even more than his \"revolutionary\" novels-that will stand the test of time. Indeed, these and other well-known writers associated with the \"g\u00e9nero fant\u00e1stico\" (e.g., Horacio Quiroga, Luisa Valenzuela, Rosario Ferr\u00e9) are among the \"masters\" of the Latin American short story who have taught us new ways to read and think about narrative more generally. Within the context of the Latin American tradition, we will focus on the short story as it has been written and theorized by Latin American writers, considering as well proposals from beyond the region (e.g., Poe) and reading models offered by literary critics and theorists of narrative fiction and the fantastic. Where possible, film adaptations of works will be incorporated into discussion. Emphasis will be on close reading and analysis throughout the course.", "name": "Readings in Latin American Short Fiction", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "348-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/SPANISH/348-0/24848", "instructor": ["Lucille   Kerr"], "id": "24848", "subject": "SPANISH"}]
