This course will trace the utopian desires and dystopian anxieties running through Caribbean literary discourse and cultural production in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. We will begin our exploration in the early twentieth-century, when writers in the Hispanic Caribbean looked at both literature and the nation as spaces with utopian potential, even as they were also sites of post-colonial anxieties. We will then move to examine the particular utopian discourse articulated by the Cuban Revolution, as well as the ways in which that discourse has been challenged by both subsequent events (the so-called Special Period) as well as literary and intellectual interventions within Cuba and abroad. The course will end by exploring how utopia and dystopia have been employed to construct and describe spaces of communitarian identity, to name and engage with processes of disempowerment, exclusion, or dehumanization, and to (re)negotiate the region's relationship to temporality. Readings will include works by Miguel de Carri\u00f3n, Jorge Ma\u00f1ach, Luis Pal\u00e9s Matos, Antonio Pereira, Reinaldo Arenas, Antonio Jos\u00e9 Ponte, Reina Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, Michel Encinosa Fu, Jorge Enrique Lage, Luis Negr\u00f3n, Eduardo Lalo, and Rita Indiana Hern\u00e1ndez, as well as the cinematic work of Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea and Sara G\u00f3mez. Critical and theoretical readings will draw on the work of Ernst Bloch, \u00c9douard Glissant, Antonio Ben\u00edtez Rojo, Fredric Jameson, Jos\u00e9 Esteban M\u00fa\u00f1oz, and Sylvia Wynter, among others.
