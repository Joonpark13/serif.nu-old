The overall course goal is to understand the concepts of physical chemistry at a deep enough level to appreciate the relationships between many chemical and materials properties. The course will also provide the background necessary for upper level courses such as organic chemistry and biology. The course title, &quot;Accelerated Physical Chemistry&quot; implies a faster coverage of standard freshman chemistry concepts and a more advanced and quantitative treatment of some important topics. Typically there are three lectures each week plus a discussion class and a laboratory lecture. Special focus is given to energy and the tools of analytical chemistry."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Preqrequisite: Grade of C- or better in Chemistry 171-0 and Chemistry 181-0<br/><br/>Students enrolled in Chem 172-0 must also enroll in Chem 182-0."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "1. &quot;Chemical Principles&quot; by Atkins and Jones, Freeman, 7th Edition"}], "lmod": "12/25/16 6:57 PM (CT)", "subject": "CHEM"}]
