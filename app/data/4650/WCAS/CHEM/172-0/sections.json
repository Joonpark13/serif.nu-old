[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This is the second quarter of the Accelerated General Chemistry sequence. The overall course goal is to understand the concepts of physical chemistry at a deep enough level to appreciate the relationships between many chemical and materials properties. The course will also provide the background necessary for upper level courses such as organic chemistry and biology. The course title, \"Accelerated Physical Chemistry\" implies a faster coverage of standard freshman chemistry concepts and a more advanced and quantitative treatment of some important topics. Typically there are three lectures each week plus a discussion class and a laboratory lecture. Special focus is given to energy and the tools of analytical chemistry.", "name": "Accelerated General Physical Chemistry", "section": "01", "location": "Tech Institute Lecture Room 3", "topic": "", "course": "172-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeThFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/CHEM/172-0/25115", "instructor": ["Toru   Shiozaki"], "class_attributes": "Natural Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "25115", "subject": "CHEM"}]
