[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this topics class we will cover the physical, inorganic and organic chemistry approaches to understanding biology of the cell. Topics in this overview of chemical biology intracellular signaling and signaling pathways, ligand-receptor interactions, inorganic physiology, post-translational modifications, molecular probe design for biological targets, glycobiology, molecular imaging techniques and translation science. In the second half of the class, students will learn how to prepare, present and evaluate NIH R01 style research proposals.
