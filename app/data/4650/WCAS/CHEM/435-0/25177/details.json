Emphasis will be placed on promising emerging science and technology, including that associated with organic photovoltaics, solid-state dye cells, and photo-catalytic and electro-catalytic materials for water splitting. Depending on interest, other topics such as thermoelectrics, thermal-solar water splitting, biofuels, or redox flow batteries and other electrical energy storage technologies may be discussed. The course will be taught at the beginning-graduate-student/upper-level-undergraduate-student level."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Materials will be provided by the instructor."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:56 PM (CT)", "subject": "CHEM"}]
