In addition, you will learn instrumental analysis techniques relevant to analysis of samples in materials chemistry. These techniques will include X-ray crystallography, solid state NMR spectroscopy, electrochemistry, atomic spectroscopy, and a variety of polymer characterization techniques (MALDI-TOF MS, NMR spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, DSC). Some of these analytical techniques may be used to analyze the inorganic samples you prepare in the course."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites: Chem 333 and Chem 350-1 or equivalent; Chem 342-2 corequisite"}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:56 PM (CT)", "subject": "CHEM"}]
