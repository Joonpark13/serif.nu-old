As the flip side of our desire to see, exhibitionism manifests the desire to be seen, to expose oneself to the look of others to turn oneself into a spectacle in both the private and public spheres. While drawing from the fields of cinema and media studies, we will analyze how film, television, and social media have simultaneously reflected and constructed our desire for self-display. We will pay particular attention to questions of gender and sexuality and to the ways in which spectacle and politics have joined forces at different junctures in Italian history. Among the films we will study are Luchino Visconti's Bellissima (1951), Federico Fellini's La dolce vita (1960) and Ginger and Fred (1986), Erik Gandini's Videocracy (2009), Matteo Garrone's Reality (2012), and Paolo Sorrentino's La grande bellezza (2013).", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "First-Year Seminar", "title": "WCAS ITALIAN 105-6-20 First-Year Seminar", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:45 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "847/491-8269", "instructor_name": "Domietta   Torlasco", "instructor_addr": "1860 S.
