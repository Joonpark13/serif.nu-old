At the end of the sequence, students are able to ask and answer simple questions in Italian, write a grammatically correct sentence, and follow the drift of a simple conversation. The emphasis is on person-to-person communication. Students build grammar skills by working on simple situations - greetings, introductions, asking directions - that grow in complexity as the course proceeds. Classes are conducted entirely in Italian and include a wide range of exercises, small-group projects, video, and Internet sites. Students also gain knowledge of fundamental aspects of Italian culture, history, and geography. Weinberg students with some experience in Italian may take an exam to place out of any or all of the first-year sequence. Courses may be taken individually (subject to prerequisites) or in sequence."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Avanti! 3rd edition (Textbook+workbook)"}], "lmod": "12/24/16 7:03 PM (CT)", "subject": "ITALIAN"}]
