At the end of full-year Italian 101 sequence, students will be able to ask and answer simple questions in Italian, write a grammatically correct sentence, and follow the drift of a simple conversation. Students will gain knowledge of fundamental aspects of Italian culture, history, and geography. The emphasis is on interpersonal communication. We build grammar skills by working on simple situations that grow in complexity as we proceed: greetings, talking about ourselves, asking others, performing tasks. Classes are conducted entirely in Italian and are very lively, with lots of give-and-take among participants. <br/>Italian 101-2 is the second in a three-part sequence for beginning students of Italian."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Italian 101-1 or equivalent."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Communicative method.
