But the problem of implicit bias - of certain people being perceived as less authoritative, knowledgeable, or capable based on their gender, race, or other bodily marker of difference - is pervasive in and beyond STEM. It also has deep historical roots. This first-year seminar explores the gendering of science since the Middle Ages in order to shed light on this contemporary problem. Through a series of case studies drawn from European and U.S. history, we will explore the many ways in which cultural norms about sex/gender have shaped scientific thought and practice. Topics to be covered include: the science of sex and race; gendered hierarchies in the lab, field, and other sites of science; the invisible work of women as assistants, wives and daughters, and scientific test subjects; and the way that changing cultural assumptions about sex/gender and race have influenced the shifting demographics of STEM fields over time."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "DiscussionReadingsWriting assignments"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationPaper, final: (synthetic essay, 6-8 pgs.)<br/>Papers: (two short papers, 3-5 pgs.)<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted on Norris website***<br/>Charles Darwin.
