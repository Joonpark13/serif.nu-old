[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "A long-standing stereotype of Africa as a place of violence exists. A definition of violence may seem obvious-violence is bodily harm and its aftermaths wrought by one or more persons against one more others. But the definition masks the moral struggles over questions of the legitimacy of violence. Because violence involves at least three, sometimes overlapping, perspectives: perpetrators, victims, and witnesses, explaining its causes and consequences of violence must address historically specific dimensions of motivation and constraint. With this approach to violence we can think about the ways in which struggles over the morality and legitimacy of force shaped both new and enduring forms of violence in African history. We'll work our way toward answers-actually, better questions are better than answers-by considering slavery and slave trading in West Africa, imperial conquest and colonial power in East Africa, and genocidal violence in Rwanda.", "name": "First-Year Seminar-Non-Western History", "section": "20", "topic": "Violence and African History", "course": "103-6", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/HISTORY/103-6/21951", "instructor": ["David Lee   Schoenbrun"], "id": "21951", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
