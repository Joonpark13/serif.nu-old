Its foreign relations are thus a matter of interest, not only as part of U.S. history, but also as part of global history. This upper-level lecture course considers the rise of the United States and asks how the U.S. came to be the sort of world power it is today. The course is not, however, merely a history of wars and diplomacy. It is also a history of ideas, social movements, technologies, and globalization. Special attention will be given to the themes of race, empire, and democracy as we follow the story of U.S. foreign relations from 1789 to the present."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion sectionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Exam, finalExam, mid-termResearch project: (Research Paper)<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted to Norris website***<br/>Campbell Craig and Fredrik Logevall, America's Cold War: The Politics of Insecurity. 9780674064065.<br/>William Lederer and Eugene Burdick, The Ugly American. 9780393318678."}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Americas"}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:59 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
