[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The United States has been, since at least 1945, the most powerful nation on the planet. Its foreign relations are thus a matter of interest, not only as part of U.S. history, but also as part of global history. This upper-level lecture course considers the rise of the United States and asks how the U.S. came to be the sort of world power it is today. The course is not, however, merely a history of wars and diplomacy. It is also a history of ideas, social movements, technologies, and globalization. Special attention will be given to the themes of race, empire, and democracy as we follow the story of U.S. foreign relations from 1789 to the present.", "name": "History of US Foreign Relations", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "319-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/HISTORY/319-0/21978", "instructor": ["Daniel Sepinuck Immerwahr"], "id": "21978", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
