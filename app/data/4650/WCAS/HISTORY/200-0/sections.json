[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this course we will explore the life and times of Alexander Hamilton?both the man and the musical. Easily among the most polarizing figures of a famously polarized generation, Hamilton was a Caribbean-born immigrant who became an American revolutionary, a &quot;bastard brat&quot; who became Treasury Secretary, a man who helped to lead thirteen of Britain's American colonies in a violent independence war only to advocate a financial plan and a foreign policy that presented Britain as a role model. If Hamilton helped to revolutionize his country, meanwhile, Lin Manuel Miranda's musical has revolutionized the genre of the Broadway musical and become a national sensation. Why has it captured so many people's imaginations? Where does the show diverge from the history, and what does that say about our memory and use of the past? What might it teach us about early America?and about ourselves?", "name": "New Introductory Courses in History", "section": "1", "topic": "Hamilton's America", "course": "200-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 2:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/HISTORY/200-0/25651", "instructor": ["Geraldo L Cadava", "Caitlin Annette Fitz"], "id": "25651", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
