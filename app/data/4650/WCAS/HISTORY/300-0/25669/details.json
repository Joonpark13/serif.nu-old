The region comprises eleven modern nation-states: its history can seem like a bewildering parade of princes, plenipotentiaries, presidents, and prime ministers. This course focuses, therefore, on the economic and social changes that have spanned the region in the past two hundred and fifty years. Topics include pre-colonial social structures and their relationship to patterns of economic activity; Southeast Asians' responses to the challenges and opportunities of their region's integration with new markets during the era of &quot;high colonialism&quot;; peasant rebellions and the birth of communism; urbanization and religious change; and the social transformations that followed from depression and war in the middle of the twentieth century."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion sectionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationDiscussion sectionPaper, finalPapers: (Source Analysis)<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted to Norris website***<br/>Michael Adas.
