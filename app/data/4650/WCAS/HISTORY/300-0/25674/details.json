Emerging at that time in the private schools of upper class England, soccer quickly spread across the globe following patterns of trade, colonization, and war. As soon as it appeared, the game became enmeshed in debates about race, class, ethnicity, gender, and political and social economy. This entrenchment carries through to today and provides a rich field for historical inquiry."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Attendance: 10%<br/>Class participation: 10%<br/>Papers: (primary source analysis) 15%<br/>Project, final: (history of major soccer event/club/federation) 20%<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "value": "Peter Alegi.
