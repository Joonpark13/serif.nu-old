Saudi Arabia?perhaps the most important country in the Arab world today?will receive particular attention, but the course will also cover Yemen, the Sultanate of Oman and the smaller states of the Persian Gulf (Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates). Moreover, the lectures will address a number of issues that have transnational significance, including: the Saudi conquests since the late 18th century; European colonialism in the Arabian Peninsula; tribalism and state formation; the discovery of oil and its impact; political economy; the &quot;Arab Cold War;&quot; civil strife and guerilla movements; the nature of political regimes in the region; religious activism; violence and delinquency, and the prospects for federalism and monetary union."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "DiscussionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Exam, mid-termPaper, final"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted to Norris website***<br/>Madawi Al-Rasheed.
