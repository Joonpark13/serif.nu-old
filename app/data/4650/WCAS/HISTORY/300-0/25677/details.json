No musical training is necessary to enroll in the course, however we will think about how to analyze musical sound as historical &quot;text.&quot; We will also focus on the cultural, social, political, and economic dimensions (the &quot;context&quot;) of genres ranging from Tin Pan Alley to blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, country, folk, soul, rock, disco, hip-hop, and classical. We will explore popular music as an art form, a business, an activity of identity-making, a phenomenon encompassing both conflict and consensus, and a key area in the life of Americans. Students are expected to attend lectures, discussion sections, and complete all reading, listening, and viewing assignments. Writing about popular music history is a key aspect of the class: there will be three essays that ask students to use, respectively, a song, a performer, and a genre to analyze how popular music has shaped the broader cultural history of the US."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion sectionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Other: (short assignments)<br/>Papers: (3 papers, 5-7 pgs.)<br/>Quizzes"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted to Norris website***"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "value": "Larry Starr and Christopher Waterman.
