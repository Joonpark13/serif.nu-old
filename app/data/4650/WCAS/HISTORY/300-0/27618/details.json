This history has been filled with intimacy, fascination, and<br/>integration, on the one hand, and estrangement, exploitation, and misunderstanding, on the other.<br/>Dancing bodies both reflected and shaped the complex relationship between the United States<br/>and Latin America. Weekly readings include primary documents, secondary sources, and<br/>audiovisual materials featuring famous professionals in grand theatres and in films, social<br/>dancers in clubs, ethnographers moving between and among dancing faithful, frolicking Disney<br/>cartoons, and Latin American dancers in Chicago.<br/><br/>We examine the dancing relationship between the United States and Latin America in three<br/>units. Part I considers the cross border lives of famous dancers that united the Americas as a<br/>singular, transnational stage. We ask how their performances destabilized asymmetries of power<br/>within the region. For Part II, we analyze emerging definitions of modernism that fuelled<br/>choreographic and ethnographic activities in the hemisphere. We interrogate how shared interests<br/>and imaginings of the &quot;modern&quot; simultaneously challenged and reinscribed hierarchies within<br/>and between societies. Finally, in Part III, we focus on Cuban concert dance, as a telling example<br/>of the bonds and divides that resulted from a fraught relationship with the U.S.?forged by<br/>neocolonialism, Cold War clashes, and most recently, reconciliation. We close the unit by<br/>sharing oral history projects about Latin American dancers in Chicago and seeing a Cuban<br/>modern dance company perform to understand the dynamics of dance dialogues between the<br/>U.S. and Latin America in the present."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Attendance: 5%<br/>Class participation: 10%<br/>Field trips: (attend MalPaso performance) 10%<br/>Project, final: 25%<br/>Research project: (archiving an event: Ana Pavlova in Mexico City) 15%<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted to Norris website**8<br/>Course Packet"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Americas"}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:59 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
