[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In 1945, Germany was in ruins. The defeat of the Nazis had physically destroyed Germany's infrastructure, morally delegitimized its institutions, and politically divided its territory between a capitalist West and a socialist East. The German-German border, most vividly symbolized by the Berlin Wall, became one of the defining sites of the Cold War. This course examines the formation of two separate German states and the solutions that they developed to the common challenge of turning Nazis back into citizens, rebuilding a devastated economy, remembering Nazi crimes, and navigating between the two American and Soviet superpowers. The course also explores how these two different societies responded to terrorism, environmental degradation, and immigration and asylum seekers. Finally, we will analyze the reunification of the two German states after 1989 and the challenges that continue to confront Germany today. How is it that this ruined land of 1945 could become, within fifty years, the wealthiest and most stable nation in Europe?", "name": "Weimar and Nazi Germany", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 121", "topic": "Post-WWII Germany", "course": "344-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/HISTORY/344-0/21994", "instructor": ["Lauren K Stokes"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "21994", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
