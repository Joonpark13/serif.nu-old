Less well known, however, are the remarkably rich - and remarkably diverse - literary cultures that the Mughal court promoted, and which saturated the cultural, political, and religious life of early modern India more generally. This course will introduce students to some of the basic features of these intersecting Indo-Persian, Sanskrit, and Hindi-Urdu literary worlds (in translation, of course), as well as to their lasting - and sometimes controversial - legacies in modern South Asian culture and politics, from British India to Bollywood."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Paper, final: (for 392 students = 12-15 pgs, &amp; for 395 students = 18-25 pgs.)<br/>Papers"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted to Norris website***<br/>Assorted Readings on Canvas"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Asia/Middle East; Global History"}], "lmod": "12/25/16 7:00 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
