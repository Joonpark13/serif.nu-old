The central part of the seminar focuses in more detail on Hamas, \"Islamic Jihad,\" and the Islamic Movement in Israel. It analyses the causes for the rise of revivalist Islam in the territories and in Israel since the 1970s. It deals with the ideology and political platform of Hamas as outlined in its \"Charter\" (the Islamicization of the Israel-Arab conflict, the Islamicization of the Palestinian nation identity). We will examine the doctrinal and practical principle of Jihad and the idea of martyrdom in Islam (Istishad).
