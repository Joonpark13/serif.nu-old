The global analysis starts in France; proceeds with the spread of revolutionary ideologies in the Americas; returns to Europe for 1848 and 1917; tacks back to the Americas for peasant revolutions in Mexico and Cuba; and then migrates to China and Iran, before ending by considering the revolutions that never happened. En route we will consider not just current scholarship, but also the intellectual history of revolution in the work of Tocqueville, Marx, Lenin, Guevara and Scott. Assessment will be on the basis of short critical essays, blog posts and a final term paper on a topic of your choice."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Papers"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted to Norris website***<br/>TBD"}], "lmod": "12/25/16 7:00 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
