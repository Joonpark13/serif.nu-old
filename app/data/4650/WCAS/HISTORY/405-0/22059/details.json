But as many have argued recently, scholars invested in &quot;thinking big&quot; about history sometimes have difficulty addressing people who did not move across political boundaries, and they have typically neglected small, ordinary stories and domestic spaces. Since these have been the traditional interests of women's historians, the fields of global and women's history often seem irreconcilable, especially in the era before the twentieth century. One possible solution to this impasse is to deploy the analytical category of gender, which should be able to speak to both fields and across long spans of time. How have historians done this? What does gender history look like on a global scale? In this seminar, we will consider these questions, reading recent work that combines global and gender history in the early modern and modern eras."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationPaper, finalPapers"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted to Norris website***<br/>Burton.
