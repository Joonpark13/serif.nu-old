It is not designed as TA training, but as an opportunity to engage with the most interesting questions that arise in teaching history and to acquire the skills necessary for teaching standalone courses, including designing syllabi and giving lectures. Compared to other graduate seminars, the footprint of this course will be light: meetings only every other week and short assignments. This course is recommended for students to take in their third years and is ideal preparation for teaching seminars and for the job market."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Other: (teaching portfolio)<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted to Norris website***"}], "lmod": "12/25/16 7:01 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
