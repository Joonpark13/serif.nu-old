[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "\"Asian America\" is a composite of ethnic communities formed by migration from the region of \"Asia.\" But what is the history of how these disparate groups came to become known as \"Asian America\"? In this course, we will explore the histories of various Asian American communities (e.g. Chinese American, Japanese American, Korean American, Filipina/o American, Indian American, Native Hawai'ian communities). Our readings will begin with the pre-World War II Asian American experiences of exclusion and community establishment. We will then consider how it is that these different communities became known as an Asian American \"community,\" especially through the experience of the Second World War. Finally, we will read stories of post-1960s migrations and the ideological and material divisions that have emerged in Asian America.", "name": "Asian American History", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "214-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/HISTORY/214-0/25731", "instructor": ["Justin K Tse"], "id": "25731", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
