In this course, we will explore the histories of various Asian American communities (e.g. Chinese American, Japanese American, Korean American, Filipina/o American, Indian American, Native Hawai'ian communities). Our readings will begin with the pre-World War II Asian American experiences of exclusion and community establishment. We will then consider how it is that these different communities became known as an Asian American &quot;community,&quot; especially through the experience of the Second World War. Finally, we will read stories of post-1960s migrations and the ideological and material divisions that have emerged in Asian America."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation: 20%<br/>Exam, final: 30%<br/>Exam, mid-term: 205<br/>Writing assignments: (Comparative Book Report) 30%<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until order posted to Norris website***<br/>Gary Okihiro, American History Unbound: Asians and Pacific Islanders. 9780520274358"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "AREA OF CONCENTRATION: Americas"}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:59 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
