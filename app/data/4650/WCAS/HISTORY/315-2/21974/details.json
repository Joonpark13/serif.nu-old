It opens in the depth of the depression, a crisis as profound as any the United States had faced since disunion; moves through two global wars - one hot, the other cold - and into a period of unprecedented prosperity; follows the upsurge of activism that put the question of equality at the center of public life; and ends with the massive upheavals of the late 1960s, when the political order we live with today began to take shape. In this course, in other words, students will find the roots of our time."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "DiscussionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationPapers: (three argumentative essays and occasional response papers based on readings, discussions, lectures)<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted to Norris website***<br/>Lizabeth Cohen, Making a New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago, 1919-1939. 9780521715355.<br/>Adam Cohen and Elizabeth Taylor, American Pharaoh: Mayor Richard J.
