[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "How did corn change African politics? What did indigenous silver miners in Mexico contribute to the fall of a great Chinese dynasty? Did an intense episode of &quot;global cooling&quot; make people all over the world more amenable to rebellion? Why did it become fashionable for women in so many places to wear striped cotton and drink hot tea out of porcelain cups? Why did Britain industrialize before Holland, China, or Japan? How many continents are there, and which one was home to Batavia? This course addresses these questions and many more as it traces the history of the world between 1500 and 1850. During this era, commonly known as the early modern period, trade, migration, ecological change, epidemics, intellectual ferment, and technological innovation connected far-flung areas of the globe. In this course, we will consider the dense web of connections that traversed the Eurasian landmass, reached across the Arctic Circle, and spanned the vast oceans connecting the Old World and the New. Using the paradigms of connection, comparison, and contact, we will &quot;think big,&quot; in part to consider the antecedents of our own globalized era and in part to ponder the disconnections and discontinuities between the early modern world and our own.", "name": "Global History: Early Modern to Modern Transition", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "250-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/HISTORY/250-1/25661", "instructor": ["Amy Beth Stanley"], "id": "25661", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
