[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course serves as an introduction for majors and non-majors to the history of pre-industrial Europe, roughly 1000-1750. We will survey the political, economic, social, cultural, and intellectual developments that transformed European civilization, and trace the varied ways in which historians have sought to make sense of them. Our focus will primarily be on Western Europe, though we will also explore the extent to which Europeans were fundamentally shaped by their encounters with non-European cultures. Specific topics include the Crusades, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment.", "name": "European Civilization: High Medieval Thru Mid-18th C", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "201-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 1:00PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/HISTORY/201-1/21952", "instructor": ["David   Shyovitz"], "id": "21952", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
