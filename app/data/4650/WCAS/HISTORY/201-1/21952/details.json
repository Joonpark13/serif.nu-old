We will survey the political, economic, social, cultural, and intellectual developments that transformed European civilization, and trace the varied ways in which historians have sought to make sense of them. Our focus will primarily be on Western Europe, though we will also explore the extent to which Europeans were fundamentally shaped by their encounters with non-European cultures. Specific topics include the Crusades, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, and the Enlightenment."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion sectionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Exam, finalExam, mid-termPapers"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted to Norris website***<br/>TBA"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "AREA OF CONCENTRATION: European"}], "lmod": "12/25/16 7:00 PM (CT)", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
