[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course explores the social spaces of science and medicine in early modern Europe during the so-called 'Scientific Revolution.' We will survey the varied and surprising spaces in which scientific and medical knowledge was produced, from princely courts and grand cathedrals to humble artisanal workshops and Europe's overseas colonies. In so doing, we will see how science and medicine intersected with religion, politics, and emerging market economies during the first age of European imperialism and globalization.", "name": "History of Western Science and Medicine: Origins in Early Mod Europe", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 121", "topic": "", "course": "275-1", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/HISTORY/275-1/21962", "instructor": ["Lydia   Barnett"], "class_attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "21962", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
