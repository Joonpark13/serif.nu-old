[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course surveys the history and historiography of the Jews of medieval Europe, with a particular emphasis on Jewish-Christian relations. We will trace the cultural, intellectual, and socioeconomic shifts that transformed Jewish life over the course of the Middle Ages, and the important roles played by Jews (real and imagined) in medieval Christian culture. Primary readings will include chronicles, literary works, legal texts, polemical tracts, and theological treatises; we will also survey both classic and current secondary works, and explore the diverse theoretical approaches that have been used to deepen scholars' understanding of this period.", "name": "Topics in History", "section": "20", "topic": "Jewish Life in Medieval Europe", "course": "492-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/HISTORY/492-0/22109", "instructor": ["David   Shyovitz"], "id": "22109", "subject": "HISTORY"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "After a generation of relative neglect, political history has enjoyed a renaissance in recent decades, profitably combining elements of the social and cultural history that once pushed it aside with its more customary concerns with state power and policy to forge a new political history. Such work looks beyond the formal political process and traditional political class to expand our notion of what politics is and how and where it happens. This course will introduce graduate students to some of the best new political history of the United States to chart the field's evolution, insights, and parameters, and seek its future directions.
