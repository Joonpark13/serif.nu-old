It will address important topics in recorded Chinese history: the Neolithic and Bronze Age foundations of Chinese civilization; the question of how the geographical space we call China became &quot;Chinese;&quot; the evolution of classical Chinese philosophy; the splendor and social tensions of the commercialized urban centers; the increasing constriction of women's lives after the twelfth century; the Mongol conquest of Eurasia; the shift in Eurasian trade from caravan to maritime travel; and some of the continuities and transformations that mark early modern China. Particular attention will be paid to the Tang-Song Transition (or the medieval Chinese revolution) from the eighth to the thirteenth centuries, a period of fundamental commercial, religious, philosophical, and social transformation.", "name": "Chinese Civilization", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "281-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/HISTORY/281-0/21966", "instructor": ["Melissa A Macauley"], "id": "21966", "subject": "HISTORY"}]
