It will address important topics in recorded Chinese history: the Neolithic and Bronze Age foundations of Chinese civilization; the question of how the geographical space we call China became &quot;Chinese;&quot; the evolution of classical Chinese philosophy; the splendor and social tensions of the commercialized urban centers; the increasing constriction of women's lives after the twelfth century; the Mongol conquest of Eurasia; the shift in Eurasian trade from caravan to maritime travel; and some of the continuities and transformations that mark early modern China. Particular attention will be paid to the Tang-Song Transition (or the medieval Chinese revolution) from the eighth to the thirteenth centuries, a period of fundamental commercial, religious, philosophical, and social transformation."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "DiscussionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Discussion sectionExam, finalExam, mid-termPapers"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted on Norris website***<br/>Patricia Buckley Ebrey, The Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 2nd ed. 9780521124331.<br/>William T. de Bary, ed., Sources of Chinese Tradition, 2nd ed., vol. 1. 9780231109390.<br/>Wu Ch'eng-en, Monkey: Folk Novel of China. 9780802130860.<br/>Marco Polo, The Travels. 9780140440577.<br/>Edward Dreyer.
