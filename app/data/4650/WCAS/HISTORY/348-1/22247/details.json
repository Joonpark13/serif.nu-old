Why Americans consider them too traditional and conservative while Russians and Poles view them as too leftist and liberal? Using the tension between history and memory as a thinking tool, this course explores how East European Jews perceived historical upheavals such as wars, revolutions and pogroms, how they built a robust civilization in and of itself active over 700 years, how they interacted with Christians, and how imperial politics in the Russian Empire and Austria-Hungary shaped Jewish identities that guide Jewish mentality to date. This course traces the itinerary of East European Jews from the times of the medieval Kievan Rus to the early twentieth-century revolutionary upheavals taking a close look at Jews in Poland and the Russian Empire, which also include Lithuania and Ukraine. It challenges cultural myths, provides substantial European context and integrates Jewish history within a framework of a broader imperial and national histories."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion sectionLecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation: 30%<br/>Paper, final: (research paper, 11 pgs.) 40%<br/>Papers: (two 2 pgs. response papers) 30%<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted to Norris website***<br/>Antony Polonsky.
