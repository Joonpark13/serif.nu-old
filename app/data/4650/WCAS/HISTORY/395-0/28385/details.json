We shall examine the major issues of the British occupation, the Palace faction and the centrist Wafd Party-in the context of their spiraling confrontation. We shall analyze the background of Gamal Abd al-Nasir (Nasser) and his associates (including Anwar al-Sadat) in order to pose a fundamental question: were these individuals committed to genuine social change or did they remain bourgeois capitalists, psychologically tied to the West, and thus dependent on it? Subsequently, we shall examine Egypt's involvement with the Palestine Problem, dilemmas of economic growth, international alignments, and the 'Cold Peace' with Israel."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation: 50%<br/>Paper, final: Paper, final: (for 392 students = length TBD &amp; for 395 students = 15-25 pgs.) 50%<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted to Norris website*** <br/>William Cleveland.
