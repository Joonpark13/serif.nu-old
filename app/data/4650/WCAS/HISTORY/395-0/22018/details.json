Acoustic guitars, camp fires, overly sincere singers, and &quot;Kumbaya&quot; politics are the clich\u00e9s many call to mind. To study it through digital means, however, reveals important connections between the history of the revival and issues of technology, culture, and politics in the modern world. <br/><br/>In this research seminar, we examine the history of the US folk music revival through readings, audio listening, documentary films, seminar discussions, and, most of all, extensive digital analysis to investigate these connections. Working in platforms such as Omeka and WordPress, with tools ranging from Audacity sound editing software to mapping, annotation, and timeline programs, we use the archives of the Berkeley Folk Music Festival (in Northwestern's Special Collections and online) and other primary sources to probe what was at stake in the folk revival in relation to: American culture and politics; questions of race, class, gender, age, and region; and the strange workings of music-making, memory, and power. <br/><br/>As we do so, we ask how digital technologies might help us to interpret history more meaningfully; simultaneously, we explore how the folk revival itself might be useful for understanding digital approaches to history and the humanities today. In other words, how does the new inform the old, but also how can the old help us confront the new.<br/><br/>Each student will be evaluated based on class participation, weekly digital mini-project experiments, presentations, and a final multimedia interpretive digital history project that is the multimedia equivalent of a 15-20 page analytic essay based on original research. <br/><br/>No previous digital or musical training is required for the course. For students with advanced digital media/programming skills or musical training, the course presents an opportunity to connect that background to deep historical study; for students interested in acquiring digital or musical skills, the seminar offers an excellent introductory pathway to these areas of knowledge."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Other: (digital work)<br/>Seminar"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participationPaper, final: (interpretive digital history podcast project)<br/>Papers: (weekly digital history assignments)<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "***Tentative until posted to Norris website***<br/>Elijah Wald.
