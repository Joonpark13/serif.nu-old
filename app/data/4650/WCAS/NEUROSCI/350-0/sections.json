[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "In this laboratory course you will perform electrophysiological experiments in which signals from living neurons (action potentials, local field potentials, post synaptic potentials) are recorded using amplifiers and data logging equipment commonly found in advanced research labs around the world. You will learn to analyze and interpret the signals that you record and learn to use chemical compounds to alter neural activity. Once a basic understanding of neural recording is achieved, you will reproduce classic neuroscience experiments, such as inducing long term potentiation in hippocampal neurons. The experience of this class will help you appreciate the complexity of the brain and will help neuroscience textbook material that you have covered in other classes come to life.
