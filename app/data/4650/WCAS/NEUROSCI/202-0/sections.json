[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course introduces students to the cellular and molecular processes that allow neurons to operate properly, and how these processes lead to basic sensory and motor functions, the storage of information, and the manifestation of neurological disease. Each lecture tackles a fundamental question best answered by studying the nervous system at the cellular and molecular level, including but not limited to: What constitutes the ?nervous system'? What gives neurons the potential to generate electrical activity? What determines whether a neuron is ?active' or not? How do neurons relay signals? Can communication between neurons be modified? How is the external world transformed into neural activity? How is neural activity transformed into actions? How do neurons make appropriate connections with one another? How is information retained by the nervous system? What happens when neurons fail to communicate normally? The content is designed to provide a strong foundation for students to pursue any specialty within neuroscience.", "name": "Cellular & Molecular Neuroscience", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute AUD", "topic": "", "course": "202-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/NEUROSCI/202-0/21785", "instructor": ["David   McLean"], "class_attributes": "Natural Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "21785", "subject": "NEUROSCI"}]
