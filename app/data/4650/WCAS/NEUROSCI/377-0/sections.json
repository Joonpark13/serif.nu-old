[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Every day we experience our environment by sensing a combination of light (vision), pressure wave (hearing), chemical (taste, smell), and tactile (touch and pain) signals. Our nervous system is able to integrate and react to an ever-changing environment because of the existence of very specialized sensory cells throughout the body that detect external stimuli. Signals are then relayed to the brain where they allow us to perceive, interpret, and respond to sights, sounds, tastes, smells, touch, and pain. This course will provide an in-depth look at five major sensory systems: visual, auditory, gustatory, olfactory, and somatosensory, including their peripheral receptors and the central pathways leading to perception of the cues mentioned above.", "name": "Neurobiology of Sensation and Perception", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "377-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 2:00PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/NEUROSCI/377-0/21784", "instructor": ["Tiffany Marie Schmidt"], "id": "21784", "subject": "NEUROSCI"}]
