[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "There is such beauty and power in storytelling. The best of nonfiction narrative pokes and prods our preconceptions, pushing us to imagine the world through the eyes of others. What makes for a compelling story? How can we make nonfiction read like literature? How do we tell true stories that are both intimate and vivid? We'll explore the craft of reporting and research which borrows from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, history and sociology - and work with rigor and discipline on the art of good writing. We'll read nonfiction narratives - both book and magazine articles (and listen to some radio) - on a host of subjects, ranging from war and poverty to the environment and sports. We'll work in this class as a professional writer might, from draft to draft. There will be regular writing assignments, and students will be asked to craft a longer narrative on a subject of their choosing. The course will be run as a seminar so there will be an emphasis on critical class discussion - and workshopping your writing.", "name": "The Art of Nonfiction", "section": "20", "topic": "Telling Stories", "course": "303-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/WRITING/303-0/27455", "instructor": ["Alex W Kotlowitz"], "id": "27455", "subject": "WRITING"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "", "name": "The Art of Nonfiction", "section": "21", "topic": "Writing for Social Change", "course": "303-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/WRITING/303-0/27456", "instructor": ["Robert A Gundlach"], "id": "27456", "subject": "WRITING"}]
