How can we make nonfiction read like literature? How do we tell true stories that are both intimate and vivid? We'll explore the craft of reporting and research which borrows from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, history and sociology - and work with rigor and discipline on the art of good writing. We'll read nonfiction narratives - both book and magazine articles (and listen to some radio) - on a host of subjects, ranging from war and poverty to the environment and sports.
