[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "<p>Three times a day we make a choice with an impact that reaches around the world, under the ground, and into the atmosphere - a choice about what we eat. Can we eat \"ethically\" and, if so, what does that look like? This class will delve into the history, politics, and science of food, consider various perspectives, investigate alternate food systems, and explore our role as consumers. We will examine a range of topics including food economies, GMOs, \"greenwashing,\" labor relations and workers' rights, food security, animal rights, and the future of food production.</p><br/><p>The environmental and societal implications of food are complex, wide-ranging, and can make consumer choices difficult to navigate. This course will help students to think critically about choosing what to eat and how it connects them to a broad range of issues.</p>", "name": "Student Organized Seminar-P/N Required", "section": "20", "location": "Annenberg Hall G29", "topic": "Navigating Modern Food Ethics", "course": "298-0", "meeting_time": ["We 6:00PM - 8:30PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/GEN_LA/298-0/27502", "instructor": ["Nyree J C Zerega"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27502", "subject": "GEN_LA"}]
