[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will give students grounding in contemporary topics in translation studies by focusing on some of the problems embedded in its history and practice: translation's employment in the contexts of war, displacement, and empire; its role in national canon formation and transnational literary circulation amid the hegemonic force of Anglicization; and the importance of translation problems?mistranslation, &quot;bad translation,&quot; and untranslatability?to current discussions of translation's politics and ethics. Alongside a theoretical corpus that includes authors like Friedrich Schleirmacher, Walter Benjamin, Jacques Derrida, Gayatri Spivak, Emily Apter, and Abdelfattah Kilito, we will look at several examples of &quot;translation problems&quot;: problematic case studies of literary transmission from MENA languages to English. Students are encouraged to bring their own language competencies to bear on seminar discussions, but fluency in a second language is not required. Students will give oral presentations, write one short essay, and contribute to a final symposium on the topic of literary transmissions to English.", "name": "Approaches and Perspectives in MENA Studies", "section": "20", "topic": "Translation Theory", "course": "411-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/MENA/411-0/22722", "instructor": ["Rebecca Carol Johnson"], "id": "22722", "subject": "MENA"}]
