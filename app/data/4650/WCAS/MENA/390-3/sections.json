We will begin the course by critically revisiting the historical legacies that mediate contemporary debates on and representations of Muslims and Islam. We will explore what it means to take Islam as an object of anthropological analysis and the kinds of normative assumptions that underlie references to \"religion\" and \"tradition.\" Second, we will closely examine seminal interventions advanced by Ernst Gellner, Clifford Geertz and Michael Gilsenan before turning to Talal Asad's analysis of anthropological categories of religion and his attempts to reformulate the study of Islam as a discursive tradition. Situating these debates within the broader intellectual history of anthropological thought, we will then proceed to examine the analytical purchase of symbolic, discursive and practice-centered approaches in studies of Islam. In the second half of the course, we will shift our attention to more ethnographically grounded materials that explore Muslim engagements with, and responses to, various facets of modernity such as gender inequality, capitalist economics and neoliberalist development, religious minorities and the secular nation-state as well urban life and practices of leisure.", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "Advanced Topics in Middle East & North African Studies", "title": "WCAS MENA 390-3-21 Advanced Topics in Middle East &amp; North African Studies", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:46 PM (CT)", "section": "21", "topic": "Anthropology of Islam: Symbol, Discourse, Practice", "course": "390-3", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This seminar is designed to analyze anthropological approaches to the study of Islam and Muslims in the MENA region and the Islamicate world.
