Large protest movements have challenged different regimes throughout the country's contemporary history, including the 1905 Constitutional Revolution, 1963 Uprising, 1979 Islamic Revolution, and 2009 Green Movement. Why have so many mass uprisings and revolutions occurred in Iran? Has Iran been a revolutionary country? Why did the 1979 Revolution succeed, but the 2009 Green Movement fail? These are some of the questions that will be studied in this course. The aim of this course is to compare the Iranian revolutions in 1979 and 2009 by studying the processes, causes, and outcomes of these revolutions. This course will be divided into three sections. It will begin by briefly examining the recent theories of revolution and revolutionary movement. The second part of the course will focus on the Iranian Revolution that overthrew the monarchy regime in 1979. We will also study the causes of the Iranian revolution using most influential theoretical approaches, such as structural, cultural, discourse, mobilization, feminist, and Marxist. The third part of this course will be focused on the Green Movement, or Green Revolution, that followed the disputed 2009 presidential election. The course will cover the nature of the Green Movement, as well as the causes for its failure, and its impact on &quot;Arabs' awaking.&quot; The course will culminate with a general theory of revolution and revolutionary movements in Iran."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "lecture and discussion"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation: 30%<br/>MidtermExam: 35%<br/>Final Paper: 35%"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Texts:<br/>?
