[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course will examine the connection between popular culture and politics in the Middle East and North Africa. Popular culture - including films, music, poetry, street art, the internet, and television - has been a critical means for expressing political viewpoints and indeed motivating political action. It has also been used by groups and governments seeking to maintain power and repress populist sentiment. This course will take a careful and critical view of different examples of popular culture from across the region, asking what kind of politics they embody and enable. We will concentrate on what popular culture tells us about social change and hierarchies of power related to nation-states, generations, social class, gender, race/ethnicity, and religion.", "name": "Seminar in Middle East and North African Studies", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge 4531 MENA Seminar Rm", "topic": "Protest and Popular Culture in the Middle East", "course": "301-2", "meeting_time": ["Fr 1:00PM - 3:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/MENA/301-2/22714", "instructor": ["Jessica R Winegar"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "22714", "subject": "MENA"}]
