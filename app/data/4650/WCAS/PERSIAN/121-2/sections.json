[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This class will build on the first quarter of the sequence, strengthening students' abilities to communicate complex ideas in Persian and engage with authentic Persian language materials. The second quarter will be thematically focused on Ferdowsi's Shah-nama; we will read sections of the poem in verse and prose abridgments, watch films and cartoons based on the poem, and read secondary scholarship in Persian. After completing the course, students will be able to scan poetry for meter, summarize major episodes from the Shah-nama, and interpret the poem's moral, literary, and social significance in papers and formal presentations.", "name": "Persian II", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "121-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/PERSIAN/121-2/22699", "instructor": ["Austin Michael O'Malley"], "id": "22699", "subject": "PERSIAN"}]
