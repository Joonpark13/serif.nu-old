[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This introductory Persian course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students, and to students with some background in Persian as well as to those entirely new to the language. The course is the second of the year-long sequence that runs for 3 consecutive quarters, Fall to Spring. The basics of Persian grammar are presented, and these are reinforced by in-class dialogs and readings. By the end of the first year, students should be able to read and write Persian script with ease and make themselves understood in most practical situations.", "name": "Persian I", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "111-2", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/PERSIAN/111-2/22696", "instructor": ["Austin Michael O'Malley"], "id": "22696", "subject": "PERSIAN"}]
