For students interested in politics in the Chicago area or similar large cities, understanding the political traditions, contemporary debates, and avenues for fruitful action are key elements of thoughtful political analysis. Taught from an historical-institutional perspective, this course focuses on the key institutions of local governance, and how entrepreneurial actors can navigate and/or change those institutions to achieve their policy goals. Using this lens, it identifies both opportunities for meaningful political action and challenges for successful local governance in large cities. The course capstone is a case study of a particular contemporary political actor and an analysis of that actor's strategy for pursuing a specific goal, with attention to both the hurdles and opportunities that present themselves to local political actors. Over the term, students learn current models of local politics; encounter illustrations of how actors can design institutions that structure outcomes, and how layered institutions intersect with each other; and learn how these ideas have been important in shaping the course of Chicago's political and social realities.", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "Ideas and Institutions in Urban Politics", "title": "WCAS POLI_SCI 322-0-20 Ideas and Institutions in Urban Politics", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:47 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Thomas Kenneth Ogorzalek", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "322-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "Most politics in the US is local, but few Americans know much about or participate in local politics.
