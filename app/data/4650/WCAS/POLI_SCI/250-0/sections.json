[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course debates the causes of global divergences in political, social and economic outcomes: why do levels of socio-economic development vary so greatly cross-nationally? Why are some countries governed by representative democratic institutions, whereas others are governed by repressive authoritarian regimes? Why do some countries entertain years of peace and stability whereas others are plagued by civil conflict and violence? The course provides an introduction to the field of comparative politics (whereas the subfield of international relations focuses on the relations between countries, comparative politics examines the political institutions and processes within countries). We will analyze the causes of this cross-national variation by contrasting competing arguments. Students will gain the ability to understand the complexity of contemporary political systems, and the underlying causal factors that help us to explain the divergences between countries across the world. <br/><br/>The first part of the course introduces some conceptual tools in comparative politics; these will provide the conceptual framework that we will employ throughout the course as we examine the political and economic development of a range of countries. Each student will ?represent' a particular country throughout the course, which will culminate in a simulated debate.", "name": "Introduction to Comparative Politics", "section": "20", "location": "University Hall 102", "topic": "", "course": "250-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/POLI_SCI/250-0/22860", "instructor": ["Rachel Beatty Riedl"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "22860", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
