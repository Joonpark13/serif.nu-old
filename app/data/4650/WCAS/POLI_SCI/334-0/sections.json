[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The Latino population consists of approximately 53 million people in the United States. The rapid growth of the Latino population has brought about a new pattern of population diversity in the United States. In 2000, for the first time in our nations' history, Latinos had surpassed African Americans as the largest minority group in America. This demographic change has brought about profound economic, educational, and political implications for the U.S. polity. And, the fact that Latinos make up a majority of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. only complicates these matters.<br/><br/>This course will explore these implications and the histories including the more contemporary social and political developments of Latino communities in the United States from a comparative urban framework. We will focus on the experiences of select Latino groups residing in the U.S. including Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans.<br/><br/>The first part of the course will examine the social construction of Latino identities and trace the historical experiences of select groups, comparing the elements behind each group's migration and how those processes affect their incorporation in mainstream society. We also examine demographic resources and the impact of immigration on the politics of the Latino collectivity. Next, we turn to the development of a Latino politics, placing special emphasis on political attitudes, mobilization strategies and electoral participation. Lastly, we tackle public policy issues such as voting rights, immigration reform, and immigrant integration practices. <br/><br/>The question that we will return to throughout the course is the degree to which and under what circumstances is it appropriate to speak of a Latino community.", "name": "Latino Politics", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-415", "topic": "", "course": "334-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/POLI_SCI/334-0/23055", "instructor": ["Jaime   Dominguez"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "23055", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
