The course focuses on both the historical experience of Europe and the contemporary experience of countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In the historical discussion, we explore the birth of the &quot;nation state&quot; as the basic organizing unit of the international system; the transition from agrarian to industrial economic systems; and the expansion of European colonialism across the globe. In our discussion of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, we consider the legacies of colonialism for development; the ways in which countries have attempted to promote economic development and industrialization; and issues of inequality and human welfare in an increasingly globally connected world."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Yuval Noah Harrari, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (New York: Harper Collins, 2015).<br/><br/>Robert H.
