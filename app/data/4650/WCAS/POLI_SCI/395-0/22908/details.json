Why do they join one of the warring sides, including rebels, paramilitaries or regular armies? Why do they resist against the presence of these groups in their territory? Why do they support rebels or incumbents? Why do they leave their hometowns to become refugees or internally displaced? How do they change their decisions regarding economic activities, social relations, and family dynamics? We approach these questions through both theoretical and empirical pieces (including case studies, comparative analyses, and human rights reports)."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Must be a junior or senior"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "(i) Students will acquire a critical understanding of the situation of civilians in contexts of war as well as their choices.<br/>(ii) Students will acquire a critical understanding of the dynamics of civil war.<br/>(iii) Students will improve their analytical skills for studying political and social phenomena.
