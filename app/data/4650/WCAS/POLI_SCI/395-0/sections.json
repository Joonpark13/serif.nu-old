How do we know what we know about human rights abuses? In this course students will consider the relationship between the documentation of human rights abuses and justice. In our examination we will question: on what does the will to address human rights depend? And, how do the international narratives that emerge of human rights abuses relate to the victims and survivors of those abuses? Students will be introduced to the international human rights framework and then focus on the practice of human rights through case studies on the prosecution of sexual violence in international courts, the advocacy campaign to end the warehousing of refugees in camps and the struggle to recognize FGM as a form of persecution. We will question the received wisdom about the role of human rights in struggles for justice and learn about tensions between human rights and national sovereignty, the role of advocacy groups and the challenges of localizing human rights. Students will be introduced to the methodologies and tools of human rights documentation and consider the challenges of thinking as a human rights advocate. Based on our study of research and writing about rights, students will develop and share their own research projects.", "name": "Political Research Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "University Library 4670", "topic": "Critical Perspectives on Human Rights", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/POLI_SCI/395-0/22905", "instructor": ["Galya Benarieh Ruffer"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>Auditing not permitted<br/><br/>Department Majors Only<br/><br/>Juniors/Seniors Only<br/><br/>", "id": "22905", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The Unequal Global Political Economy, Prof. Moses Khisa, Winter 2017<br/>The globe is diverse, varied, and complex. But it is also highly unequal and uneven. Scholarly debates have focused mainly on global economic inequality. But there is gross political inequality too, in the regimes and institutions that govern transnational relations, in military capabilities, and in the political influences that nation-states and non-state actors wield. There are extreme inequalities in the global distribution of material resources and wealth, but there is equally wide disparities in the concentration of particularly influential ideas and political practices between the global North and the South.<br/>In this research and writing seminar, we will take up this topical and critical aspect of the global political economy and interrogate its wide-ranging causes and consequences. The first part of this seminar will survey key domains of material and political inequality, including disparities in national and cross-national income, production output, supranational organizations and global governance institutions, trade and financial flows, multilateral agreements, among others. The second part of the seminar will cover some of the major consequences of global political and economic inequality: poverty and human development, borrowing and indebtedness, global order and instability, etc.", "name": "Political Research Seminar", "section": "22", "location": "University Library 4670", "topic": "The Unequal Global Political Economy", "course": "395-0", "meeting_time": ["We 3:30PM - 6:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/POLI_SCI/395-0/22906", "instructor": ["Moses   Khisa"], "class_attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory<br/><br/>Auditing not permitted<br/><br/>Department Majors Only<br/><br/>Juniors/Seniors Only<br/><br/>", "id": "22906", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}, {"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, Prof. Wendy Pearlman Winter 2017<br/>This course explores the history and politics of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.
