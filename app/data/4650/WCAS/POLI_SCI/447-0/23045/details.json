Critical theory seeks to expose those defects, bring them to public scrutiny, and introduce awareness of them into public debate.<br/><br/>This year we apply this perspective to Political Realism. The suspicion here is that Political Realism is an expression of nihilism. We explore that suspicion by reading two early sources of Realist thought, Carr's Twenty Year Crisis and Morgenthau's Scientific Man versus Power Politics. We then place that literature in debate with &quot;continental&quot; reactions to the same crisis, the crisis of the new &quot;thirty years war&quot; that brought Europe to its knees in the last century: Heidegger, Levinas, Patocka, and Camus. We end with speculations regarding the impact of the Cold War and its promotion of the more &quot;managerial&quot; thought that is Realism, and the continental tradition that focuses on &quot;meaning.&quot;<br/><br/>No prior exposure to Critical Theory is necessary."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Writing Assignment.
