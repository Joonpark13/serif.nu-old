The first half of the course focuses on the historical and institutional context of politics and government.

We compare explanations for the endurance of authoritarian regimes, examine the role of Islam in politics, and also look at the Iranian Revolution and Islamic Republic. The second half of the course concentrates on dynamics of mobilization and conflict. Here we explore the Arab uprisings that began in late 2010 and their aftermath, current challenges facing the search for stability and democracy in the region, the Syrian war, and the origins and evolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "Politics of the Middle East", "title": "WCAS POLI_SCI 351-0-20 Politics of the Middle East", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:47 PM (CT)", "section": "20", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "8474912259", "instructor_name": "Wendy R Pearlman", "instructor_addr": "Scott Hall #204"}], "associated_classes": [{"component": "DIS", "room": "Fisk Hall 114", "meeting_time": "Th 4:00PM - 4:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "Parkes Hall 212", "meeting_time": "Th 4:00PM - 4:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-430", "meeting_time": "Th 5:00PM - 5:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-339", "meeting_time": "Th 5:00PM - 5:50PM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "Fisk Hall 114", "meeting_time": "Fr 9:00AM - 9:50AM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "Fisk Hall 114", "meeting_time": "Fr 10:00AM - 10:50AM"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "TBA"}, {"component": "DIS", "room": "TBA", "meeting_time": "TBA"}], "topic": "", "course": "351-0", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course explores the comparative politics of the Middle East and North Africa.
