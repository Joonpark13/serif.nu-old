We will use a linear models framework to discuss significance tests, graphical displays, tests of assumptions, interpretation of coefficients and interactions, and questions of causal inference. We will also work through statistical computing skills such that students can use all of the above in their own work."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "&quot;Real Stats&quot; (2016) by Michael Bailey, Oxford University Press"}], "lmod": "12/29/16 7:04 PM (CT)", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
