[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This survey of major topics in comparative politics is designed for Ph.D. students to gain a broad overview of the contemporary state of the subfield, its evolution, and emerging research questions and controversies. Each week we will focus on a major thematic area, generally through the lens of a theoretical controversy. We will deconstruct the readings to identify the central issues at stake, the principal arguments of the works, the theoretical and empirical strengths and weaknesses, the methodological approach and means of marshaling evidence in support of the argument, the relation to scholarly disputes, and remaining work on this topic. The course will consider works of theoretical importance in all regions, both in the developed and developing world.", "name": "Comparative Politics Proseminar II", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "460-0", "meeting_time": ["Mo 9:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/POLI_SCI/460-0/23048", "instructor": ["Rachel Beatty Riedl"], "id": "23048", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
