[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course takes stock of African-American politics in the aftermath of the civil rights movement. We will explore the complex internal dynamics of black political life, paying attention to the \"who-gets-what-when-where-how\" dimension of politics. As we chart the shifts in the<br/>political fortunes and policy interests of blacks, we will focus on class, gender, generational, and other cleavages within the population. One of our chief aims will be to consider how different segments of the<br/>population have been affected by these shifts and changing fortunes. We also will examine blacks' relations with whites and their engagement with mainstream political institutions. In doing so, we will take up several topics that have occupied students of race and American politics since the civil rights movement: party politics, black-white voting patterns, group conflict and prejudice, the tension between integration and segregation, criminal justice policy, welfare policy, and political representation, including the election of the country's first black president.", "name": "African American Politics", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "327-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/POLI_SCI/327-0/22873", "instructor": ["Reuel R Rogers"], "id": "22873", "subject": "POLI_SCI"}]
