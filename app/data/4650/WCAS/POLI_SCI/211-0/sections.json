They are not like atoms and molecules in a chemical formula. They are more unstable, more ambiguous, and are subject to evolution over time. Their meaning, power, and relevance depend on how they are used and understood. Knowing how they are used and understood, in turn, requires interpretation. This course introduces students to methodological issues raised by interpretation. It is not limited to interpretive work alone, but addresses problems of interpretation as they crop up generally in political science scholarship. The goals of such scholarship vary from predicting to explaining to understanding to destabilizing and contesting dominant discourses. But in all cases there is interpretation. The gathering of events or people into \"kinds\" of events or \"kinds\" of people so as to manipulate them as variables in small-n or large-n analyses, for example, is an interpretive undertaking. For this reason this course seeks not only to introduce the student to interpretive methods narrowly conceived, but to place such methods against the backdrop of broader questions regarding what knowledge is, how we acquire it, and how interpretation contributes to that effort. In so doing, this course seeks to give students a firm methodological foundation that will enable them to read Political Science literature critically, and to conceptualize their subsequent research projects credibly.<br/><br/>The course is divided into three parts. In week 1 and again in week 9, we ask how research generates knowledge, what the specificity of interpretive knowledge is, and how it differs from knowledge generated by \"positivist\" methods. In weeks 2 through 4 we examine interpretation as understood by historians and anthropologists, that is, as an effort to reproduce and translate thought, values, and the world as engendered in and through cultures separated from ours by time and distance. We learn to select and evaluate our sources critically, whether written or oral, and we discuss how interpretation thus understood might be applied to the study of politics, that is, how to treat diplomacy or congressional politics, for example, as sites of specifiable but more or less foreign cultures. <br/><br/>Finally, from week 5 through week 8 we address issues and challenges that the ideal of interpreting and understanding must contend with. In week 5 we encounter the concept of reflexivity. Reflexivity means that the interpreter herself represents a historically and geographically specific culture. Interpreting thus means making sense across boundaries that divide cultures. Interpretive knowledge is not knowledge in an absolute sense, but rather knowledge that is meaningful within the culture of the interpreter. Awareness of one's own cultural situatedness allows the interpreter to use interpretation for purposes of developing an outsider's perspective on her home culture. <br/><br/>In week 6 we examine the issue of cultural hegemony and false consciousness, that is, the contention that culture is not conserving and relating a historically situated construction of the world, but rather an ideologically constructed view of the world, its truths and its values, that is in fact distorting or obfuscating reality for purposes of rule and domination. Interpretation in this context seeks to contribute to the ideal of social and political emancipation. In week 7 we examine genealogy, that is, the claim that interpretation as commonly practiced in the academy is arbitrarily selecting its archives so as to construct a rationalized reading of history. In week 8 we discuss deconstruction, which reminds us that concepts assume meaning in context, but that the context itself is elastic and unstable, and so endows concepts with meanings that are structurally ambiguous and insecure. Deconstruction thus understood becomes a tool with which to interrogate common sense, hegemonic values, and ideologies. <br/><br/>In sum, this course seeks to provide students with a firm understanding of the nature, the variety, and the challenges of interpretation, and its relevance to the study of politics. <br/><br/>An in-class mid-term will be scheduled which will count for \u00bc of the student's final grade. The final exam, scheduled by the Registrar, will count for \u00bd of the final grade. The remaining \u00bc is supplied by a 5-page essay on a question of interest to the student, to be approved by the instructor, on readings and issues addressed in this course.
