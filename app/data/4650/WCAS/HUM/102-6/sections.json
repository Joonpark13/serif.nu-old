These movements went by many names in many places, but they were united as part of a transnational \"Avant-Garde.\" Expressive artists such as Loie Fuller, Blaise Cendrars, William Carlos Williams and Diego Rivera all asked: how could the dancer's body, the painter's brush, or the poet's language represent the dizzying new sensations and technologies of modern life in an increasingly interconnected world? This course introduces students to the history of avant-garde movements across Europe and the Americas.

We'll conclude by examining how writers, film-makers and artists from World War II to the 1960s renewed avant-garde practices, often in the service of radical social movements, even as powerful institutions (such as the CIA) tried to coopt their objectives.
