[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "From 1900 to 1968, a series of artistic movements in performance, visual art, and literature shook readers and audiences around the world. These movements went by many names in many places, but they were united as part of a transnational &quot;Avant-Garde.&quot; Expressive artists such as Loie Fuller, Blaise Cendrars, William Carlos Williams and Diego Rivera all asked: how could the dancer's body, the painter's brush, or the poet's language represent the dizzying new sensations and technologies of modern life in an increasingly interconnected world? This course introduces students to the history of avant-garde movements across Europe and the Americas. We'll begin with the exhibitions and experiments in Europe before World War I, and follow the avant-garde's migrations from Paris and New York to Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo, and Mexico City, where avant-garde artists sought to participate in the revolutionary movements of the 1930s. We'll conclude by examining how writers, film-makers and artists from World War II to the 1960s renewed avant-garde practices, often in the service of radical social movements, even as powerful institutions (such as the CIA) tried to coopt their objectives. Our outlook will be restlessly &quot;transnational&quot; and &quot;interdisciplinary,&quot; and in order to learn about the vibrant legacies and continuations of the avant-garde, we will take field trips to several exciting Chicago-area performances, museums and archives.<br/><br/>Readings and other audiovisual materials may include poetry and manifestoes by F.T. Marinetti, Blaise Cendrars, Guillaume Apollinaire, Vicente Huidobro, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, Mina Loy, Jorge Luis Borges, Oliverio Girondo, and LeRoi Jones; the modern dance of Stravinsky, Diaghilev, Nijinsky, Louie Fuller, Sada Yacco, and Merce Cunningham; the paintings, photography and exhibitions of movements such as Cubism, Dadaism, Muralism, and Bauhaus; and essays by Octavio Paz, Walter Benjamin, Raymond Williams, and Marjorie Perloff.", "name": "Humanities in the World II", "section": "21", "topic": "The Avant-Garde in the World", "course": "211-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWe 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/HUM/211-0/24200", "instructor": ["Susan A Manning", "Maria Alejandra Uslenghi", "Harris Matthew Feinsod"], "id": "24200", "subject": "HUM"}]
