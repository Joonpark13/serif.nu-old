The phrase &quot;you are what you eat&quot; suggests that the act of eating is one of entrenchment: food choices represent and intensify one's own cultural and personal identity. But considering that issues of food access, obesity, and unfair or illegal food labor practices within the food system cut across race and class boundaries, this may now be an inaccurate - or at the very least - uncomfortable maxim. This course interrogates themes of identity, ethnicity, and nationalism by examining ?American cuisine' against the constraints of power and inequality in the US food system. We will focus on how national identity is constructed, affirmed, or refused through food choices by surveying foundational works within the field of food studies and connecting them to the pressing social issues of today, particularly as they manifest in the everyday activity of eating."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 7:00 PM (CT)", "subject": "HUM"}]
