[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course moves beyond liberal assumptions about religion, secularism and modernity to consider the complex entanglements of religion with human life, law, and public culture in the US and abroad. Beginning with the debates over yoga, the public display of cr\u00e8ches in the United States, and the question of who is a Jew in the United Kingdom, we will then move further afield to reflect on a series of dilemmas involving the law and politics of religious difference in other contexts. The course traverses disciplinary, geographic, and secular-religious boundaries, drawing on readings from politics, socio-legal studies, religious studies, anthropology, history, and popular culture. Students will also consider their own experiences of living with religious diversity, as we explore tools and strategies to think in new ways about the place of religion in the contemporary world.", "name": "Special Topics in the Humanities", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 3-410", "topic": "Religion and Politics Beyond Freedom and Violence", "course": "370-5", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 11:00AM - 12:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/HUM/370-5/24205", "instructor": ["Elizabeth S Hurd"], "class_attributes": "Ethics &amp; Values Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "24205", "subject": "HUM"}]
