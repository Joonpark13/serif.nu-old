Beginning with the debates over yoga, the public display of cr\u00e8ches in the United States, and the question of who is a Jew in the United Kingdom, we will then move further afield to reflect on a series of dilemmas involving the law and politics of religious difference in other contexts. The course traverses disciplinary, geographic, and secular-religious boundaries, drawing on readings from politics, socio-legal studies, religious studies, anthropology, history, and popular culture.
