Beginning with the debates over yoga, the public display of cr\u00e8ches in the United States, and the question of who is a Jew in the United Kingdom, we will then move further afield to reflect on a series of dilemmas involving the law and politics of religious difference in other contexts. The course traverses disciplinary, geographic, and secular-religious boundaries, drawing on readings from politics, socio-legal studies, religious studies, anthropology, history, and popular culture. Students will also consider their own experiences of living with religious diversity, as we explore tools and strategies to think in new ways about the place of religion in the contemporary world."}], "lmod": "12/25/16 7:01 PM (CT)", "subject": "HUM"}]
