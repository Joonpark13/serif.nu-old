Archaeology offers nationalist agendas the possibility of filling in national historical records and extending the past into prehistory; its results can be displayed in museums or at entire sites, potentially reaching a new audience outside the written word. In turn, nationalism contributed significantly to the emergence of archaeology as a modern discipline.<br/><br/>Drawing on new critical approaches and examples selected from a wide geographical range, this course explores the role of archaeology in the creation and elaboration of national identities. Issues include the institutionalization of archaeology; the development of museums and practices of display and interpretation; the creation of archaeological sites as national monuments and tourist destinations; cultural property legislation and repatriation of artifacts; and archaeology and monuments under totalitarian regimes."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Class participation: 30%<br/>Presentations: Presentation 20%<br/>Readings: Reading responses 20%<br/>Research project: Research paper 30%<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Readings will be made available on Canvas."}], "lmod": "12/24/16 7:02 PM (CT)", "subject": "HUM"}]
