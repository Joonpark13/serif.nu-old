The city`s magnificent streets and buildings both conceal and reveal a past full of multiethnic coexistence and interethnic conflict. The course aims to understand the development of Prague over the past two centuries from a multicultural, democratic city to a homogeneous, communist one, and ultimately to its present open and capitalist incarnation.\u00a0<br/>We will read a range of literary and historical sources, including the story of the Golem and writings by Milan Kundera, V\u00e1clav Havel, and Franz Kafka. We will also study the architecture of the city and watch several films set on its streets.\u00a0", "name": "German Contributions to World Literature", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-435", "topic": "", "course": "322-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 3:30PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/GERMAN/322-0/20519", "instructor": ["Martina F Kerlova"], "class_attributes": "Literature &amp; Fine Arts Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "20519", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
