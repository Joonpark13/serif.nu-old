[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Does Austria exist? Is there something like an Austrian culture? And if so, how does it differ from the German? <br/>This course will give a brief overview of Austrian literature, philosophy, music, and art from the 19th to the 21st century. It will focus on two exemplary periods. The first, commonly known as \"Die Wiener Moderne,\" spans the period from roughly 1890 to 1920. The second, exemplified by the collective of writers and artists named \"Wiener Gruppe,\" took place in 1960ies Vienna. In both cases the relation of art to political discourses will be central to our discussions. How does Austria construct its national identity vis-\u00e0-vis its neighbor Germany? What is it that makes Vienna the capital of the multi-cultural Austro-Hungarian Empire and the center for a various avant-garde art movements but also a hotbed of anti-semitism as well as the cradle of Nazi ideology?", "name": "Austrian Literature", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "223-0", "meeting_time": ["MoWeFr 11:00AM - 11:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/GERMAN/223-0/20542", "instructor": ["Jorg   Kreienbrock"], "id": "20542", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
