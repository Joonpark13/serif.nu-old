Is there something like an Austrian culture? And if so, how does it differ from the German? <br/>This course will give a brief overview of Austrian literature, philosophy, music, and art from the 19th to the 21st century. It will focus on two exemplary periods. The first, commonly known as &quot;Die Wiener Moderne,&quot; spans the period from roughly 1890 to 1920. The second, exemplified by the collective of writers and artists named &quot;Wiener Gruppe,&quot; took place in 1960ies Vienna. In both cases the relation of art to political discourses will be central to our discussions. How does Austria construct its national identity vis-\u00e0-vis its neighbor Germany? What is it that makes Vienna the capital of the multi-cultural Austro-Hungarian Empire and the center for a various avant-garde art movements but also a hotbed of anti-semitism as well as the cradle of Nazi ideology?"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Taught in German"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "Knowledge of Austrian history and culture from the 18th to the 21st century.<br/>Ability to read and analyze literary, scientific, and scholarly texts from the Austrian tradition.
