[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course looks at the notion of realism as both historical literary movement and epistemological/aesthetic problem. We will read classic theories of realism by Hegel, Auerbach, Barthes, Luk\u00e1cs, Blumenberg, and others, as well as significant new work by contemporary critics and theorists, together with exemplary texts of nineteenth-century European realist prose fiction. While the temporal focus of the\u00a0class will be mid-to late-nineteenth-century Europe and the\u00a0particular literary form that dominated at this time,\u00a0we will also go beyond this to look at the philosophical and\u00a0ideological underpinnings of the notion of \"realism\" itself. Special attention will be devoted to the following questions: the purpose of genre, the place of the human, the relationship between realism and reality (or the real), the elevation of the ordinary, and the possibilities and limits of representation.", "name": "History of Literature and Critical Thought 1832-1900", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-440", "topic": "Theories of Realism", "course": "402-0", "meeting_time": ["Th 3:00PM - 6:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/GERMAN/402-0/20540", "instructor": ["Erica Suzanne Weitzman"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "20540", "subject": "GERMAN"}]
