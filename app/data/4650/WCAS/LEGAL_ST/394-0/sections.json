[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Legal Studies 394-0-20 \"Lawyering: Education and Practice\", Seth Meyer, Winter 2017<br/><br/>Attorneys are central to American life and popular culture, but the profession is undergoing dramatic change. For years, the supply of lawyers has vastly outstripped the demand for legal jobs and the resulting lawyer bubble has grown. Meanwhile, those who land law jobs have different challenges: recent surveys report many attorneys' growing disenchantment with their work and dissatisfaction with their lives. This seminar will examine the profession's multidimensional crisis. What changes occur in attorneys, both individually and systemically, emerging from law schools and finding their roles in the legal realm? Why is working within the most lucrative big firms now regarded by many as the pinnacle of private practice? What other options are available? It will explore life after law school, examining the disparate places law graduates might find themselves. The course invites prospective law students to consider their potential places, as individual lawyers, in what remains a noble profession. It also invites those students in other undergraduate disciplines who may be curious about trajectories open to them in this post-graduate academic and, ultimately, career field.", "name": "Professional Linkage Seminar", "section": "20", "location": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-410", "topic": "", "course": "394-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/LEGAL_ST/394-0/22650", "instructor": ["Seth Adam Meyer"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "22650", "subject": "LEGAL_ST"}]
