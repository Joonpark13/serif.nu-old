[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines the relationship between law and the distribution of power in society, with a particular emphasis on law and social change in the United States. Readings will be drawn from the social sciences and history, as well as selected court cases that raise critical questions about the role of race, gender, and sexual orientation in American society. Among the material we will examine are the documents made public in the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Students should be aware that some of this material is graphic and disturbing.<br/>Students will be called on to discuss readings on a rotating basis. Students will write four short essays that critically engage the readings, some of which will be used for in class exercises.", "name": "Sociology of Law", "section": "20", "location": "555 Clark B03", "topic": "", "course": "308-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 9:30AM - 10:50AM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/LEGAL_ST/308-0/22664", "instructor": ["Robert L Nelson"], "class_attributes": "Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "22664", "subject": "LEGAL_ST"}]
