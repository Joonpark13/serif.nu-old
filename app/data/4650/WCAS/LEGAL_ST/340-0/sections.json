[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "This course is intended as a survey of how law has reflected and created distinctions on the basis of gender and sexuality throughout American history. We'll look at legal categories of gender and sexuality that have governed (and, often, continue to govern) the household (including marriage, divorce, and custody), the economy (including employment, property, and credit), and the political sphere (including voting, jury service, and citizenship). Throughout the course, we will examine the relationship between legal rules and social conditions, and discuss how various groups have challenged these legal categories.", "name": "Gender and the Law", "section": "20", "topic": "", "course": "340-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/LEGAL_ST/340-0/22663", "instructor": ["Joanna Lynn Grisinger"], "id": "22663", "subject": "LEGAL_ST"}]
