This course introduces the equations that govern fluids, and then shows how to solve them in a variety of contexts, including hydrostatics, shocks, waves, instabilities, and magnetohydrodynamics.<br/><br/>Various solution techniques are developed, while an emphasis is placed on understanding the dynamics and developing intuition with order of magnitude estimates. Applications include atmospheres, stars, accretion disks, stellar winds, and galactic disks."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites:<br/>300-level Classical Mechanics and Electricity &amp; Magnetism, and Math 250, (differential equations); or permission of instructor"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Lecture"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Homework and In-class presentations (60%) final exam (40%)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Principle of Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics (Clarke and Carswell)"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "value": "The Physics of Astrophysics, Volume II: Gas Dynamics (Shu)"}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:54 PM (CT)", "subject": "ASTRON"}]
