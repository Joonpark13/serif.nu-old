[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Fluid dynamics is one of the fundamental physical processes in astronomy. This course introduces the equations that govern fluids, and then shows how to solve them in a variety of contexts, including hydrostatics, shocks, waves, instabilities, and magnetohydrodynamics.<br/><br/>Various solution techniques are developed, while an emphasis is placed on understanding the dynamics and developing intuition with order of magnitude estimates. Applications include atmospheres, stars, accretion disks, stellar winds, and galactic disks.", "name": "Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics", "section": "1", "location": "Dearborn Observatory 23", "topic": "", "course": "416-0", "meeting_time": ["WeFr 1:30PM - 2:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ASTRON/416-0/20496", "instructor": ["Yoram   Lithwick"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "20496", "subject": "ASTRON"}]
