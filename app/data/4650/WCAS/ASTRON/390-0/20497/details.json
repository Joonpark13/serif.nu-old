Karl Jansky working at Bell Labs in New Jersey, changed everything by<br/>building a radio telescope that could observe the sky 24/7. This course surveys<br/>basics of radio astronomical techniques and advances that have been made since<br/>Jansky discovered radio emission from our Galaxy. We will discuss technical aspects<br/>of antenna theory, interferometers, signal processing and astronomical discoveries<br/>that have been made at radio wavelengths ranging between millimeters and meters. We<br/>will explain the mechanisms (e.g., synchrotron, thermal, masers) responsible for<br/>producing radio emission from stars, pulsars, supernova remnants, our Milky Way<br/>Galaxy and radio galaxies."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Prerequisites freshman physics and calculus, elementary quantum"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Essential Radio Astronomy<br/>James J.
