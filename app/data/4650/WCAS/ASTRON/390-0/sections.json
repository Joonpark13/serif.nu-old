[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "Before 1931, the study of the universe was limited to optical observations of the<br/>night sky. Karl Jansky working at Bell Labs in New Jersey, changed everything by<br/>building a radio telescope that could observe the sky 24/7. This course surveys<br/>basics of radio astronomical techniques and advances that have been made since<br/>Jansky discovered radio emission from our Galaxy. We will discuss technical aspects<br/>of antenna theory, interferometers, signal processing and astronomical discoveries<br/>that have been made at radio wavelengths ranging between millimeters and meters. We<br/>will explain the mechanisms (e.g., synchrotron, thermal, masers) responsible for<br/>producing radio emission from stars, pulsars, supernova remnants, our Milky Way<br/>Galaxy and radio galaxies.", "name": "Current Topics in Astronomy", "section": "1", "location": "Technological Institute F281", "topic": "", "course": "390-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 2:00PM - 3:20PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/ASTRON/390-0/20497", "instructor": ["Farhad Y Zadeh"], "class_attributes": "Natural Sciences Distro Area<br/><br/>", "id": "20497", "subject": "ASTRON"}]
