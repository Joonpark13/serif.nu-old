Eliot's formulation) Vergil's Aeneid presents itself simultaneously as a poetic mirror of &quot;everything&quot; (the cosmos itself, the place of gods and humans in it) and a meditation on the burden of Rome (?of founding Rome, of being Roman, of opposing Rome). It argues that the world-city is the fulfillment of a divine, cosmic plan, that its hero's burden of administering violence in a savage world is justified by the reward his descendants will reap - of eternally administering an empire won by violence and still threatened by savagery. &quot;Is it all worth it?&quot; We will read and discuss extensive selections from the 2nd half of the poem."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "Latin 201-3 or equivalent."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Virgil: Aeneid VII-XII <br/>Robert Deryck Williams (Editor)?<br/>ISBN 13: 978-1853995002"}], "lmod": "12/25/16 7:02 PM (CT)", "subject": "LATIN"}]
