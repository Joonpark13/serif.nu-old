[{"school": "WCAS", "overview_of_class": "The vortex of Latin literature and, arguably, \"the classic of all Europe\" (in T.S. Eliot's formulation) Vergil's Aeneid presents itself simultaneously as a poetic mirror of \"everything\" (the cosmos itself, the place of gods and humans in it) and a meditation on the burden of Rome (?of founding Rome, of being Roman, of opposing Rome). It argues that the world-city is the fulfillment of a divine, cosmic plan, that its hero's burden of administering violence in a savage world is justified by the reward his descendants will reap - of eternally administering an empire won by violence and still threatened by savagery. \"Is it all worth it?\" We will read and discuss extensive selections from the 2nd half of the poem.", "name": "Readings in Latin Literature", "section": "1", "topic": "", "course": "310-0", "meeting_time": ["TuTh 12:30PM - 1:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/WCAS/LATIN/310-0/22469", "instructor": ["John Kyrin Schafer"], "id": "22469", "subject": "LATIN"}]
