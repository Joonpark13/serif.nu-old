Students will engage in idiosyncratic surveillance of subjects and subject matter of their own choosing and generate speculative sketches, diagrams, other types of drawing and handwritten commentary. Potential topics for investigation could relate to the personal, popular culture, the everyday, politics, and/or the world but must be approached with a particular point-of-view, or several. To that end, students will experiment with narration and degrees of omniscience, objectivity and reliability. Readings and conversations on artists and writers who work with creative nonfiction, unreliable narration, diagramming, handwriting, the diaristic and the culture of conspiracy theory will also be a part of the course. There will be group discussions assessing smaller assignments and a group critique on one final, long-term project, an obsessive investigation. Art majors and non-art majors are welcome to enroll. While no prerequisite is required, students should enter into the course with a serious interest in sleuthing, drawing, writing, narration and a willingness to embellish the truth."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "There are no prerequisites for this class.<br/><br/>Attendance at the first class is mandatory."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Other: See course description<br/>"}, {"name": "Class Notes", "value": "First class mandatory.<br/>No pre-requisites apply."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:53 PM (CT)", "subject": "ART"}]
