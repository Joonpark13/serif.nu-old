In this course, we will focus on creating individual and collaborative art projects exploring the problem of endings in a variety of mediums including film, video, performance, and installation. An exploration of the theme will be considered through case studies of artists whose works investigate ideas of &quot;the end&quot; through topics such as love, death, war, and the environment, as well as take up Marxist and Queer theory perspectives. Critical readings will further question these ideas and meanings. The course will culminate in the presentation and critique of a final, synthesizing work.
