In this course, students will learn a new vocabulary for thinking and writing about music as a social phenomenon. They will gain a new understanding of the ways that music and social groups mutually shape one another in a constant cycle of cultural (re)production, and they will learn how sociologists have grappled with theorizing a cultural product that is at once so hard to pin down, yet so undeniably social. We'll explore a wide range of topics, such as the complicated relationships between music and markets, the rise of music as medicine covered by health insurance, the ways that subcultures use music to draw lines between us vs. them, the role that drill rap plays in Chicago homicides, and the ways that technologies like recorded music and headphones have forever changed the way societies perceive time and space.&quot;"}], "lmod": "12/24/16 6:51 PM (CT)", "subject": "SOCIOL"}]
