[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course investigates the societal and cultural reasons surrounding why we feel so angry and why we are attracted to acrimony. Our communication, from interpersonal all the way up to our media consumption, reflects our bitterness and need to relish and delight in the negative. We will explore issues such as emotional contagion, schadenfreude, misogyny, racism, as well as how emotions such as shame, guilt, and vulnerability add to our need to just be mad. We'll also ask teh question, Are times really worse? Or, are we just experiencing deja vu with a media filter that shows us exactly how to be enraged? On the other side, as anger is one of our core human emotions, so is joy. We will contemplate humor and satire and how it can bring us understanding as well as joy in the wake of our culture's ongoing commitment to rage. Finally, we will consider whether media is changing as our emotional reactions to it change as well.", "name": "Special Topics", "section": "65", "location": "University Hall 121", "topic": "Mad-Sad-Glad - Our Emotional Culture's Communicati", "course": "395-CN", "meeting_time": ["We 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SCS/COMM_ST/395-CN/27628", "instructor": ["Jennifer Lindsy Baker"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27628", "subject": "COMM_ST"}]
