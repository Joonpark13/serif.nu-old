[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course addresses factors affecting the spatial distribution of economic activity. We will start with a theoretical model grounded in common sense and core economic principles, then move to applications of the theoretical model and empirical analysis of urban problems. First, the course builds the urban monocentric model through parallel approaches: common sense, simple mathematical approach as well as through utility maximization. This model is then used as the core heuristic process for understanding urban and regional urban economic development including issues such as poverty, housing markets, zoning, employment, education, environmental problems, and racial discrimination. Different policy perspectives on these topics are evaluated through readings and applied problems worked out in class. The course ends by connecting the core urban economic framework developed to explain city development to a framework of cities within a wider economy.", "name": "Issues in Urban and Regional Economics", "section": "14", "topic": "", "course": "354-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SCS/ECON/354-CN/27566", "instructor": ["Brett Morgner Baden"], "id": "27566", "subject": "ECON"}]
