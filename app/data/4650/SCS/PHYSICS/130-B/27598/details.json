Harnessing the forces of electrical power; how they have altered the way we live and perceive ourselves in the universe. Lecture demonstrations illustrate physical principles: electricity and magnetism, DC and AC circuits. Requires concurrent enrollment in the PHYSICS 131-B lab. Lab times are Tuesdays 8-9:50 pm; Wednesdays 9-10:50 am; Saturdays 12-1:50 pm; or Saturdays 2-3:50 pm. Labs will meet for the first time after the first lecture session."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "PHYSICS 130-A or equivalent course."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Grades for this course are based on a two one hour in-class midterms, three hour final exam, and completion of homework assignments."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:50 PM (CT)", "subject": "PHYSICS"}]
