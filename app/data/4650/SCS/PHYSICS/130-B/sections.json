[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course is the continuation of PHYSICS 130-A algebra-based physics with lecture and laboratory; the sequence concludes with PHYSICS 130-C in the spring quarter. Harnessing the forces of electrical power; how they have altered the way we live and perceive ourselves in the universe. Lecture demonstrations illustrate physical principles: electricity and magnetism, DC and AC circuits. Requires concurrent enrollment in the PHYSICS 131-B lab. Lab times are Tuesdays 8-9:50 pm; Wednesdays 9-10:50 am; Saturdays 12-1:50 pm; or Saturdays 2-3:50 pm. Labs will meet for the first time after the first lecture session.", "name": "College Physics II", "section": "66", "location": "Technological Institute L211", "topic": "", "course": "130-B", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SCS/PHYSICS/130-B/27598", "instructor": ["Arthur Gerard   Schmidt"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27598", "subject": "PHYSICS"}]
