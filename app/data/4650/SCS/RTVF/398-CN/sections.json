[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "So much of what we take for granted in our contemporary media environment can be traced back to the innovations and trends in media of the 1980s. That decade saw the rise of cable TV and home video technologies, a boom in blockbusters and special effects films, conglomeration in media industries, and the spread of computers, video games, and digital media. In this course, we will interrogate films, television shows, and video games of the 1980s in order to see what they tell us about this period and the desires and fantasies popular at this time. We will explore the relationship between films like Rambo and The Empire Strikes Back to 1980s Cold War politics. The decade also saw a renewed cultural conservativism and we will analyze the influence this had on the style and narratives in films, television, and video games. In addition, we will consider the way that changes in technology and industry led to developments such as the growth of cable channels like MTV and Nickelodeon and the increasing prominence of blockbuster films. The class will include screenings of films and television programs from the 1980s as well as occasional video game demos.
