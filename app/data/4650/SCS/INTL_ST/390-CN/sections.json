[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course is a comparative study of famines, particularly as an intended weapon in a war, used against a competing political faction or part of empire. We will investigate how and why democracies are beset by droughts, but do not experience famines, looking at a range of countries, from Ethiopia and India to China and Ireland. The work of Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen, among others, will be covered. This course fulfills the 300-level course requirement for both History and Political Science majors.", "name": "Special Topics in International Studies", "section": "64", "topic": "Hunger &quot;Games&quot; - The Politics of Famine", "course": "390-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SCS/INTL_ST/390-CN/27629", "instructor": ["Jeffrey   Rice"], "id": "27629", "subject": "INTL_ST"}]
