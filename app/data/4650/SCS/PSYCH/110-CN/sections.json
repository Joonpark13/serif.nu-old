This course will give an overview to the entire field from a biological, psychological and socio-cultural perspective. We will discuss the history of psychology beginning with an overview of psychology's roots, observing how prevailing paradigms have shifted throughout the centuries. We'll then discuss how to think like a social scientist, with an attitude of open mindedness and skepticism, as we observe people in different social settings. Discussion will include the tools and methods that are used by social scientists to formulate their questions and propose answers. With the tools of neuroscience we will explore the biological underpinnings of mind and emotions and how they influence behavior. We will seek to understand and have empathy with individuals suffering from psychological disorders ranging from mild depression to severe psychosis. Discussion will cover ways to diagnose psychopathology and therapies that have been proposed to heal such internal suffering. Practical skills for coping with stress and emotions will also be explored. Finally, we try to uncover group dynamics that can give rise to pathological and sometimes destructive behavior as that observed in cults. The course will conclude with a theme of malleability that challenges assumptions about how we perceive, remember and think.
