[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Living systems perceive, represent, and interact with their surroundings in innumerable ways. Over the course of evolution, humans have converged upon a very specific set of representations and behaviors. The trajectories by which these representations and behaviors emerge over development illuminate fundamental aspects of human nature. In this course, students will learn how nature and nurture interact to sculpt the developing mind. Topics include biology and behavior, infancy, cognitive and social development, language and conceptual development, emotional and self development, adolescence and aging. While the course will cover human development from the moment of conception to old age, there will be an emphasis on early childhood. In addition to learning the methodologies and theoretical frameworks that developmental scientists use to understand the mind, students will be able to contextualize contemporary developmental psychology within millennia-old philosophical questions.
