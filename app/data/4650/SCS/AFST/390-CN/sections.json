[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course addresses one of the central puzzles in contemporary anthropology: namely, the relationship between international human rights, including social and economic rights, and the cultural norms and practices of local communities. It concerns a fundamental anthropological question of the translations and interactions between global culture and local cultures in relation to the human rights language of injustice. The course adopts an ethnographic case study approach to human rights language, practices, advocacy, and trials pertaining to a wide variety of countries, especially African countries, such as Burundi, Liberia, Uganda, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Sudan. Selected topics include gender violence and human rights, public health and human rights, refugees, and child soldiers. Many of the cases in the course deal with the human rights injustices of mass violence: war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide - as well as the post-conflict challenges of transitional justice, political reconstruction, and repair of social relations. Segments of ethnographic films will be used in class in order to add concrete detail to the case material in the readings. These films will also be uploaded on Canvas for students to consult outside the classroom. <br/><br/>This course is also listed as ANTHRO 390-CN Special Topics in Anthropology: Anthropology of Human Rights.
