Its hallmarks are a distinctive product, called an ethnography, and a particular research methodology called participant-observation. Together we will explore the world through the lens of childhood and adolescence, and experience the fieldwork of anthropologists through ethnographies written and visual. We will develop an understanding of what 'ethnography' is, both as a process and a product, as well as learn about cultural relativity and viewing social behavior from a cross-cultural perspective. Students will conduct ethnographic exercises to understand how fieldwork observations and analysis are context dependent. A particular emphasis in course lectures, discussion, and activities will attend to the ways in which qualitative research methods such as ethnographic interviews and participant-observation provide one approach to documenting and understanding social life.
