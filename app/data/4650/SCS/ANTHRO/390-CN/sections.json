It concerns a fundamental anthropological question of the translations and interactions between global culture and local cultures in relation to the human rights language of injustice. The course adopts an ethnographic case study approach to human rights language, practices, advocacy, and trials pertaining to a wide variety of countries, especially African countries, such as Burundi, Liberia, Uganda, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Sudan. Selected topics include gender violence and human rights, public health and human rights, refugees, and child soldiers. Many of the cases in the course deal with the human rights injustices of mass violence: war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide - as well as the post-conflict challenges of transitional justice, political reconstruction, and repair of social relations. Segments of ethnographic films will be used in class in order to add concrete detail to the case material in the readings.

The basic anthropological concepts and methods needed for the course will be introduced and clarified as case analyses are introduced. Of course, previous social science courses - anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology - can be helpful background."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "value": "The goal of the course is to introduce students to a way of thinking about social justice and injustices by applying basic ideas and methods from social and cultural anthropology to human rights case material. An important part of this learning objective is to understand the role of language and communication in the institution of human rights discourse at global and local levels."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Classes will be structured as a combination of lecture and seminar discussion, with an emphasis on ethnographic case studies discussed and analyzed in class. Segments of ethnographic films will be used to complement the case material in the readings, and to stimulate discussion in class. Short problem sets will be assigned as exercises for clarifying key anthropological concepts and for using those concepts to make arguments about justice and injustice in particular ethnographic case material. Students will present their problem sets in class as part of seminar discussion."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "value": "Instead of a midterm exam, four short problem sets of 2-2 1/2 double-spaced pages will be required. Instead of a final exam, a final take home paper of 8-10 double-spaced pages will be assigned. The final paper will be similar to the problem set papers and make use of ethnographic films on Canvas as case material. Each short paper/problem set will be worth 10 points. The final paper is worth 50 points. Borderline grades (e.g., A- versus B+) will be decided by class participation. The expectation is that students will study thoroughly reading assignments in preparation for each class period of discussion and debate."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "value": "Four books are required (available at NU Bookstore, Evanston): 1) Clapham, Andrew. 2015.
