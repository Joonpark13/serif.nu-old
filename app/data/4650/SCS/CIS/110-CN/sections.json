[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course is designed as an introduction to programming practices for students who have no previous programming background and who are not Information Systems majors. Students learn a systematic approach to solving problems through software solutions. This basic programming course teaches variables, constants, conditionals, looping and user-defined methods. Students will analyze, design, program, and test their programs. This course includes interactive lectures and labs. Students will be required to complete multiple computer programs and quizzes. A final assignment is required for students to illustrate their understanding of all programming topics covered in the course. May not be audited or taken P/N.<br/><br/>We begin the course by installing the Java software (JDK and JRE), and discussing the Java architecture. Our first lectures cover Java variable declaration and initialization, and basic input/output. From there we move on to Java conditional statements (if, if else, if else if, and switch). Next, we cover the iterations available in Java: while, do while and for. We conclude the course by covering the basics of arrays, a GUI interface and objects.Typically, course assignments include four open-book quizzes and six programming asssignments. The programming assignments usually include at least four indiviudual programs. The final programming assignment covers the entire course and is a program you can design yourself. To share your knowledge learned and your final program, you present your final assignment in an informal class discussion.", "name": "Introduction to Computer Programming", "section": "12", "topic": "", "course": "110-CN", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SCS/CIS/110-CN/27578", "instructor": ["Jacqueline Ann Bird"], "id": "27578", "subject": "CIS"}]
