[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is an area of research that encompasses usability, design, information architecture, psychology, ethnography, and software engineering. In this course, we draw on these disciplines to understand how people interact with technological systems in everyday life. The main focus of this course will apply a user centered design approach to iteratively develop and evaluate a prototype. Course topics include: contextual interviews, design process, prototype construction, and evaluation techniques. While no prior programming experience is required the student will benefit from experience with computing conventions as well as appreciation and willingness to learn.", "name": "Human Computer Interaction", "section": "12", "topic": "", "course": "330-CN", "meeting_time": ["We 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SCS/CIS/330-CN/27583", "instructor": ["Sarah   D'Angelo"], "id": "27583", "subject": "CIS"}]
