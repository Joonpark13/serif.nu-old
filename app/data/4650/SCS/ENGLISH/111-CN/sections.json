[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "There is no question that movies influence every aspect of our culture, from ideas on lifestyle and morality to race relations and international politics. But what exactly is the relationship between the movies and the way we think and behave? What are the cinematic themes that have touched the American public from the early days of movies to the present, embodied in the work of great directors such as Frank Capra, Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee and Oliver Stone? These questions are explored in an intensive five-week workshop and seminar in which students develop the skills needed to write thoughtful college research papers. Because of the rigorous and fast-paced nature of the class, students should have completed English 110 or an equivalent class in writing fundamentals. Presented in a five-week format, this course meets for five Saturdays from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm: 1/9, 1/16, 1/23, 1/30 and 2/6. First class attendance is mandatory.", "name": "Writing Seminar II", "section": "17", "topic": "Movies, Culture, and Society", "course": "111-CN", "meeting_time": ["Sa 9:00AM - 4:00PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SCS/ENGLISH/111-CN/27567", "instructor": ["Michelle W.
