[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This workshop course is for students who have taken courses in creative nonfiction or who have been writing creative nonfiction on their own. Students apply their developing command of creative writing techniques and forms to frequent short writing exercises and essays. Class discussion of published essays and excerpts from longer works and student drafts may address such topics as voice, style, structure, the uses of research, and truth. <br/><br/>Readings and discussions will be built around old and contemporary works of nonfiction that are surprising counterparts-Virgil's Georgics with podcasts and blogs, 18th-century sermons with video essays, medieval pageants and cinepoetry. We will also look at manifestos and works of revolution and breakthrough, and discuss ways to evaluate and critique new work. The workshop portion of class will be completely open to any sort of creative nonfiction that students wish to bring to a supportive group. Writers working in or drawn to other genres (fiction, poetry) are encouraged to enroll. <br/><br/>Readings and viewings may include: Virgil, Karen Brennan, Theodore Adorno, Futurist manifestos, Jonathan Swift, Claudia Rankine, John Bresland, Tom Phillips, W.G. Sebald, and others.
