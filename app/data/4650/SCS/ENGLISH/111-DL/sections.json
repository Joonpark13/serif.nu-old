[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Ever since we declared its pursuit as one of our inalienable rights, Americans have been hot on the trail of a happiness that often seems to be just beyond our grasp. The hunt takes many paths: finding love, wealth, or fame; earning an education, job, or lifestyle; attaining bliss, heaven, or a fairy tale ending. This writing class explores how we have defined, pursued and, at times, attained happiness. We ask the question: \"is happiness a goal or a journey?\" We examine how the ideal of happiness finds expression in our culture through philosophy, art, literature, music, and film. We also explore social phenomena such as the quest for higher education, the explosion of the self-help industry, and the ebb and flow of our consumer culture.<br/><br/>The course is conducted completely online. It will be asynchronous; students can participate in discussions and complete assignments by working at their own pace, as long as deadlines are met. A technology fee will be added to tuition.", "name": "Writing Seminar II", "section": "12", "location": "TBA", "topic": "The Pursuit of Happiness", "course": "111-DL", "meeting_time": ["TBA"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SCS/ENGLISH/111-DL/27568", "instructor": ["Leslie   Fischer"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27568", "subject": "ENGLISH"}]
