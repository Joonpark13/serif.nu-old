[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course examines aspects of aging, from molecular to evolutionary, and explores what is presently known about how and why we age. Through discussions of primary literature, students will explore various biological processes and disease states related to aging. Rather than providing a comprehensive overview, this course aims to develop a fundamental framework for how to think about the biology of aging and the ability to read and analyze current scientific literature.", "name": "Biology of Aging", "section": "66", "location": "Technological Institute M177", "topic": "", "course": "327-CN", "meeting_time": ["Th 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SCS/BIOL_SCI/327-CN/27540", "instructor": ["Thomas A Volpe"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27540", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
