[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course is the third course in a four-course sequence that is completed by BIOL SCI 308 in the spring. The cell biology course covers mechanisms that cells use to compartmentalize and transport proteins, to move, to regulate growth and death, and to communicate with their environments. <br/><br/>This course was formerly BIOL SCI 216. Students who have previously taken BIOL SCI 216 should not register for this course. A lab course, BIOL SCI 221 Cellular Processes Laboratory, may be taken concurrently with this course.", "name": "Cell Biology", "section": "62", "topic": "", "course": "219-CN", "meeting_time": ["Mo 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SCS/BIOL_SCI/219-CN/27533", "instructor": ["Michele M McDonough"], "id": "27533", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
