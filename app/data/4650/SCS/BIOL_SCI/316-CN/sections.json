[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "Students will gain a good working knowledge of the function of the musculoskeletal system in modern humans in this course, along with a comparative perspective emphasizing the adaptive contexts of the evolutionary transformations leading to our modern anatomy. The course examines the structural, functional, and evolutionary anatomy of humans, with primary focus on the musculoskeletal system of the postcranium. The regional anatomy of the muscles, bones and joints in the human body serves as a basis for more general biomechanical principles of anatomical systems. Discussions of the development evolution and clinical significance of human structure complement the functional emphasis on these anatomical regions. Class lectures are supplemented by selected prosections of human cadavers, in-class lab sessions examining bones and models, and computer animations and exercises.", "name": "Human Structure and Function", "section": "14", "location": "Wieboldt Hall 413", "topic": "", "course": "316-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SCS/BIOL_SCI/316-CN/27537", "instructor": ["Brian T Shea"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27537", "subject": "BIOL_SCI"}]
