[{"school": "SCS", "overview_of_class": "This course is focused on definite integrals and the fundamental theorem of calculus. Techniques of integration including integration by parts, trigonometric integrals, trigonometric substitutions, partial fractions, numerical integration, and improper integrals are covered. Topics also include: applications of integration (computation of volumes, arc length, average value of functions, the mean value theorem for integration, work and probability), sequences and series (the integral and comparison tests, power series, ratio test, introduction to Taylor's formula and Taylor series, using series to solve differential equations).", "name": "Integral Calculus of One Variable Functions", "section": "64", "topic": "", "course": "224-CN", "meeting_time": ["Tu 6:15PM - 9:15PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/SCS/MATH/224-CN/27591", "instructor": ["Amy Beth Alznauer"], "id": "27591", "subject": "MATH"}]
