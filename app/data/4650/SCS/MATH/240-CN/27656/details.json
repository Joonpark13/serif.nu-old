The key objects of studies are so-called matrices, which provide convenient ways of encoding a large amount of data. Despite its seemingly humble beginnings, linear algebra has arisen to become one of the most important and applicable fields of mathematics, due essentially to the fact that a wide variety of phenomena in other subjects can be characterized in terms of matrices and their properties. We will focus on these properties, introducing many applications along the way which showcase their power."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "value": "MATH 230 or equivalent."}], "lmod": "12/29/16 6:50 PM (CT)", "subject": "MATH"}]
