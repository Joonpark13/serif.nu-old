Topics will be chosen from set theory, combinatorics (the art of counting), finite probability, elementary linear algebra and its applications to linear optimization problems. Among other things, the course will focus on practical applications of these mathematical tools to real-life situations, such as analyzing survey data, probability tests, supply and demand linear functions and equilibrium prices in economy, minimizing linear cost functions and maximizing linear profit functions in business. Upon completing the course, students will be able to transform real-world tasks into mathematical problems, manipulate (systems of) linear equations and optimizations, and solve counting problems in a systematic way.", "qtr": "Winter 2017", "name": "Finite Mathematics", "title": "SCS MATH 202-CN-65 Finite Mathematics", "lmod": "2/5/17 6:39 PM (CT)", "section": "65", "instructors": [{"instructor_phone": "", "instructor_name": "Ross Walker Sweet", "instructor_addr": ""}], "topic": "", "course": "202-CN", "enrl_requirement": "", "descriptions": [{"name": "Overview of class", "value": "This course serves as a foundation of mathematical knowledge targeting data analysis.
