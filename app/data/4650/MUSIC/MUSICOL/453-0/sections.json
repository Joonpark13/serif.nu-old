[{"school": "MUSIC", "overview_of_class": "Seminar in Galant Music<br/>Topic: Opera Seria and its Sources<br/><br/>This graduate seminar focuses on 18th-century Italian opera seria as performative spectacle rooted in neo-classicism. Focusing upon operas by Hasse and Jommelli with librettos by Metastasio, as well as comparative examples from Handel, J. C. Bach, and others, the course will explore the sources of opera seria librettos in the literature of classical antiquity, engage recent musicological scholarship about the voice, body, and operatic performativity, contextualize operatic topics with Enlightenment thought, and explore the notated and improvisational conventions of galant music. Over the quarter, each student will research the history of a specific libretto by Metastasio, assess the operatic output of one 18th-century Italian composer, explore performance practice, and develop a paper on a related topic. Knowledge of Italian helpful but not essential.", "name": "Seminar in 18th Century Music", "section": "20", "location": "RCMA Lower Level 113", "topic": "Seminar in Galant Music", "course": "453-0", "meeting_time": ["Tu 2:00PM - 4:50PM"], "path": "/class-descriptions/4650/MUSIC/MUSICOL/453-0/27378", "instructor": ["Drew Edward Davies"], "class_attributes": "", "id": "27378", "subject": "MUSICOL"}]
