Our reading will come from ethnomusicology, historical musicology, and critical race studies. We will examine how musical representations and experiences participate in the creation of public and private notions of race and nation. We will grapple with the power of music to mediate imagined and embodied formations of self, community, and otherness.<br/><br/>The course will give students a broad foundation for discussing matters of music, race, and nationalism, and specific examples will be drawn from the history European imperialism, the transatlantic African diaspora, and the contemporary struggles over defining nationhood in the United States in our contemporary moment."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "value": "Coursework will center on readings (typically about 80 pages per week) and in-class discussion.
