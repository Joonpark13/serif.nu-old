Your grade will be based on your ongoing work, class participation, and a 10-page (minimum) final project encompassing the background/design/methods (and results if possible) sections of a research article. Since so much of the grade depends on your progress, please keep up with the work at all times. Please note that without active participation in class discussions the highest grade possible is a B+.<br/>Grades will be given on the following basis:<br/> Ongoing work, daily project reports 60%<br/> Final project 30%<br/> Class participation. 10%<br/> Total 100%"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "value": "The primary use of texts in this course is to help you identify a music-cognitive topic of interest to you, become familiar with the prior literature on that topic, and design an experiment of your own.
